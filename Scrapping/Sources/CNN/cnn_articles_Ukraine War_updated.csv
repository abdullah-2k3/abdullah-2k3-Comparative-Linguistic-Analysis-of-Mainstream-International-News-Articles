The operation marked the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II – embarrassing the Kremlin and proving to Kyiv’s backers and the rest of the world that Ukraine’s military was not perpetually on the back foot. Some nine weeks later, Ukraine’s advance has stalled, and neither side has made major gains or counterattacks in recent days. The endgame is unclear. Analysts believe Kyiv is trying to use its initial momentum for a morale boost and a potential bargaining chip, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to downplay the entire incursion and limit the resources Russia’s war machine devotes to countering it. What’s the latest on the ground? Ukraine has maintained a foothold in Kursk of about 786 square kilometers (300 square miles), according to the latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank in Washington, DC. “Russian advances are mostly happening on the flanks of our foothold,” a commander of a Ukrainian battalion inside Kursk, Dmytro – who uses the call sign “Kholod,” meaning cold – told CNN on Wednesday. “They keep trying to advance but the gains are incremental, somewhere they manage to take a street in the village. But it goes both ways – we also counterattack and push them back.” Ukraine’s main foothold is around the Russian town of Sudzha and its military is trying to establish a second foothold around Veseloe village. Ukraine has not disclosed how many troops it has sent to the region. Russia has deployed a reasonably large number of troops – estimated at 40,000 – to defend and counterattack in Kursk, but analyst Mark Galeotti described the initial force as “built from wherever they can find,” with Russia using conscripts and reservists at the outset of the incursion. “This is equivalent to sort of scramping around your sofa cushions to find some small change,” Galeotti, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a British think tank, told CNN. Moscow has since deployed more experienced forces, but not as many resources as Russian civilians in Kursk would perhaps want. Displaced people in an undisclosed location in the Kursk region are housed in a shelter on August 29, 2024, following Ukraine's cross-border incursion. Tatyana Makeyeva/AFP/Getty Images As fighting in the area continues, Russian authorities say more than 100,000 civilians have been displaced, while many others find themselves living behind Ukrainian lines. “Over time, there is a degree to which the Kursk operation has become normalized,” Galeotti said. “We shouldn’t assume that Russians have just come to accept it… I think Putin has managed to postpone judgment, but I don’t think it’s been completely waived.” Why hasn’t Russia’s response been stronger? Russia is trying to avoid diverting any resources from the frontlines of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine to fight in Kursk. Although the incursion was initially a shock to both the government and ordinary Russians, “the Kremlin has played this down,” according to John Lough, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Program. “The strategy is to distract the population from what’s happened, which is undoubtedly a major embarrassment, and to create the impression that this is not serious.” Putin’s government has characterized it as a “raid” and even downplayed their counterattack as a “counterterrorism mission.” One Russian military blogger put the normalization into stark words, saying: “Most of Russia has already got used to the fighting near Kursk… Those who have nothing to do with the Kursk region are rather sluggishly interested in what is happening.” Frontlines are moving only slightly, but the fighting is reportedly fierce, with Russian forces deploying numerous drones, barrel artillery and aerial bombers, according to the Ukrainian commander. “They don’t hesitate to drop a bomb on a tree line if they assume we have troops there,” Ukrainian battalion commander “Kholod” said. He claims Russia has now sent a powerful group of troops and combat brigades to where his unit is fighting in Kursk, and argued the Russian counterattack was staved off by Ukraine’s drone and mine attacks. What has Ukraine achieved? The incursion into Kursk likely had multiple goals, analysts say, including giving Ukraine a narrative win. “Their goal was to demonstrate to Ukraine’s Western allies that the Russians are vulnerable and that there are limits to their ability to deploy combat power,” said Lough, adding that the incursion also highlighted how “Russia’s red lines are rhetorical.” It also provided a morale boost for Ukrainians. Several soldiers who spoke to CNN in September said that despite casualties and difficult operations, giving Russia a taste of its own medicine was worth the fight. Ukraine has maintained control of about 300 square miles in Russia's Kursk region, according to the latest assessment by ISW. Oleg Palchyk/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images Yet Ukraine’s goal of diverting troops from the eastern frontline to Kursk has so far failed. Kursk could still be a bargaining chip for negotiations in the future, though, experts said. “By taking this territory, they immediately ruled out the possibility of both the Russians and the Western allies saying, ‘Now it’s time to stop. Let’s have a ceasefire,’” Lough said. Focus still on eastern Ukraine Meanwhile, the primary focus of the war remains on the frontlines in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where its troops are fighting to retain control of the strategic city of Pokrovsk . Rather than focus resources on liberating their own territory, the Russian military has expanded its assaults on multiple fronts in Ukraine, including in key areas of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. “It seems to be a very high priority for the Kremlin to advance as far as possible in Donbas, regardless of the losses,” Lough added. “There is a sort of window that is about to close, because you get to this time of year when the roads turn to mud.” Russia’s daily attacks on Ukraine continued Thursday, with several people killed in the regions of Odesa, Kherson and Donetsk."

The meeting at a regional summit in Ashgabat, the capital of the Central Asian country Turkmenistan, also comes against a backdrop of closer military ties between Iran and Russia’s military in recent years, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Iran has supplied thousands of “Shahed” attack drones to Russia, and according to US officials, built a drone factory in Russia. Iran also recently transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use in the war against Ukraine, CNN reported in September, marking a significant escalation in the country’s support for Moscow. “We are actively working together in the international arena and our assessments of events taking place in the world are often very close,” Putin said during the landmark meeting, according to Russian state media outlet TASS. “Since Ukraine, the two countries have been more equal in terms of both needing each other and relying each other on specific issues. And that, I think, has been seen as beneficial from the Iranian side,” said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, senior analyst and associate fellow, at UK think tank Chatham House and senior analyst at the consultancy Control Risks. Moscow and Tehran have a de facto military alliance in the region to support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Analysts say the countries have found further common ground as they are increasingly isolated by global sanctions.

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla) Hussein Malla/AP Related live-story Iran will attack Israel again if necessary, supreme leader says in rare speech There is a perception in Moscow that Iran can teach Russia about the tools to evade sanctions, Bassiri Tabrizi noted, adding, “I think it’s overall a goal from the Iranian side, so that has been part of the broader conversation about being part of the BRICS,” the bloc of major emerging economies that Iran formally joined early this year. Pezeshkian, a reformist who won Iran’s election in July following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, has already emphasized his desire to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Russia to counter the “cruel” sanctions of the West. In a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in Tehran last week, the Iranian leader called for accelerating joint projects. Meanwhile, Russia expressed interest in expanding trade and economic cooperation as well as diversifying its bilateral trade with Iran. The Russian prime minister also invited Pezeshkian to attend the October BRICS summit in Russia, where the two countries are expected to sign a comprehensive strategic agreement. The Russian foreign ministry has touted these meetings as evidence that Russia-Iran relations are at an “all-time high,” according to TASS. Ahead of the meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the agenda will focus on “primarily bilateral Russian-Iranian relations,” according to TASS. “But, of course, the situation in the Middle East will not be ignored, it will also be on the agenda. In any case, there will be a serious conversation.” There have also been reports of Russian involvement in arms transfers to the Iran-backed Houthis. Viktor Bout, the Russian arms dealer who was exchanged in a prisoner swap for American basketball star Brittney Griner, has allegedly reentered the arms trade to broker the sale of $10 million worth of automatic weapons to the Yemen-based rebels, The Wall Street Journal and other Western media outlets reported this week, citing unnamed Western officials. Bout has denied that. However, developments in the Middle East have not necessarily strengthened Iran-Russia relations, Bassiri Tabrizi noted, and some analysts argue that Russia stands to benefit from the conflicts involving Iranian proxies distracting from the war in Ukraine on the international stage. “We know that Russia is very much focusing on what’s going on in Ukraine. It probably cannot stretch itself much in terms of delivery of technical and military capability to Iran beyond a certain point,” the Chatham House analyst told CNN in a statement. “While the relationship has been growing and is likely to continue to grow, there are going to be some continued tensions, some continued misalignment.” CNN’s Gianluca Mezzofiore, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report."

In an annex attached to a classified report about the Biden administration’s Ukraine strategy that was delivered to Congress early last month, Gen. Chris Cavoli outlined a list of US capabilities that could help the Ukrainian military fight more effectively, according to people familiar with the report. The list included the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, a type of air-launched cruise missile, and a communications system known as the Link 16 — a data sharing network used by the US and NATO that is supposed to enable more seamless communication between battle systems and is particularly useful for air and missile defense command and control. Ukraine has asked for both systems repeatedly, another source familiar with their requests said. Cavoli’s list does not address why the US hasn’t provided systems that he assesses would be of value. But US officials have previously expressed concerns about sensitive US technology falling into Russian hands, which one source said is likely the holdup with the Link 16 system. The air-to-surface missiles, which are fired from fighter jets, might not be useful to the Ukrainians unless they achieve some level of air superiority, the source added. Nearly three years into the war, the Ukrainians are still pleading with the US to provide more advanced weaponry and lift restrictions on how long-range missile systems provided by the US can be used. And with the US presidential election less than one month away, the future of the US’ support for Ukraine is uncertain, even as the US says it is working to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to last them through at least the end of 2025. The Ukrainian government continues to lobby hard. When President Volodymyr Zelensky met with President Joe Biden at the White House late last month, he came armed with a detailed list—not of weapons, but of targets inside Russia that he wants to hit with US-provided long-range missiles, known as ATACMS, according to sources familiar with the meeting. The list is a key part of Zelensky’s “victory plan” for winning the war. Biden, who has to date prohibited the Ukrainians from deploying the missile systems for deep strikes into Russia, was not entirely dismissive of the request, the sources said. But he was ultimately non-committal. The leaders agreed to keep discussing the issue. But Biden won’t be meeting with Zelensky again in the near future after he canceled a trip to Germany for a gathering of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group this week, and it remains unlikely that the US will change its policy on long-range missiles, officials told CNN. Broadly, US officials say they are giving Ukraine everything that the US military assesses Kyiv needs at this moment to support its fight. Officials also argue that that the US’ limited supply of long-range ATACMS systems are better used against targets in Crimea. The Ukrainians have already conducted several successful strikes deep inside Russia using their own long-range drones that have damaged Russia’s defense industrial base, US officials note — drones that in fact have a far longer range than the ATACMs. US officials have also said that Russia has moved some of its most valuable targets outside of the ATACMS’ 180-mile range, anyway. The Ukrainians have argued, though, that there are plenty of Russian assets within range, including military bases and production and logistics facilities, that would make for strategic targets. As a way to “Trump-proof” US security aid, should former President Donald Trump win in November, the US and its allies have been working on ways to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs through the end of 2025. NATO has established its own mechanism for facilitating aid and military training, which was launched in July. The Pentagon is also getting closer to offering contracts to private American companies to travel to the country and help with the equipment sustainment and logistics there, officials said, a key part of making sure Ukraine’s weapons and equipment don’t break down at key moments. Broadly, though, the US is hoping that 2025 marks a turning point for Russia’s ability to sustain its own war effort. Russia has lost hundreds of thousands of fighters in close to three years of fighting. To make any substantial gains on the battlefield, officials have long believed President Vladimir Putin will need to order another politically risky troop mobilization. And both US officials and independent analysts say that although the Kremlin has successfully shielded its economy from some of the bite of western sanctions in the near-term, there are some signs that its economy may begin to show strain by the end of next year. Putin “always thinks Americans have attention deficit disorder,” CIA Director Bill Burns said during a national security conference in Sea Island, Georgia, on Monday. “This is one of those cases where we have to demonstrate the strength of our support for Ukraine, because there’s a lot riding on this.” Still, critics say that the administration’s plan for victory in Ukraine remains fuzzy. According to one source who read the report, the classified strategy delivered to Congress defined victory only in vague terms of Ukrainian sovereignty and self-determination. In another classified annex, it suggested categorized that might be used to judge success, such as reclaimed territory, but provided no benchmarks. For now, the picture on the battlefield remains fluid. Russia has made grinding gains in the country’s east, which officials see as Putin’s priority. Ukraine earlier in the year seized a huge swath of territory inside Russia that it continues to hold, for now, a move that some officials believe may stretch Kyiv too thin across the front lines in the east."

Dadin was once jailed in Russia for repeatedly protesting the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a series of peaceful street demonstrations. He was the first person to be convicted under a 2014 law that cracked down on public assembly and protests in Russia, according to Amnesty International . He served two and a half years in prison and the article under which he was tried became known as “Dadin’s law.” Dadin’s friend and former Russian lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev, who is living in exile, said Monday he was killed fighting in the Kharkiv region over the weekend. “Ildar saw Ukraine as an ally in this struggle, and in forceful resistance the only way to defeat Putinism,” Ponomarev told CNN, adding that Dadin went to Ukraine in June 2023 and joined the country’s Siberian Battalion and later the Freedom of Russia Legion, a group of primarily Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine. “He had a keen sense of justice, so when he saw that there was an injustice – a war, an invasion, people were dying – he had to correct that injustice,” Ponomarev added. The Freedom of Russia Legion confirmed Dadin was one of their soldiers but declined to comment on his condition and status on Monday due to ongoing combat operations. Several independent Russian media outlets also reported Dadin’s death on Sunday. More strikes on Ukraine overnight Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine overnight, with Ukrainian authorities reporting four people killed and at least 25 injured in attacks on the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson and Sumy regions. Ukraine said it shot down 32 Russian drones and two missiles overnight and on Monday morning. Ukraine also repelled a drone and missile attack on its capital on Monday. It marked the fourth Russian attack on Kyiv since the start of October, according to the head of the city’s military administration Serhiy Popko. Meanwhile, the General Staff of Ukraine reported that it successfully struck an offshore oil terminal in Russian-occupied Crimea, near the city of Feodosia. The Russia-appointed head of the Feodosia city administration, Igor Tkachenko, confirmed on Telegram that there was a fire at the oil terminal, which is the largest in Crimea. A state of emergency was declared in Feodosia due to the fire. CNN’s Nathan Hodge contributed to this report."

Hubbard, originally from Michigan, was accused of fighting against Russia for monetary compensation and pleaded guilty last month to charges of being a mercenary, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. Russian prosecutors alleged that Hubbard fought with Ukraine in the key city of Izyum, after signing a contract for about $1,000 per month, RIA previously reported. He was detained by Russian forces in April 2022. “Yes, I agree with the charges,” Hubbard told the Moscow City Court in his September plea hearing. His trial and sentencing took place behind closed doors in the Moscow court. Hubbard’s sister, Trisha Hubbard Fox, previously said he held pro-Russian views and cast doubt on his confession, telling Reuters in an interview that “he never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that… He’s more of a pacifist.” “RUSSIA’s prosecutor is LYING!!! Steve was never a mercenary. He was an English teacher teaching English in foreign countries!” his sister added in a post on Facebook last month. Earlier on Monday, a Russian court sentenced another American citizen, former marine Robert Gilman, to seven years and one month in a maximum-security penal colony for assaulting law enforcement officers, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. Robert Gilman was sentenced to more than seven years in prison at a Monday court hearing in Voronezh, Russia. Vladimir Lavrov/Reuters Gilman is already serving time in a Russian prison after he was sentenced in October 2022 to more than four years for an attack on a police officer, according to Reuters. His sentence was later reduced to 3.5 years. Gilman’s latest sentencing, in the Russian city of Voronezh, is in relation to his alleged assault of a prison official and a state investigator. A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Moscow told CNN the Embassy is aware of the detention of two American citizens but declined to comment further citing privacy concerns.

Heavy rain overnight halted search, Bosnian media reported, but as it stopped the search continued. In Donja Jablanica many houses were still under rubble. Nezima Begovic, 62, was lucky. Her house is damaged, but she came out unhurt. “I heard people screaming and suddenly it was all quiet. Then I said everyone is dead there,” she told Reuters.

Enes Imamovic, 66, said he was woken by loud noises at around 5 a.m. on Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday). “Everything was white (from the stones and dust that came down from the quarry), My friends’ house was gone. I heard screams,” Imamovic told Reuters. The Bosnian Football Association (NFSBIH) has postponed all matches due to floods. Bosnia’s election commission decided to postpone local elections this weekend in municipalities affected by floods, but to carry on with voting elsewhere. The floods follow an unprecedented summer drought which caused many rivers and lakes to dry up, and affected agriculture and the supply of water to urban areas throughout the Balkans and much of Europe . Meteorologists said extreme weather changes can be attributed to climate change ."

Footage verified by CNN showed troops waving the Russian flag over the ruins of the city hall of the devastated town, whose population has dropped from around 14,000 to just over a hundred. Ukraine’s military confirmed its withdrawal from Vuhledar Wednesday, noting Russia had managed to send reserves on the flanks, leading to the “threat of encirclement.” The decision to withdraw, it said, was taken “to save personnel and military equipment.” A key goal of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is to take the whole of the eastern Donbas region. Russia has been making incremental gains this year in the east and the loss comes as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky returns from a meeting with US President Joe Biden without his key demands met. Vladimir Putin's nuclear warning came as Ukraine presses the United States to provide long-range weapons that would allow it to strike deep within Russia. Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik/Reuters Related article Putin revises his nuclear doctrine, but have his red lines shifted? Vuhledar, a town built around a coal mine (its name comes from the Ukrainian word for coal), sits some 50km (30 miles) south of Pokrovsk, viewed for the past few months as Russia’s main nexus of attack in the east. While not a transport and logistics hub like Pokrovsk, Vuhledar was heavily fortified and viewed as a crucial bastion at the intersection of Ukraine’s eastern and southern fronts. One prominent Russian war blogger Boris Rozhin said this made the victory “operational, if not operational-strategic.” “The fact is that this ‘balcony’ [an apparent reference to Vuhledar’s elevated position] was located at the junction of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk fronts posed a constant threat to the grouping that covered the approaches to Mariupol,” he noted, referring to the southern Ukrainian city that has been in Russian hands since 2022. Just like Avdiivka, another strategic eastern town which fell in February, Vuhledar is a victim not of Russian strategic prowess but brute-force attrition. For two years Ukraine had put up a formidable defense there, as Russia tried and failed several times to take the town. In February 2023 , an attempted Russian assault on Vuhledar led to an uproar among pro-Kremlin military bloggers, as hundreds of Russian troops advanced right into the crosshairs of Ukrainian artillery, launched from the town’s high-rise apartment blocks. Another Russian blogger, Voenkor Kotenok, alluded to this bittersweet victory Tuesday. “It’s painful, Vuhledar or rather those who settled there, drank a lot of blood,” he said. Now, it is Ukraine that will face the difficult questions. A fresh blow to Ukraine The fact that Russia was able to bring in sufficient reserves to encircle the town underscores the manpower advantage it still has, four months after Ukraine’s mobilisation law came into force. “I confidently said that one would have to be a moron to allow our guys to be surrounded, but someone did,” wrote Stanislav Buniatov, a Ukrainian soldier and blogger, in a Telegram post. He claimed soldiers ended up withdrawing from Vuhledar in small groups, taking fire from Russian drones, and that the wounded were left “to be shot by the enemy.” The timing of this loss will also be keenly felt in Kyiv. It comes less than two months after Ukraine expanded the battlefield to Russia’s Kursk region – a move designed to ease the pressure on other fronts and help reverse Ukrainian fortunes after Russia spent the spring and summer gradually advancing in the east and opening a new front in the northern Kharkiv region. It’s also just days since Zelensky returned from a politically-charged diplomatic blitz in the US with the promise of new aid, but no NATO-style security guarantees or permission to use Western missiles in Russia. Just a week ago Zelensky told US network ABC that “we are closer to peace than we think.” The loss of Vuhledar means Ukraine now has to fight to stop Russia advancing further west, making the prospect of retaking territory even more remote. There has also been no let-up in Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, with the International Energy Agency warning that “this winter will be, by far, its sternest test yet.”"

The government’s draft budget released Monday proposes spending just under 13.5 trillion rubles (over $145 billion) on national defense. That is about three trillion rubles ($32 billion) more than was set aside for defense in 2024, which was the previous record. The Ukraine war is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides, with Ukraine getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies. Russia’s forces are bigger and better-equipped than Ukraine’s. In recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the United States last week in pursuit of continuing financial and military support as the war approaches its three-year milestone next February. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also looking at how to sustain his war effort as military spending has placed a huge strain on the Russian economy. Earlier this month, Russia’s central bank raised its key interest rate by a full percentage point to 19% to combat high inflation. It held out the prospect of more rate increases to return inflation from the current 9.1% to the bank’s target of 4% in 2025. According to the draft budget, spending on defense should decline in 2026. The proposed budget could still change as it goes through three readings in the State Duma, Russia’s lower parliament house, and then goes to the Federation Council, the upper house, before the Russian president signs it into law. Meanwhile, on Monday Putin signed a call-up order for 133,000 conscripts in the autumn military draft, which is a routine number for seasonal conscription campaigns. Vladimir Putin's nuclear warning came as Ukraine presses the United States to provide long-range weapons that would allow it to strike deep within Russia. Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik/Reuters Related article Putin revises his nuclear doctrine, but have his red lines shifted? In September, he ordered the military to increase the number of troops by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million. Overall military personnel would be about 2.4 million. Overnight, Russia fired missiles and drones at 11 regions in Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said Monday, in a 33rd consecutive night of aerial attacks behind the front line and setting a new monthly record in drone barrages. It was the first time Russians launched more than 1,000 Shahed drones in a month. It was also the first time the Iranian-made drones were used in every aerial attack on each day of the month. Drone attacks In Kyiv, multiple explosions and machine gun fire could be heard throughout the night as the Ukrainian capital’s air defenses fought off a drone attack for five hours. No casualties were reported in Kyiv or elsewhere, though a “critical infrastructure object” caught fire in the southern Mykolaiv region, Gov. Vitalii Kim said, without elaborating. Russia has increasingly deployed Shahed drones, rather than more expensive missiles, in its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. It launched more than 1,300 Shahed drones at Ukraine in September alone, the highest number of drone attacks in a single month since the war began. Ukraine, too, has developed a new generation of drones for the battlefield and for long-range strikes deep inside Russia. More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia on Sunday, Russian officials said. Also Monday, Putin released a video marking the second anniversary of the annexation of four Ukrainian territories and again accused the West of turning Ukraine into “a military base aimed at Russia.” Putin was speaking to mark the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine after a referendum held in 2022, which was denounced by the West as a sham. Russia also illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Since 2022, Putin said, businesses in the occupied areas are being “actively restored” and hospitals and schools are being rebuilt. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled from the four regions as a result of Russia’s invasion, but Putin said Russia’s military operation in the country was to defend residents’ “well-being” and the “future for our children and grandchildren.”"

Trump and Zelensky met in New York on Friday, giving the Ukrainian leader the chance to make a personal pitch to the GOP presidential nominee who is openly skeptical of continued US security assistance for Ukraine against Russia. The tensions between the two men – both of whom had been critical of the other leading up to the meeting – were obvious during a pre-meeting Q-and-A with reporters. “We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And I think if we win, we’re going to get it resolved very quickly,” Trump told reporters ahead of his meeting with Zelensky. “I hope we have more good relations between us,” Zelensky interjected. “Oh, I see,” Trump said. “It takes two to tango, you know, and we will – we’re going to have a good meeting today. And I think the fact that we’re even together today is a very good sign.” Friday’s meeting came at a pivotal moment for Zelensky ahead of November’s US election. He’s sought this week to convince the Biden administration that his country can still win the war, so long as the US and other countries significantly and quickly ramp up military assistance.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Related article Zelensky makes urgent in-person plea to Biden and Harris who highlights her contrasting approach to Trump Trump has repeatedly complained about the funding the US has provided for Ukraine and claimed he will quickly end the war between the two sides, which began with Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February 2022. Zelensky said this week that Trump doesn’t know how to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Hopefully, we’ll have a good victory, because if the other side wins, I don’t think you’re going to have victories with anything, to be honest with you,” Trump said of the race between him and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. “So, we’re going to sit down (to) just discuss it, and if we have a win, I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency – it’s January 20 – but long before that, I think that we can work out something that’s good for both sides. It’s time,” Trump added. “By the way, the president (Zelensky) knows that too. He wants to get something done. He doesn’t want to do this.” Zelensky thanked Trump for agreeing to meet with him, recalling how five years had passed since their last meeting, and said he believes they share a common view that Putin must be stopped. “I think we have common view that the war in Ukraine has to be stopped, and Putin can’t win, and Ukraine has to prevail, and I want to discuss with you the details about that,” Zelensky said. Trump says he ‘learned a lot’ but hasn’t changed his view of Russia-Ukraine war After the meeting ended, Trump and Zelensky appeared together on Fox News. Trump reiterated that he thinks a fair deal is possible and can be done quickly even as Zelensky made it clear that he feels Russian troops must be pushed all the way out of Ukraine. “I learned a lot, but I think I haven’t changed from the standpoint that we both want to see this end and we both want to see a fair deal made. And it’s got to be fair, and I think that’ll happen at the right time. I think it’s going to happen,” Trump told Fox News following the meeting. “It should stop, and the president wants it to stop. I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop, and that’s a good combination. So, we want to have a fair deal for everybody,” Trump said. When he was asked what he envisioned as “fair,” Trump said it was “too early to say that.” “I have my own ideas and I’m sure the president definitely has his own ideas. But, has to be fair,” Trump said. Zelensky chimed in reminding how Putin has invaded Ukrainian territory. “This war shouldn’t be started, and I think that the problem that Putin killed so many people and, of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war. He is in our territory. That’s the most important. He is in our territory and how to stop the war to pressure him as we can. We have to do it,” Zelensky said. Trump said Zelensky “said it the best” that “this is a war that should’ve never happened” and said another meeting between them “could very well happen.” Trump questioned how Ukraine could rebuild and restore its cities, saying “it’s not possible.” “You have to, by the way, come to see all us,” Zelensky said. “I will,” Trump said. “It’s a beautiful country.” Zelensky’s crucial – but politically awkward – meetings in the US Zelensky met at the White House on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Harris, and the Democratic nominee used the appearance to draw a stark contrast with Trump on Ukraine. “There are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality and would require Ukraine to forego security relationships with other nations,” Harris said. Zelensky’s meeting with Trump one day after visiting the White House puts him once again in the middle of a heated US political campaign – five years after Zelensky was caught up in another US domestic political firestorm. The last time Zelensky and Trump met occurred amid a Democratic impeachment investigation into Trump for denying Zelensky a White House visit and US aid to Ukraine while Trump tried to get the Ukrainians to announce an investigation into then-presidential candidate Biden. Trump would ultimately be impeached by House Democrats over pressuring Zelensky to investigate Biden. The Ukrainian president, meanwhile, finally got a meeting in the Oval Office – with Biden – in September 2021. Trump praised Zelensky – namely for being “like a piece of steel” during his first impeachment surrounding their phone call. “He could’ve grandstanded and played cute, but he didn’t do that,” Trump said. “He said, ‘President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.’ He said it loud and clear, and the impeachment hoax died right there.” GOP goes after the Ukrainian president At a rally Wednesday, Trump criticized Zelensky and claimed the Ukrainian president “refuses to make a deal” with Russia, marking the former president’s most explicit criticism of Zelensky’s handling of the war to date. “Those cities are gone, they’re gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refused to make a deal, Zelensky. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn’t have been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt,” Trump said during a campaign speech in Mint Hill, North Carolina. Trump’s Republican allies in Congress are also furious with Zelensky for his visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant along with Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro. They’ve argued his visit to the key battleground state, which is home to a sizable population of people of Ukrainian ancestry, had partisan motivations, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling on Zelensky to fire the Ukrainian ambassador to the US. Republicans have also taken issue with Zelensky calling Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the GOP vice presidential candidate, “too radical” in an interview with The New Yorker. In the same interview, Zelensky criticized Trump, saying: “My feeling is that Trump doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how. With this war, oftentimes, the deeper you look at it the less you understand.” Trump left things open-ended when asked Thursday whether he believes Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as a means of ending the war. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at Trump Tower.

There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn’t have been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt,” Trump said during a campaign speech in Mint Hill, North Carolina. The comments come at the same time as a rising furor on Capitol Hill over the Ukrainian president among Republicans. In the House, GOP lawmakers are attempting to investigate what US taxpayer resources went toward supporting Zelensky’s security as he traveled to Pennsylvania while GOP senators are warning the Ukrainian to stay out of American politics after he called Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, “too radical” in an interview that published over the weekend. The latest line of Republican attacks speaks to the broader political divisions over US involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Republican leaders are so far declining to meet Zelensky while he is in Washington, DC, while Democrats are embracing the opportunity. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson are not currently scheduled to meet with the Ukrainian president, sources told CNN, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to have meetings. It all amounts to a stark warning for the Ukrainian president, who has relied heavily on American support to fight off Russia’s invasion since it began in February 2022. While Zelensky has had strong backing from the Biden administration, Republican support for the continued funding of Ukraine’s defense has been eroding for months and now appears to be picking up speed. In New York for the United Nations General Assembly , Zelensky warned world leaders of serious attacks coming on his country, saying the Russians are set to go after Ukraine’s energy supplies – including nuclear power plants. Video Ad Feedback Zelensky warns Russia could cause a 'nuclear disaster' 04:21 - Source: CNN “Ukrainians will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past – which suits no one today – can be imposed on Ukraine now, instead of a normal, peaceful life,” he said, asking for “support from all nations of the world” in securing peace for Ukraine. Trump appeared unmoved. “Every time he came to our country, he’d walk away with $60 billion. He’s probably the greatest salesman on Earth,” Trump said of Zelensky on Wednesday. Trump says Ukraine should have given up territory to stop the war earlier In his speech, Trump blamed Biden and Harris for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and claimed they “caused this situation by the stupidity of what they said, by every move they make, but they caused the situation and now they’re locked in.” “They just don’t know what to do. They’re locked into a situation. It’s sad, they just don’t know what to do. Because Ukraine is gone, it’s not Ukraine anymore. You can never replace those cities and towns, and you can never replace the dead people, so many dead people,” Trump said. He said making a deal earlier in the conflict to cede some territory to the Russians would have prevented more catastrophe. Trump argued Biden should have been able to orchestrate a deal between Russia and Ukraine that avoided any bloodshed and argued that even a “bad deal” and one where Ukraine had “given up a little bit,” would’ve been preferable to the war. “A deal could have been made. There wouldn’t have been one person that died, and there wouldn’t have been one golden tower laying shattered on its side. A deal could have been made if we had a competent President,” Trump said. But Trump argued the opportunity to make a deal no longer existed because of the destruction Putin’s war in Ukraine had caused. “What deal can we make? What deal can we make? The, it’s, it’s demolished. The people are dead. The country is in rubble. And who are these people that allowed this to happen? Who are these people?” When asked Wednesday on a call with reporters if he believes Ukraine should cede land in exchange for ending the war, Vance said “everything is going to be on the table,” but “nothing is going to be definitely on the table.” “That’s why you have a negotiation, especially with a guy who’s as skilled as Donald Trump, is because he actually should try to have a conversation between both parties and other interested parties about how to bring this war to close,” Vance said on a call with reporters. “As he said repeatedly, the killing has to stop,” Vance added. “It’s not an America’s interest. I don’t think it’s in Ukraine or Europe’s best interest for this thing to go on indefinitely.” Vance said the “biggest problem” is how the war has “distracted and consumed a lot of resources at a time when Americans are suffering.” Vance gave a glimpse at how a Trump-Vance administration would work to end the war, telling the Shawn Ryan podcast that he believes it could involve a “demilitarized zone” at the “current line of demarcation .” House Republicans attack Zelensky House Republicans launched a new line of attack against Zelensky on Wednesday, criticizing his recent visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant ahead of key meetings with Biden and other allies as part of his weeklong push in the US to shore up more support for his war effort. Republicans are claiming that Zelensky’s visit to Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in the 2024 presidential election that is home to a sizable population of people of Ukrainian ancestry, was made to provide political support to Democrats. Johnson called on Zelensky to fire Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, for organizing the recent trip to the Pennsylvania manufacturing site. “The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote Wednesday. Meanwhile, House Oversight Chair James Comer launched an investigation into Zelensky’s use of a US aircraft to fly to the Pennsylvania facility. “The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” Comer wrote in the letter sent to the White House, the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense on Wednesday. James Adams, a Pentagon spokesperson, told CNN in a statement Thursday that the flight to Pennsylvania “was a U.S. Department of Defense-funded mission. The Department requested Military Airlift (MILAIR) support to facilitate travel for senior U.S. government officials from both the Department of State and the Department of Defense.” The statement added, “These officials were conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, which included a stop at Newark Liberty International Airport, where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania.” Senators warn Ukrainian leader to back off Vance criticisms Zelensky said in an interview with The New Yorker that Vance was “too radical” and has sent the message the Ukraine must sacrifice its territory for peace. “The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense is unacceptable. But I do not consider this concept of his a plan, in any formal sense,” Zelensky said. “This would be an awful idea, if a person were actually going to carry it out, to make Ukraine shoulder the costs of stopping the war by giving up its territories. … And it wouldn’t necessarily end the war, either. It’s just sloganeering.” Vance’s Republican colleagues in the Senate sent a clear message to the Ukrainian president when asked about the remark on Wednesday. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Republican leadership who is running to replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell next Congress, told CNN that Zelensky should “stay out of American politics,” after Zelensky called Vance “too radical.” “I think it’s a monumental miscalculation by President Zelensky,” said Cornyn. “If he wants support for Ukraine, he should stay out of American politics.” Senate Republican Whip John Thune added, “I think it would be advisable for him to stay out of American politics,” when asked if it was appropriate for Zelensky to criticize Vance. “They have some differences on some issues but it’s not his place to litigate that here in the middle of an American election.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.

The aid package, which is nearly double the size of recent shipments, includes artillery ammunition, air defense, anti-tank missiles and more of the critical weapons and equipment the US has provided Ukraine. Earlier Wednesday, President Joe Biden and other world leaders signed a Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine, promising support “in the future, in war and in peace.” The declaration comes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting the US for the United Nations General Assembly, as well as meetings with the White House. In his address to the UN , Zelensky called on the world to stand against what he called Russia’s “colonial war.” “The world has already been through colonial wars and conspiracies of great powers at the expense of those who are small,” the Ukrainian president said. “Ukrainians will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past – which suits no one today – can be imposed on Ukraine now, instead of a normal, peaceful life.” Zelensky will visit Washington, DC, on Thursday, where he will meet Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. In his meetings, Zelensky has promised to unveil his “victory plan” to defeat Russia. The plan includes Kyiv’s long-stated request to use US-manufactured long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, an ask that the Biden administration has repeatedly denied. which the Biden administration has repeatedly denied. On Wednesday, Biden promised to unveil a series of moves to support Ukraine’s military. The president said his administration is “determined to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevail in its fight for survival.” Biden is also set to announce “significant” security assistance package for Ukraine on Thursday, sources familiar told CNN, including weapons and other capabilities. The Biden administration has nearly $6 billion left in unused presidential drawdown authority that is set to expire at the end of the month. The authority allows the US to pull military arms and equipment directly from its own stockpiles to send to Ukraine. As CNN reported , the administration is expected to commit the remaining authority to Ukraine and send the aid shipments over the course of the next few months. A shortage in excess stockpiles of weapons the US was willing to send Ukraine forced the Biden administration to announce smaller military aid packages of approximately $200 million over the last several months."

The decision to change Russia’s official nuclear doctrine is the Kremlin’s answer to deliberations in the United States and Britain about whether or not to give Ukraine permission to fire conventional Western missiles into Russia. Putin, opening a meeting of Russia’s Security Council, said that the changes were in response to a swiftly changing global landscape which had thrown up new threats and risks for Russia. The 71-year-old Kremlin chief, the primary decision-maker on Russia’s vast nuclear arsenal, said he wanted to underscore one key change in particular. “It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,” Putin said. “The conditions for Russia’s transition to the use of nuclear weapons are also clearly fixed,” Putin said, adding that Moscow would consider such a move if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft or drones against it.

Putin said the clarifications were carefully calibrated and commensurate with the modern military threats facing Russia – confirmation that the nuclear doctrine was changing. Russia’s current published nuclear doctrine, set out in a 2020 decree by Putin, says Russia may use nuclear weapons in case of a nuclear attack by an enemy or a conventional attack that threatens the existence of the state. The innovations outlined by Putin include a widening of the threats under which Russia would consider a nuclear strike, the inclusion of ally Belarus under the nuclear umbrella and the idea that a rival nuclear power supporting a conventional strike on Russia would also be considered to be attacking it. The United States in 2022 was so concerned about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia that it warned Putin over the consequences of using such weapons, according to Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns. Confrontation The 2-1/2-year-old Ukraine war has triggered the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - considered to be the closest the two Cold War superpowers came to intentional nuclear war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been urging Kyiv’s allies for months to let Ukraine fire Western missiles, including long-range US ATACMS and British Storm Shadows, deep into Russia to limit Moscow’s ability to launch attacks. With Ukraine losing key towns to gradually advancing Russian forces in the country’s east, the war is entering what Russian officials say is the most dangerous phase to date. Zelensky has urged the West to cross and disregard Russia’s so-called “red lines,” and some Western allies have urged the United States to do just that, though Putin’s Russia, which controls just under one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, has warned that the West and Ukraine are risking a global war. “Russia no longer has any instruments to intimidate the world apart from nuclear blackmail,” Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, said in response to Putin’s remarks. “These instruments will not work.” Video Ad Feedback Zelensky warns Russia could cause a 'nuclear disaster' 04:21 - Source: CNN Putin, who casts the West as a decadent aggressor, and US President Joe Biden, who casts Russia as a corrupt autocracy and Putin as a killer, have both warned that a direct Russia-NATO confrontation could escalate into World War Three. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has also warned of the risk of nuclear war. Russia is the world’s largest nuclear power. Together, Russia and the US control 88% of the world’s nuclear warheads. In his remarks to Russia’s Security Council, a type of modern-day politburo of Putin’s most powerful officials including influential hawks, Putin said that work on amendments on changing the doctrine had been going on for the past year. “The nuclear triad remains the most important guarantee of ensuring the security of our state and citizens, an instrument for maintaining strategic parity and balance of power in the world,” Putin said. Russia, he said, would consider using nuclear weapons “upon receiving reliable information about the massive launch of aerospace attack vehicles and their crossing of our state border, meaning strategic or tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic and other aircraft.”"

Since Russia “can’t defeat our people’s resistance on the battlefield,” Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “looking for other ways to break the Ukrainian spirit.” For a third winter, Russia is stepping up its strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid in a bid to plunge the country into the “dark and cold,” Zelensky said. Zelensky’s address to the UN came shortly before he is set to discuss his “victory plan” with United States President Joe Biden, which is expected to include Kyiv’s long-stated request to use long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia. In his speech Zelensky recalled the “horrifying” moment in the first weeks of the war when Russian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the largest in Europe, stirred fears among Ukrainians of another Chernobyl-style disaster. “No one could know how Russian strikes on the nuclear facility would end, and everyone in Ukraine was reminded of what Chernobyl means,” he said. Two-and-a-half years later, Zelensky warned the Russian-occupied ZNPP remains “at risk of a nuclear incident.” Russia and Ukraine have blamed previous incidents at the plant on each other. Ukraine has three other nuclear plants, according to the World Nuclear Association. CNN has previously reported that the risk of a large-scale nuclear incident at the ZNPP is low, since Ukrainian operators put the plant’s reactors into a “cold shutdown” mode in June 2023. If the plant’s reactors were to be blown open, the cold reactor would “expose spent fuel to the air, which will spread some radiation,” William Alberque, Director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategy Studies, told CNN. This would create a radiation zone where “you’ll have a higher chance of cancer over the next 40 years,” but will not recreate the sort of destruction seen after the meltdown of the active Chernobyl plant in 1986. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visits the ZNPP, June 15, 2023. Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty Images While the risk of a large-scale nuclear incident is low, the threat to Ukraine’s energy system remains high. “Russia has destroyed all our thermal power plants, and a large part of our hydroelectric capacity,” Zelensky said. He said that 80% of Ukraine’s energy system had been disabled by Russia’s assaults. Absent from Zelensky’s speech, however, was reference to Ukraine’s hopes to be granted permission to use Western weapons to strike targets deep into Russia. Before traveling to the US, Zelensky told CNN that Ukraine’s request was a key part of his “victory plan.” Radek Sikorski, Poland’s Foreign Minister, told CNN it is vital that Ukraine’s request be granted. He recalled a recent incident in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where an entire family was wiped out by a Russian missile strike. “The missile that killed that family was launched from a Russian bomber flying over Russian territory from a Russian airfield. Give me one reason why Ukraine should not be able to take out that bomber and take out ﻿that airfield,” Sikorski said. “The victim of aggression has the right to defend itself also on the territory of the aggressor,” he added, saying “we are making those arguments to the US.”"

The first of the military aid packages, which is expected as soon as Wednesday, will total $375 million, according to the defense officials. From there, the value of the packages will rise sharply, with less than a week before the remainder of the authority expires. Although the packages will be announced in the near future, the shipment of weapons will be delayed because of dwindling stockpiles in the weapons and equipment that the US is willing to send Ukraine, as CNN previously reported . With days left until the Ukraine aid authority expires, the Biden administration was still looking at a way to extend the authority through the end of the year. The plan requires the administration to obligate the funds to Ukraine before they expire at the end of the month, which would then give the US more time to announce specific aid packages. “We are committed to making sure Ukraine gets the resources Congress approved before the end of the President’s term and we will have more details to provide soon,” a third defense official said. The Biden administration has nearly $6 billion left in what’s known as presidential drawdown authority to deliver arms and equipment to Ukraine before it expires at the end of the month. The Pentagon was pushing Congress to extend the authority into the next fiscal year so that it would not expire, which would give the US more flexibility in its ability to provide critical supplies to support Ukraine in its war with Russia. Congressional leaders were forced to leave the language out of the spending bill because of internal resistance from the House GOP, according to a person familiar with the matter. House Republicans remain deeply divided over funding for Ukraine. The House is expected to easily approve the stopgap spending measure Wednesday and then leave Washington until after the November election. The Senate could take up the funding measure as early as late Wednesday or early Thursday – the same day that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit the US Capitol. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the US and other countries to deliver more weapons to Ukraine and has pushed for the US to loosen its restrictions on the use of US weapons against targets deep inside Russia. On Tuesday, Zelensky told the United Nations that “Russia can only be forced into peace.” “This war can’t simply fade away, that’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks. Action is needed,” Zelensky said. CNN reported last week that the US was considering announcing large military aid packages to Ukraine that would be delivered over the course of months. In the past, military aid packages under presidential drawdown authority were often delivered within days or weeks. But with billions in military aid set to expire, the US is expected to announce large overall aid package and space out the delivery of supplies and equipment over several months, turning a short-term supply line into a longer-term commitment. “There is every intention that we want to use every dollar and cent of that authority,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a press briefing last week.

The accounts are linked to Rossiya Segodnya and TV-Novosti, the organizations behind the Sputnik news agency and the RT broadcaster respectively, the social media platform said on its website Monday, labeling the groups “state-affiliated.” The move mirrors an announcement by Meta ( META ) last week that it had banned Rossiya Segodnya, RT and “other related entities” from its apps globally for “foreign interference activity.” Rossiya Segodnya and RT did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the TikTok measure. Earlier this month, the US Justice Department announced charges against two RT employees for funneling nearly $10 million into a US company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media, to create and amplify content that aligned with Russian state interests. The covert influence campaign was aimed at the American public ahead of the presidential election, US officials said. A view shows the Kremlin in downtown Moscow on March 27.

After the Justice Department announcement, RT responded with mocking statements that did not address the specifics of the US allegations. TikTok, for its part, has itself faced questions over whether or not the Chinese government can manipulate its algorithm to influence the American public. The platform, which 170 million Americans use to watch videos about sports, fashion and politics, is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on TikTok in the United States unless the app finds a new owner, which the company has since challenged in court."

Zelensky will fully outline his “victory plan” – which includes Kyiv’s long-stated request to use long-range missiles on targets inside Russia – to Biden for the first time during the visit before sharing it with both presidential candidates, US lawmakers and international partners, he said. “This fall will determine the future of this war,” Zelensky posted on X from his plane before landing in the US. “Together with our partners, we can strengthen our positions as needed for our victory – a shared victory for a truly just peace.” Zelensky kicked off his visit at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Biden’s hometown, where he thanked workers for providing Ukraine with munitions and said the facility would ramp up production of 155mm artillery shells crucial for Kyiv’s war effort. “It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” he said. “Thanks to people like these – in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries – who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tours the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant on September 22, 2024.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet not only US President Joe Biden, who has signaled he is open to discussing the issue, but also likely both US presidential candidates on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Those meetings come as experts say the public wrangling on this topic has raised the stakes of the decision, and potentially shifted the role these missiles - the Franco-British Storm Shadow/Scalps and US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) - might play in this expanding war. It was almost exactly a year ago, also during an in-person meeting with Zelensky in the United States, that Biden made the decision to supply the ATACMS to Ukraine.

Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Related article US expected to announce major Ukraine weapons package but delay shipments due to concerns over Pentagon stockpiles The news did leak out , but official confirmation only came a month later, Zelensky burying it at the end of a nightly address on October 18. “Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented,” he said.  “And they are being implemented very accurately – ATACMS have proven themselves.” By that point the missiles had, according to US officials, already been used in several strikes on Russian-occupied Luhansk and the southern coastal town of Berdiansk. A few months earlier, a similar story played out with the British Storm Shadows when then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace only confirmed they had been supplied once they were already in use. In both cases, Ukraine promised not to use them on Russian territory. This September, Zelensky is employing a strategy of more openly challenging his allies, and that, combined with Russia’s open threats that any lifting of restrictions on their use would mean war with NATO, has turned the issue of firing these missiles into Russia into a political touchstone, an ultimate determinant of the extent of Western support. Zelensky has refused to allow the topic to fall out of the headlines - publicly criticizing his allies’ hesitation after a Russian strike on a military educational facility in Poltava killed  more than 50 people earlier this month. “Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he said. Last weekend, after a Russian bomb attack on an apartment block in Kharkiv, he even made veiled accusations of cowardice, saying: “This terror can be stopped. But to stop it, the fear of making strong, objectively necessary decisions must be overcome.” “Zelensky has taken a bit of a risk on this,” said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. “He’s almost playing political chicken. He’s kind of daring people to support him.” If it happens though, the political dividend would be significant, says Savill, blunting Russian rhetoric and “demonstrating firm international support” for Ukraine. As for the battlefield dividend, that, experts say, is less clear cut. Opinion is divided on the extent to which the public debate around the missile permissions has blunted their potential utility - especially when it comes to targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure. US intelligence believes 90% of Russian aircraft that launch deadly glide bombs (at least 100 per day, according to Zelensky), are more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, so outside of ATACMS range. And that number may be increasing. Russia recently relocated planes from two bases near the border further east, according to one US official. Savill agrees “lots of the juiciest targets” have likely been moved deeper into Russian territory, meaning the impact on the war may be “limited.” But that doesn’t mean the missiles have no utility. Storm Shadows, designed to penetrate deep into concrete, could be effective against military headquarters, or ammunition stores, many of which are still in range.  ATACMS, some of which have cluster warheads, could be used to do significant damage to airfields. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think-tank in Washington DC, has calculated that 15 Russian airfields are in range of ATACMs (though it’s not clear how many aircraft are still housed on them). George Barros, the author of that ISW research, agrees a less public debate may have been preferable, but if the very prospect of these permissions being granted has forced Russia to move aircraft further from the border, it’s a good thing. It could reduce the number of bombing missions Russian planes can make (known in the military as the “sortie rate”) and buy Ukraine valuable detection and reaction time for incoming attacks. An early version of an Army Tactical Missile System is tested December 14, 2021, at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. John Hamilton/US Army More importantly, he believes that if Ukraine could strike Russian troops, weaponry and logistics within the 300-kilometer range of the top-end ATACMS, it would for the first time force Russia to calculate the risks of moving large amounts of troops and equipment into Ukraine. “You’ve only just now … started talking about a potential risk to Russia’s rear area and depriving them of this insane luxury that the Russian command has leveraged. To really bring mass (equipment), to get 10 to one artillery ratios on Ukraine at the frontline,” he told CNN. Barros’ research has pinpointed at least 200 potential targets that would be in range of ATACMs, ranging from military regiments to fuel depots, weapons storage depots, and even the headquarters of Russia’s Southern Military district in Rostov (all of which would be much harder to move than aircraft). The list is also conservative, Barros acknowledges, and has not accounted for new targets installed after the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.  And some of the newest targets of all could, according to Savill, include Iranian FATH-360 ballistic missiles, which the US believes have already been supplied and have a range of just 75 kilometers (47 miles), far less than the Western missiles. Experts also agree the missiles could provide valuable support to Ukraine’s drone and ground operations. Savill believes ATACMS could do serious damage to Russian air defense radars and systems, adding that “if you punch a hole through, actually Ukrainian long-range drones have got better options to penetrate deeper into Russia.” Hitting Russian air defense systems in the border areas could also improve Ukraine’s chances of retaking its own territory, said Barros.

There’s also the option in theory, Savill said, to extend the range of the missiles by launching from Ukrainian positions inside Kursk, though that could put Ukrainian bombers and missile launchers in the crosshairs of Russian air defenses. Ultimately, Ukraine continues to argue that the ability to use Western-supplied long-range missiles inside Russia is part of the complex jigsaw puzzle of ending this war on Kyiv’s terms — and a way to show Russia it cannot outlast Ukraine’s allies. Zelensky is heading to the US on the one hand buoyed by the Kursk offensive providing fresh evidence of both Ukrainian ingenuity and, he argues, the flimsiness of Russian “red lines,” but on the other hand motivated by the prospect of a third winter with critical electricity shortages, and still inadequate supplies of equipment and manpower. “We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine, but also on Russian territory,” he told a large gathering of Ukraine’s allies at the US’ Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany earlier this month, “so Russia is motivated to seek peace.”"

Zelensky is expected to visit the US next week, taking part at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. On Sunday, he is expected to visit a Scranton, Pennsylvania, ammunition factory that produces critical munitions his country is using in its fight against Russia, a source familiar with the plans said. Zelensky is expected to make a stop at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, which makes the 155 millimeter artillery shells that have been part of Ukraine’s war efforts. The Associated Press was first to report on the plans. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian government for comment but it would not disclose his travel plans for security reasons. Ammunition depots hit Ukrainian officials meanwhile said on Saturday that they struck two ammunition facilities in Russia’s Krasnodar and Tver regions, part of continued efforts to degrade Russian military infrastructure. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on Saturday, that the Tikhoretsk arsenal in Russia’s Krasnodar region was targeted overnight in a joint operation with country’s Security Service (SBU), claiming that the facility is “one of the three largest ammunition storage bases of the occupiers and is one of the key facilities in the logistics system of the Russian troops.” In a post on Telegram overnight, Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratiev acknowledged what he said was a “terrorist attack by the Kyiv regime,” but did not mention any ammunition depot being hit. He said that two drones were intercepted with its falling debris causing a fire, leading to the temporary evacuation of nearby settlements. A second facility, allegedly used to store Iskander tactical missile systems and Tochka-U tactical missile systems, was also hit overnight further inside Russia, near the village of Oktyabrskiy, Tver region, a Ukrainian security source familiar with the situation told CNN on Saturday. “The SBU, jointly with the entire Ukrainian Defense Forces, is systematically reducing the enemy’s missile and artillery potential,” the source said. On Wednesday, Ukraine claimed it destroyed a large Russian ammunition depot in the western Russian region of Tver. “Today, it was the next largest depot - one of the enemy’s important logistics facilities where ammunition was stored for attacks on Ukraine” said the source,” the source added on Saturday. CNN cannot confirm the Ukrainian claims and Russian authorities have not commented on ammunition depots being hit overnight. CNN’s Darya Tarasova contributed to this report."

The US currently has $5.9 billion left in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine, the Pentagon said this week, which is set to expire at the end of the fiscal year in less than two weeks. That authority allows the Pentagon to pull inventories directly from American stockpiles to send to Ukraine, and it is how the US has supplied much of the arms and equipment it has provided to Kyiv. The weapons package, which will likely include artillery, air defenses and other munitions critical to the fight, is expected to be significantly larger than recent announcements, which have hovered around $200 million for the last several months. CNN reported earlier this week that the US was providing Ukraine with smaller military aid packages as the stockpiles of weapons and equipment that the Pentagon is willing to send Kyiv from its own inventory have dwindled. But faced with the possibility of the funds expiring, the US may now take a different approach, announcing large military aid packages that will take months to deliver. The Defense Department has urged Congress to grant an extension on the use of the funds. But those prospects rapidly faded when the House of Representatives failed to pass a continuing resolution on Wednesday. “There is every intention that we want to use every dollar and cent of that authority,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a press briefing Thursday. Presidential drawdown packages were initially intended as a way of supplying Ukraine with arms and equipment in the short-term since the start of the war with Russia. Some packages began arriving in Ukraine within days of their announcement, allowing the US to quickly flow weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian military in the middle of war. More sophisticated equipment with long production times was sent through another mechanism – the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative – that purchased weapons directly from arms manufacturers for future delivery. Facing the prospect of billions in available drawdown authority expiring, the Biden administration has changed it from a short-term supply of weapons to a longer-term commitment, permitting the US to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine well into the next year at the current pace of deliveries. The US believes Ukraine will need at least $500 million worth of presidential drawdown authority per month through fiscal year 2025, according to a senior administration official. The US is also considering allocating $10 billion worth of revenues from seized Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine, which the G7 agreed to use toward Ukraine security assistance over the summer, according to the senior administration official. Western nations froze almost $300 billion of Russian assets in bank accounts in Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022."

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the loan Friday in a post on X as part of her visit to Kyiv. “Relentless Russian attacks means Ukraine needs continued EU support,” she wrote, adding that the loan was part of “the G7 pledge.” “We are now confident that we can deliver this loan to Ukraine very quickly,” she later said at a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, telling him: “You will decide how best to use the funds… And this will free more of your national resources to strengthen then, for example, your military capabilities and to defend yourself against the Russian aggression.” The funds are expected to be delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year. In June, the Group of Seven, which brings together some of the world’s largest economies, agreed to collectively loan about $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the EU and elsewhere as collateral. Western nations froze Russia’s assets in bank accounts located in Europe, the United States and other countries as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Around two-thirds of Russia’s frozen assets, or some €210 billion ($234 billion), sits in the EU, while just $3 billion is located in US banks.

The announcement sends “a clear signal that the burden of rebuilding Ukraine will be shouldered by those responsible for its destruction,” it added. The funding mechanism stops short of seizing the frozen Russian assets outright. The EU has been worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Von der Leyen’s visit to Kyiv comes just as the winter heating season starts in Ukraine. Russia’s bombardments targeted at the country’s energy infrastructure have intensified in recent months, leaving Ukrainians vulnerable to power outages. On Thursday, the International Energy Agency said this coming winter will be the “sternest test yet” for Ukraine’s energy system."

Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with missiles and drones since its full-scale invasion in February 2022, but its bombardments have intensified recently, leaving the country in a precarious position as colder weather approaches. “Ukraine’s energy system has made it through the past two winters thanks to the resilience, courage and ingenuity of its people and strong solidarity from its international partners,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement Thursday. “But this winter will be, by far, its sternest test yet.” Last month, Russia launched one of its largest aerial attacks on Ukraine since the start of the war, firing more than 200 missiles and drones mainly at energy infrastructure. The onslaught caused power outages in several Ukrainian cities, affecting millions of households. Ukraine has also attacked Russia’s energy infrastructure . Even before that attack by Moscow, more than two-thirds of Ukraine’s pre-war power generation capacity was offline because it had been destroyed, damaged or occupied by Russian forces, the IEA said in a report. That has made rolling blackouts, which can also affect water supply, a feature of daily life in Ukraine. CNN has gained an exclusive access to a medical evacuation train that is used by Ukraine’s Armed Forces to transport wounded soldiers from near the frontlines to hospitals across the country.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN Related article On board a lifesaving hospital train bringing Ukraine’s wounded soldiers to safety “The situation could become even more dire as the days get shorter and colder,” the agency cautioned. “A yawning gap between available electricity supply and peak demand risks emerging — bringing the threat of even more severe disruptions to hospitals, schools and other key institutions in the depths of winter.” The IEA estimates that Ukraine’s electricity supply shortfall could reach as much as 6 gigawatts this winter, or almost a third of expected peak demand and equivalent to the peak annual demand of Denmark, for example. In its report, the agency outlines 10 measures that Ukraine and its allies should implement to tackle risks to the country’s energy supply. These include bolstering the physical and cyber security of critical energy infrastructure, expediting delivery of equipment and spare parts for repairs, investing in energy efficiency and increasing the capacity to import electricity and natural gas from the European Union. But, according to the report, effective air defense is “by far the most important” measure to safeguard the minimum level of energy services in Ukraine through the coming months. Help from frozen Russian assets To help Ukraine through the upcoming winter, the EU will disburse €160 million ($179 million) — including €60 million ($67 million) in humanitarian aid for shelters and heaters, and €100 million ($112 million) for repair works and renewable energy, with the larger amount flowing from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets . “It is only right that Russia pays for the destruction it caused,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters Thursday. She also noted that the EU had contributed at least €2 billion ($2.2 billion) toward Ukraine’s energy system since Russia’s full-scale invasion began. Work currently underway to repair Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and connect its electricity grid to the rest of Europe will cover more than 25% of the country’s energy needs this winter, according to the president of the EU’s executive arm. In one example of such efforts, a thermal power plant in Lithuania is being dismantled and shipped to Ukraine where it will be reassembled. The EU has also dispatched solar panels to 21 hospitals in the country, eight of which will be “fully equipped” by the winter, she said."

The Ukrainian drones targeted the Russian defense ministry-operated warehouse in the city of Toropets, which was storing Iskander tactical missile systems, Tochka-U tactical missile systems, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, the source said. Large fires broke out from the debris of drones repelled by local air defenses, the regional government said, prompting the governor, Igor Rudenya, to order a partial evacuation of the area during the early hours of Wednesday. Earthquake monitors now believe explosions from the drone attack may have generated seismic activity. Ben Dando, a seismologist at the Norwegian seismology research foundation NORSAR, told CNN that its sensors “detected seismic signals, of magnitude 2.5 to 2.8, in northwest Russia which look to be associated with the drone attack launched by Ukraine.” NORSAR, which has been using seismic monitors since 2022 to evaluate the impact of the war in Ukraine, is currently analyzing the preliminary data to capture the full extent of the blast, Dando added.

Ukraine has been pushing its key allies, including the United States, to give the go-ahead to carry out missile strikes on targets deeper into Russian territory.

Duct tape can be seen around the wrists of one of his blood-stained arms. The words “for Kursk” are written in Cyrillic on the sword, in seeming reference to Ukraine’s cross-border attack on the Kursk region, the first foreign invasion of Russian territory since World War II. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said on Tuesday that the image showed “another act of barbarism” by Russia. His office later confirmed it had opened a criminal investigation into the alleged execution.

The shift comes amid concerns ...","Sep 17, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Natasha Bertrand,Ukraine,"CNN — US military aid packages for Ukraine have been smaller in recent months, as the stockpiles of weapons and equipment that the Pentagon is willing to send Kyiv from its own inventory have dwindled. The shift comes amid concerns about US military readiness being impacted as US arms manufacturers play catchup to the huge demand created by the war against Russia . The shortage means the Biden administration still has $6 billion in funds available to arm and equip Ukraine, but the Pentagon lacks the inventory it is willing to deliver more than two years into the war, two US officials told CNN. “It’s about the stockpiles we have on our shelves, what [the Ukrainians] are asking for, and whether we can meet those requests with what we currently have” without impacting readiness, one of the officials said. The Pentagon has asked Congress for more time to spend that money before it expires at the end of September, according to Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. It’s a stark reversal from last winter, when the administration was pleading with lawmakers for additional funding to support Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. “Replenishment is also an issue,” the official said. The US is ramping up production of key items, such as 155 mm ammunition and Patriot missile systems, both to supply Ukraine and to refill US inventories. But it is a yearslong process that won’t quickly meet the surging demand. Before the war in Ukraine, the US produced approximately 15,000 155 mm artillery shells each month. With new factories and production lines opening, the US is now producing 40,000 shells a month. But it will still take more than a year for the Pentagon to hit its goal of 100,000 shells each month. The process of ramping up production is on schedule, but the process will take years, requiring new facilities, expanded factories and Congress willing to allocate the money. Ukraine is feeling the impact of the inventory shortages, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. During a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany this month, Zelensky told the US and other allies that deliveries of promised air defense systems were moving too slowly and warned of a “significant” shortfall in vital aid. In April, Congress gave the Biden administration an additional $13.4 billion to use specifically to send Ukraine weapons and equipment drawn from US stockpiles. But the Defense Department hasn’t been able to use it all because of a lack of corresponding supply that it is willing to part with without risking the US’ own readiness, officials told CNN. The Pentagon announced in April that it would send up to $1 billion worth of weapons and equipment directly from US stockpiles to Kyiv after Congress finally passed a supplemental funding package for Ukraine. Since then, however, the value of each military aid package to Ukraine has been significantly smaller, with none exceeding $400 million and most in the $125 million to $250 million range. In 2022 and 2023, the Pentagon regularly announced packages worth between $600 million to $800 million, with the highest being $2.85 billion in January 2023. Another US official noted the administration was unable to draw supplies from Defense Department stockpiles for the first four months of the year because of Congress’ delay in approving supplemental funding. The official also said the US is trying not to send Ukraine too much at once. “There are limits to how quickly we can draw down equipment without impacting military readiness, which is one reason packages get spaced out,” the official said. There are also limits, the official added, to how quickly Ukraine can absorb the equipment and distribute it effectively. The US is still trying to announce a new aid package roughly every two weeks, the official added, which Ukraine is “supportive of because they believe getting new packages every two weeks is a morale boost.” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has vowed to continue providing military support to Ukraine and announced a new $250 million aid package at the meeting in Germany this month. Austin acknowledged at the meeting that the US is working to ramp up production and “speed up deliveries” to Ukraine. “Time is of the essence, especially with winter on its way,” Austin said. “And we must all step up our support — and quickly.”"
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/world/analysis-ryan-routh-ukraine-propaganda-russia-intl-latam/index.html,"Ryan Routh’s support for Ukraine is a propaganda win for Moscow, at a very tricky time for Kyiv",Moscow’s prolific echo chambers are trying to fashion a narrative in which US support for Ukraine is somehow extremist.,"Sep 17, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Nick Paton Walsh,Ukraine,"London CNN — It is exactly the kind of attention Ukraine did not need. Since the start of clashes with Russia over its future in 2003, Ukraine has carefully avoided the sort of political violence Ryan Wesley Routh is accused of. Yet now, at arguably the most crucial point of the conflict, Routh’s vocal support for Kyiv has somehow been seized upon by Russian echo chambers after he was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump. Someone like Routh was quite easy to meet in Ukraine in the opening months of Russia’s full-scale war in 2022. Border crossings and railway stations were often haunted by whispering, unshaven expatriates of questionable military provenance, trying to conjure the idea that the very real and painful struggle of Ukraine was something they had a pivotal role in. As the conflict has dragged on, the fantasists have faded, and the resumes of dozens of Western volunteers been vetted, or become less relevant as their alleged experience has been tested in combat. The most brutal fighting Europe has seen since the 1940s, the Ukrainian front line has never been less of a place for amateur thrill-seekers. Yet Routh tried his best to associate himself with the fight against Russia, expressing support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts that year, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “ we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground .” Ryan Wesley Routh (center), who was detained by US authorities on Sunday after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. GoFundMe Related article What we know about Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent second Trump assassination attempt He protested in Kyiv after Russia invaded, and even tried to enlist, but, aged 56 with no military experience, was turned away. He tried to help recruit foreigners to fight but seems to have failed. The New York Times even interviewed him about a plan to obtain fake passports so Afghan veterans could come from Pakistan or Iran to Ukraine to help resist Russia’s onslaught. His offers to recruit large numbers to fight for Ukraine from across the world “were not realistic” said Oleksandr Shaguri, an officer of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Land Forces Command. He told CNN, “The best way to describe [Routh’s] messages is – delusional ideas.” Routh never worked with them – a common refrain from across Ukraine’s military heard Monday. Kyiv has enough on its plate now, other than explaining how little it had to do with the author of “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen – Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” This – Routh’s title for his self-published book – does not demand its author ’ s ideas are taken too seriously. But already, Moscow’s prolific echo chambers have begun to fashion a narrative in which US support for Ukraine is somehow extremist. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, asked what he thought about the assassination bid, said, according to Reuters: “It is not us who should be thinking, it is the US intelligence services who should be thinking. In any case, playing with fire has its consequences.” RT.com, a Kremlin-run English news outlet, also highlighted Routh’s interest in Ukraine, writing that “Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene stated that if the suspect’s identity is confirmed, it is clear he is ‘obsessed with the Ukraine war, which is funded by the US.’” Do not expect any majorly new or intelligent arguments to surface about the war in Ukraine in the weeks ahead. But instead, anticipate a slow drip of some new voices, and some of the usual, suggesting the war in Ukraine cannot be won, that Putin must be given a chance to negotiate a deal (even one that lets him keep the chunk of Ukraine he has stolen), and that there is an unhealthy infection of extremists in the ranks of those who feel they must – as Routh once said – “fight and die” for Ukraine. People stand near the sports complex of a university after Russian missile attacks in Kyiv, Ukraine, on September 2. Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto/AP None of this helps Ukrainians who genuinely must fight and die to protect their homes and families. It particularly hampers Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, days before he is set to present a victory plan to the Biden administration. The clamor of support for Ukraine to receive US permission to fire longer-range US-supplied missiles at targets deeper inside Russian territory had been growing. It seemed likely last week that President Joe Biden would follow the course he’s taken when past decisions on arming Ukraine were presented to him, and consent – albeit very, very late – after public pressure from allies. But now Zelensky’s press appearances may be dogged by questions about Routh, however absurdly distant from Kyiv’s agenda his apparent attack on a Florida golf course was. It will feed into the ultimate paranoia of US isolationists: that actions overseas which appear to benefit America’s global interests carry with them the risk of fomenting violence back home. Routh’s political leanings and worldview were far from consistent, if not delusional. But in the breathy forum of random gibberish that is social media, they contribute to a narrative, for those who seek it, of support for Ukraine causing chaos in America. That the United States should just stay out of Putin’s war. None of it connects with the savage reality Ukrainians face every night, shaken awake by Russian missiles, or losing loved ones to the ghastly attrition of the front lines. Washington’s support for Kyiv is weighty and consequential when it lumbers into play, yet horrifyingly fragile when subjected to US electoral politics and the Republican party’s fickle grip on geopolitics. The sudden insertion of a wayward extremist like Routh is a loud, confusing wild card, at a time when support for Ukraine urgently needed a calm and balanced voice."

The increase would take the overall number of Russian military personnel to nearly 2.4 million, including 1.5 million troops, according to the decree published by the Kremlin Monday. The new staffing will come into effect in December, it said. Putin’s decree comes after Ukraine last month launched a lightning attack across the border on Russia’s southern Kursk region – the first foreign invasion of Russian territory since World War II. Last week, Russia stepped up its efforts to expel Ukrainian troops from Kursk and is inching forward toward the crucial Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk in the eastern Donbas region. Since 2022, Putin has ordered two previous expansions in the number of combat troops, in addition to a mobilization of military reservists and conscripts. In August 2022, Putin ordered an increase of 137,000 troops by the start of the new year, which put the military’s staffing at just over 2 million personnel, including 1.15 million troops.

Andrii Marienko/AP Related article Russian strike hits apartment block in Ukraine’s Kharkiv, killing one person and injuring at least 40 The next month, after a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive that liberated most of the eastern Kharkiv region, Putin ordered the immediate “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens. The mobilization meant citizens with military experience were subject to conscription and that military reservists could be called up. The mobilization prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country – many to neighboring Georgia and other formerly communist countries near Russia’s border – and sparked angry demonstrations, particularly in Russia’s ethnic minority regions that have borne the brunt of previous recruitment drives. The mobilization was suspended in November 2023 after officials said the target of recruiting 300,000 personnel had been met. Then in December, Putin ordered another official expansion of 170,000 troops , bringing the total to 1.32 million. Russia’s casualty numbers remain shrouded in secrecy. In September 2022, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said 5,937 troops had been killed in the war. The ministry has not published an update since. Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. In an update published this month, the General Staff of Ukraine’s military said Russia has lost 616,300 troops. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense also estimates that Russia has suffered more than 610,000 casualties. “Russia’s casualty rate will likely continue to average above 1,000 a day throughout September 2024 as Russia continues operations on a wide front from Kursk in the north to Robotyne in the south,” it said."

Ukraine launched its assault last month, capturing scores of settlements, a move that stunned even Kyiv’s allies. But from the beginning observers have said it was unlikely that it would be able to hold on to its gains. Geolocated video shows that Russian units have retaken a couple of villages, but the situation remains fluid. Both the quality and number of Russian troops committed to the region are hazy, and reliable frontline accounts are few and far between. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the start of Russia’s counteoffensive and says it intends to deploy 60,000 – 70,000 troops in the Kursk region. But he said Friday that the Russians “have not yet had any serious success. Our heroic soldiers are holding on.” The US has assessed that Russia would need up to 20 brigades – about 50,000 men – to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk, but Defense Department spokesman Major Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that Russian actions so far were “marginal” and analysts have not seen the sort of mass or quality that would quickly drive out the much smaller Ukrainian force. Some high-caliber units do appear to be involved in the Russian counter-offensive geolocated video showed elements of the elite 51st Airborne Regiment involved in an assault on Thursday. But the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assesses that little of the Russian grouping in Kursk “is comprised of combat experienced units.” Initial indications are that Russian forces may try to cut off Ukrainian troops near the town of Korenevo before beginning a larger-scale counteroffensive operation. A Ukrainian officer taking part in the Kursk operation told CNN Friday that the Russians had taken about two kilometers (an assessment shared by Russian military bloggers) on the western edge of the zone seized by the Ukrainians last month. The officer said poor communications were hampering their operations. An armed Ukrainian soldier stands on the street on September 10, 2024 in Sudzha, Kursk Region, Russia. Oleg Palchyk/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images Video surfaced of the Russian flag – and incidentally, the flag of the Wagner private military company – being raised in the village of Snahost. But the officer said the situation had stabilized and there was fierce fighting in another nearby village. There are also signs that Ukrainian units may be developing a new assault route into a different part of Kursk, near the town of Veseloe. This might be intended to distract Russian forces. “By launching surprise offensives across the thinly defended border, Ukraine can pursue operational-level guerrilla warfare to support an overall strategy of exhaustion,” says Robert Rose of the Modern War Institute at West Point. Despite the gathering Russian counterattack in Kursk, and mounting Ukrainian losses, Zelensky insists the incursion into Kursk is necessary and valuable, and has slowed Russian advances in eastern Donetsk, where the city of Pokrovsk is under immediate threat. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is seeking to fully capture four eastern Ukrainian regions he already partly controls, and most of the fighting in the war has focused on this area.

REUTERS/Viacheslav Ratynskyi/File Photo Viacheslav Ratynskyi/Reuters Related article Ukraine’s Kursk offensive was seen as a major success, but it came at a huge cost Zelensky told a panel in Kyiv Friday moderated by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that Russia’s advantage in artillery ammunition in the Pokrovsk area had been cut from 12-to-1 to 2.5-to-1, which he attributed to the success of the Kursk campaign. “The speed [of the Russian advance] in the Donetsk sector was even faster before the Kursk operation. And not only in Donetsk [sector], but in the whole of the east,” Zelensky said. While Russian momentum slowed in the first week of September, no significant units were withdrawn to fight in Kursk, although some were redeployed from less contested areas along the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) front line. The Kremlin appears to prioritize the goal of progress in Donetsk over retrieving lost Russian territory – for now. The Ukrainians have offered several reasons for the Kursk operation – that it would force Russia to redeploy troops currently committed on the front-lines in Ukraine; that it would provide Ukraine with land to trade in any negotiations; that it would make a mockery of Putin’s ‘red lines’; and that it would provide a pool of prisoners-of-war to exchange (which it already has.) Zelensky claims that the Kursk operation has shown Putin’s warnings about the consequences of escalation to be hollow. Zelensky has now added another justification for the Kursk offensive: that it forestalled a Russian plan to take a large swathe of northern Ukraine as a buffer zone, a plan that would have swallowed “regional centers.” He told the Kyiv panel that “information from our partners” indicated that the Russians intended to create “security zones” deep inside Ukraine. The ISW, a think-tank in Washington DC, said Friday that the Russian military command may have intended “additional offensive operations along a wider and more continuous front in northeastern Ukraine to significantly stretch Ukrainian forces.” For now, such Russian ambitions are on hold. They still hold the advantage in firepower and men along most of the existing frontlines and will continue to use the tactic of intense bombardment - followed by infantry advances through the ruins of what has been destroyed - as a way of grinding down the enemy. The Ukrainians have several immediate priorities: creating and strengthening defensive lines in the east and accelerating the formation of new units. They are developing longer-range strike capabilities to degrade Russian infrastructure such as airfields and fuel depots. And they are demanding greater freedom to use precision western missiles in strikes deep inside Russian territory.

Tatyana Makeyeva/AFP/Getty Images Zelensky told Fareed Zakaria Friday that Russia’s guided aerial bombs , known as FABs, were responsible for 80% of destroyed infrastructure – and Ukraine urgently needed to hit the airfields from which they are launched. This appeal appears to be gaining traction. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at his meeting Friday with US President Joe Biden that “the next few weeks and months could be crucial – very, very important that we support Ukraine in this vital war of freedom.” But the Biden Administration is wary of the consequences of what the Kremlin sees as an escalation that would bring NATO directly into the conflict. The Kursk incursion may encourage Ukraine to develop another tool that “could fundamentally change Ukraine’s approach to fighting,” according to Rose at the Modern War Institute. “Ukraine cannot use manoeuvre to achieve a decisive victory over Russia. What it can do is use manoeuvre to exploit vulnerabilities, force Russia to over-extend, create chaos, encircle Russian forces, and capture Russian equipment.” The crux, according to Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven Associate Professor of National Security, is how Ukraine changes Putin’s decision-making, whether in Kursk or by much deeper strikes inside Russia, or both. “Does it make him negotiate? Does it cause him to pull back or pause in Donetsk?” Kursk may have succeeded in persuading Biden and other western allies to approve deeper strikes, Schmidt says - and “If follow-on attacks can sustain the war deep inside Russia, so it affects Russians and then affects the Kremlin’s decision making.” That would define it as a success. But we need to ask the bigger question, as the US eventually did in Iraq, says Schmidt. “How does this end?”"

Putin’s comments come as US and NATO allied partners appear increasingly open to the possibility of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided long-range weapons systems to strike at Russian military targets, something which Kyiv has openly pressed for as the war continues deep into its second year. During a recent visit to Kyiv, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered the strongest suggestion yet the White House was considering lifting restrictions in line with a broader strategic shift among NATO partners. “From day one, as you heard me say, we have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed, and I have no doubt that we’ll continue to do that as this evolves,” Blinken said, while speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, arrived in Washington Friday for talks with US President Joe Biden that are expected to center on the use of Western weapons against targets in Russia. Although the US has adjusted its policy to allow limited cross-border strikes into Russia using US-provided weapons, US President Joe Biden has yet to approve the use of longer-range systems. US officials have previously expressed concerns that allowing Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia could escalate the conflict. Before those discussions, Russia’s security service, the FSB, revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats in Moscow and accused them of spying, without providing evidence. Britain later said the expulsion occurred last month and called the accusations “completely baseless.” Biden is facing pressure at home from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to ease the restrictions as Ukraine struggles to consolidate battlefield advances and risks being pinned back by Russian forces. On Tuesday, the bipartisan congressional Ukraine caucus called on Biden to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with the long-range weapons. A group of key House Republicans also wrote to the president this week ahead of Blinken’s Ukraine trip, echoing appeals from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to lift the restrictions. But Putin on Thursday raised doubts as to whether Kyiv could carry out long-range strikes alone, saying “the Ukrainian army is not capable of using cutting-edge high-precision long-range systems supplied by the West” without NATO assistance in targeting. The US military already does provide intelligence to Ukraine, and has previously assisted in the targeting , although not with the long-range systems currently being considered. According to Center for a New American Security Senior Fellow Dr. Stacie Pettyjohn, there may also be other intelligence resources available to Ukrainian forces, including commercial satellite imagery, depending on the target. Satellite images show destroyed Russian jets at Belbek Airbase in occupied Crimea on May 15, 2024. Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies In a Thursday news conference Blinken reiterated that, as part of continuing military assistance to Ukraine, the US provides intelligence to Ukrainian forces, but declined to answer whether the US would increase its intelligence sharing. Asked about the concerns of escalation, Blinken said Wednesday that they are one factor, but “certainly not the only factor, and it’s not necessarily a dispositive factor.” He also accused Russia of escalation with its acquisition of Iranian ballistic missiles. “We’ve now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine, so if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,” said Blinken. On Friday, United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric warned of “increasing rhetoric” around nuclear weapons, after the Russian ambassador to the United Nations echoed Putin’s comments and invoked Russia’s nuclear capabilities. Speaking in the UN Security Council on Friday, Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya warned: “The facts are that NATO will be a direct party to hostilities against a nuclear power. I think you shouldn’t forget about this and think about the consequences.” The US first provided Ukraine with long-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, which have a maximum range of about 180 miles (290 kilometers), in October of 2023. Kyiv has long called on its Western backers to allow the use of weapons systems that would provide a longer reach inside Russian territory. In an recent interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that airfields Russia uses to hit Ukrainian cities are within the range of deep strikes. To date, Ukraine has used its existing supply of long-range ATACMS to target high-value Russian assets in occupied Crimea, including air defenses, ammo depots and airfields. If NATO countries move forward with authorizing the use of Western weapons for long-range strikes inside Russian territory, this technology could also be used to target close-range ballistic missile (CRBM) systems that arrived in-country from Iran in recent weeks, former US ambassador William Courtney, now an adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told CNN. With a range of just 75 miles, a US-made system like ATACMS “could hit anything at that distance and well beyond,” he told CNN. This story has been updated with additional details.

Ahead of the meeting, US officials said they did not expect Biden would immediately sign-off on allowing US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems — known as ATACMS — to be launched on targets inside Russia far from the Ukrainian border. But like the US, the United Kingdom has sent its own long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Kyiv. Their use, along with use of similar weapons from France, is currently limited to within Ukraine, and any change will require US sign-off — a matter for discussion at Friday’s talks. The president has long resisted calls from Ukrainian officials to ease restrictions on the weapons. But as the war grinds on, and as the US watches with growing concern as Iran supplies Russia with ballistic missiles, intensive discussions have been underway at the White House about a potential change. “We’re working that out right now,” Biden said when questioned this week whether he would permit Western-provided long-range missiles to target military sites like airfields, missile launchers, fuel tanks and ammunition depots inside Russia. The New York Times , citing European officials, reported that Biden appears to be on the verge of clearing the way for Ukraine to use long-range missiles as long as it doesn’t use arms provided by the US. Within the Biden administration, the debate has pitted some officials who support loosening the restrictions against others who appear more skeptical, wary both for the risk of escalation and the usefulness of such a move. Some assessments show Russia has already moved its assets – particularly launch points for glide bombs, currently the biggest threat to Ukrainian troops in the Kursk border region – out of range of the long-range missiles. On the eve of Biden’s meeting with the prime minister, US officials continued to insist that no change in policy was expected to be announced this week on Ukraine’s use of ATACMS. In light of growing public pressure to allow American-provided long-range missiles to be launched deeper into Russia, senior administration officials have stressed that the US does not believe that such a change would help change the overall course of the war. And while US officials have had ongoing discussions about the use of long-range missiles by Ukraine with both their Ukrainian and UK counterparts, American officials said the topic was not poised to take up the majority of Friday’s Biden-Starmer meeting – despite high interest in the topic in recent days. The two leaders were eager to discuss a “wealth of issues” as Starmer was beginning to get settled into the job, one US official said. The National Security Council on Thursday declined to comment on whether Biden was preparing to give a thumbs-up to the use of the UK’s Storm Shadow missiles far inside Russian territory. For Starmer, who was elected as part of his Labour Party’s landslide general election victory in early July, the meeting is an opportunity to further develop an important global relationship. He and Biden also met on the margins of a NATO summit in Washington over the summer. That meeting took place one week after Starmer’s election as prime minister and two weeks before Biden would exit the race for re-election. Starmer, people familiar with the matter said, requested another face-to-face with Biden before he left office in a bid to forge ties between the two nations, with questions looming about what the special relationship could look like after November’s US election. No announcements are expected to come out of the talks, people familiar with the matter said, and officials have said policy changes on the US weapons are not imminent. Still, that the conversation over long-range weapons is happening at all is an indication of how stalled battlefield dynamics are causing western leaders to rethink their approach. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Thursday that allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike Russia is a matter of deciding whether NATO countries are going to become directly involved in the military conflict. If Western nations decide to allow Ukraine to use their long-range weapons, Putin said: “This will mean that NATO countries – the United States and European countries – are at war with Russia.” The top American and British diplomats traveled to Kyiv this week and heard renewed pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to allow his military to fire long-range weapons on Russian military sites. American officials argue they constantly reevaluate their approach based on battlefield conditions. Although the US has shifted its policy to allow limited cross-border strikes into Russia using US-provided weapons, the administration has yet to allow longer-range strikes. Asked about the concerns of escalation, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that they are one factor, but “certainly not the only factor, and it’s not necessarily a dispositive factor.” “From day one, as you heard me say, we have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed, and I have no doubt that we’ll continue to do that as this evolves,” Blinken said at a news conference in Kyiv with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The revelation that Iran has been providing Russia with ballistic missiles has changed the debate over Ukraine’s capabilities, Lammy said. Other top American officials have sounded more skeptical. Last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pushed back on the notion that lifting the restrictions and hitting deeper into Russia is a silver bullet, saying that “there’s no one capability that will, in and of itself, be decisive in this campaign.” “There are a lot of targets in Russia – a big country, obviously,” Austin said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Friday. “And there’s a lot of capability that Ukraine has in terms of (unmanned aerial vehicles) and other things to address those targets.” A US official said the administration views Ukraine’s long-range attacks on Crimea, and Russia’s naval fleet there, as a much more effective use of the ATACMS, and a strategy that has been yielding significant success in recent months. The Defense Department has a limited stockpile of the long-range systems, the official said, so the US has been trying to persuade Ukraine to use them to the maximum effect possible rather than on disparate targets in Russia that the US considers to have little strategic value. A separate US official said they expect Russia to continue to move assets out of reach of the long-range systems and noted that “several hundred” ATACMS have been transferred to Ukraine “and Ukraine has used most of them.” Despite those reservations, a growing chorus of voices in Washington is calling for the restrictions to be lifted. Senior Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including its chairman Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, have said the restrictions should be eased in order to provide Ukraine a better chance of success. “In light of Putin’s increasingly horrific attacks on civilian targets, it’s time to lift restrictions on the use of long-range US-provided weapons to allow Ukraine to reach high value Russian military targets,” Shaheen said. Earlier in the week, the bipartisan congressional Ukraine caucus called on Biden to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with the long-range weapons. “Unless these restrictions are lifted, Ukraine will continue to struggle to achieve victory in its fight to defend its sovereignty and its people. The Ukrainian people will continue to suffer unnecessary death, loss, and hardship as Russia capitalizes on this policy and escalates its bombardments across Ukraine,” the bipartisan lawmakers wrote. A group of key House Republican also urged Biden to ease the restrictions in a letter on Monday. And in a separate open letter , 17 former national security officials, including former US ambassadors to Ukraine and top military commanders, called on Blinken and Lammy to “act with alacrity.” “A change in policy cannot come soon enough,” they wrote."

He had seconds to react. “It was very quick. We ran to the trees and then there was a bang a meter or two away from me,” the Ukrainian soldier said. “I look down and I see I have pieces of it in my leg. I don’t know what’s happening, so I put a tourniquet on and try to get out,” Vasyl – callsign Bumblebee – told CNN in Sumy, the northern Ukrainian city where he is recovering from his injuries. Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region last month, taking Moscow by surprise and quickly advancing some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the border. But the campaign slowed and, on Thursday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Russia had launched “counteroffensive actions .” A group of Ukrainian soldiers rest after completing a long missing in Russia's Kursk region. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Related article Outgunned and outnumbered, Ukraine’s military is struggling with low morale and desertion The Russian Ministry of Defense said Russian forces had “penetrated” into the Kursk region, capturing 10 settlements. In the days leading up to this counter-attack, CNN spoke with 14 Ukrainian soldiers from five different units who were deployed to Kursk as part of the incursion. Four were wounded in the operation and are currently recovering in hospitals in Ukraine, while the other 10 are still conducting missions in Russia. They included infantrymen, members of a drone unit, armored vehicle drivers and sappers, or frontline combat engineers. Most have asked to remain anonymous or be identified by their first name and callsign only, given the sensitive nature of the topic and security concerns. All 14 said the Kursk counteroffensive was a difficult operation with casualty rates on par with other parts of the frontlines. They said it was getting tougher, five weeks in, and some even questioned the decision to launch the incursion at a time when Ukraine was struggling to defend key towns and cities in the east of the country. “It will get more and more difficult. There will be more artillery fire, more soldiers, and there will be very big and difficult battles, but we must do everything we can that improves our position – Ukraine wants peace, but peace when we win, not when we lose,” Vasyl said. “Russia is sending a lot of troops and artillery (to Kursk). We have a lot of guys who have been killed and we have a lot of destroyed hardware,” he added. A group of Ukrainian soldiers rest in a village near the Russian border after taking part in Ukraine’s operation in Kursk. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Ukrainian officials said Moscow has sent some 30,000 troops into the Kursk region. Two officers with knowledge of the situation said these reinforcements included soldiers from the now dissolved Wagner Private Military Company who the officers believed had been redeployed from West Africa. The Wagner mercenaries were meant to be officially absorbed into the Russian military following the death of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin last year. But the Ukrainian soldiers operating in Kursk said Wagner fighters were distinguishable from the rest of the Russian troops because they have much better equipment and are better trained than the regular soldiers. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov also claimed shortly after the start of the incursion that the Chechen special forces unit Akhmat was in the area. Dmytro, Vasyl’s commander who oversees the Ukrainian Nightingale battalion, told CNN his unit had also found Wagner flags and insignia in the area – something other soldiers also confirmed. While Russia has managed to reclaim control of some small settlements in recent days,  Ukraine still controls the vast majority of the territory it took over in the first days of the incursion, according to an assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitoring group. Dmytro (right), the commander of Ukraine's “Nightingale” battalion, visits Vasyl, a member of the battalion who was wounded in Russia. Ivana Kottasova/CNN ‘Tactical achievement’ The Kursk operation has given the Ukrainians a huge morale boost, being Kyiv’s first big strategic gain since the liberation of Kherson in November 2022. Nearly all of the soldiers CNN spoke with said that giving Russia a taste of its own medicine was worth the pain. “It was a good feeling. Russia is one of the biggest countries by territory, by population, by the size of its military. And they have nuclear bombs. We don’t have a lot of people and we have been at war for 10 years, since Russia attacked us and occupied some parts of (the) Luhansk and Donetsk regions,” Vasyl said, referring to Moscow’s support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, when Crimea was also illegally annexed by the Kremlin. “And now we see that, even after (all) this time, we can attack (Russia’s) territory and say to all the world, ‘Don’t be scared. Be brave. Be strong and smart.’” CNN's Christiane Amanpour interviews Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi. Ivana Kottasová/CNN Related article Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion Dmytro, whose callsign is Kholod – or Cold in Ukrainian – gave a simple assessment: “F**k yes! That’s the feeling when I saw our tanks shooting at the Russian positions. They put their hands up, we took a lot of prisoners.” In an exclusive interview with CNN last week, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi gave what was the most detailed explanation yet of the rationale behind the incursion. He said its aim was to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a “security zone” and prevent cross-border shelling of civilians, to take prisoners of war and – indeed – to boost the morale of Ukraine’s troops and the nation overall. Zelensky, meanwhile, said that another goal of the operation was to show Kyiv’s Western allies that with the right support, its military can fight back and eventually win the war. Ukraine has been under pressure on its eastern front for most of this year and is still struggling to recover from the huge setbacks caused by delays in the delivery of US military assistance last winter and in the spring. The Kursk offensive, which came as a surprise even to some of Ukraine’s closest allies, was hailed by Western officials. On Saturday, CIA director Bill Burns called it “a significant tactical achievement.” “It has not only been a boost in Ukrainian morale. It has exposed some of the vulnerabilities of Putin’s Russia and of its military,” Burns said, speaking in London. A big, tangible win was much needed, and welcomed, within Ukraine. But soldiers involved in the operation who spoke with CNN said it was a difficult undertaking. One soldier, callsign Fin, said Russia’s fortifications were built very well, combining different types of defensive measures – for example by placing mines underneath the anti-tank obstacles known as dragon’s teeth. His entire team – four men with years of experience – was completely exhausted, he said. They were among the first units to cross into Russia, tasked with demining and dismantling defenses before Ukrainian infantry and artillery units arrived there. They spent two weeks inside Kursk, working non-stop, catching a couple of hours of sleep here and there, always on alert. There were many casualties, they said. One soldier pointed to his boots and said one could take “a lot of DNA samples” from them. “Ukrainian DNA, unfortunately,” he said. Fin said that the fact that they were operating on foreign land, in an area they didn’t know, made their mission uniquely challenging. Most of the units taking part in the Kursk operation were redeployed from other parts of the frontline, from areas they have got to know extremely well over the past two and half years. An injured crewmember of an armoured personnel carrier told CNN that Ukrainian troops were facing major navigational problems in Kursk. Ivana Kottasova/CNN One crew member of an armored personnel carrier (APC) that was transporting Ukrainian infantry troops around the Kursk region told CNN his unit was sent there from Chasiv Yar, on the eastern frontline, where he could “drive blindfolded from one position to another.” In Kursk, he and his crew got lost. “We ended up going to (the Russian town of) Sudzha, where we had to wait for our commander to find us,” he said, adding poor visibility and the crew’s lack of knowledge of the terrain made navigation extremely difficult. Several units have told CNN that navigation and communication between units and their commanders were a major problem in Kursk. With GPS and cellphone signals jammed, the Ukrainians have been relying on the Starlink internet service. But they are finding the service doesn’t work at all in certain parts of the Kursk region. Vasyl Stus Lyceum of International Relations/Facebook Related article In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a missile strike The APC crewmember said that these communication disruptions meant they couldn’t contact their commander for many hours. The area has been experiencing drought for several months and the land is now very dry, which makes it even more challenging to move around in heavy vehicles that stir up the dust. The APC crew member and his commander spoke with CNN in northern Ukraine, where they were recuperating from injuries they said were sustained when two Ukrainian armored vehicles crashed into each other because of very poor visibility and no navigation signal. If the line of control remains largely unchanged, the battle in the Kursk region could soon start to resemble parts of the frontline in eastern Ukraine, with both sides digging in and fighting hard for every inch of land. One sapper said his unit’s mission in Kursk had changed dramatically recently. He spoke with CNN in a small village on the Ukrainian side of the border after coming back from a particularly grueling mission. “If it was easy, you wouldn’t see the medical evacuation vehicles up and down the road,” one soldier told CNN while resting on the Ukrainian side of the border. Just a few weeks ago, he and his team were removing Russian defenses and clearing minefields to enable Ukrainian infantry to advance deeper into Russia. Now, he said, they are doing the opposite: laying mines and preparing defenses aimed at stopping Russian troops from pushing back.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN Control your fear Like all the soldiers CNN spoke with, Vasyl and his commander, Kholod, had no idea they would end up going into Russia when they were redeployed to the Sumy region from Pokrovsk in the east. “We all thought that the Russians were going to come here, because we didn’t have a lot of time. There was a meeting and my commander told me that we needed to be in Sumy in three days,” Kholod said. “And then the day when it all started, I was in a meeting with other commanders and they showed me the map and told me what they are going to do, where they are going to drive, what they are going to ambush, and I understood we are going to Russia.” Speaking to CNN, Vasyl said he didn’t think too much about the mission – or the fact he got injured in it – preferring to remain in the here-and-now. “This is war. We are soldiers, and we must do all that we can to protect our country. This is part of a big plan and I haven’t questioned why I’m here.” Sitting on a bench in Sumy, with his bandaged leg stretched out and an IV needle protruding from near his elbow, Vasyl said the frontline was swarming with explosive Russian drones on the day he was wounded. “Guys from another unit came by and I told them to be careful because it was like a drone slaughterhouse in there… and just that second, bang,” he said, adding a few expletives. His mates told him he was lucky to survive. Kholod, who was one of the first to get to him after the blast, commended his calm demeanor after the attack. Vasyl said that was just his nature. “The most important (thing) when you are very scared, is to be in control. If you can control your fear, everything will be all right,” he said. The doctors told him it was too risky to remove some of the pieces of shrapnel. “The doctor said that the pieces will stay in my body, they are too difficult to remove, it’s better if they stay. I say ‘OK , OK , you are the doctor,’” Vasyl told CNN, not batting an eyelid over the idea of living the rest of his life with remnants of Russian explosives  stuck inside him. “So what,” he added. “I’m not going to become a Russian from these pieces. It doesn’t work like with vampires!”"

Ukraine has been anticipating a Russian reaction and a counteroffensive is in line with the ‘Ukrainian plan,’ Zelensky said. Zelensky has previously said that the surprise attack on Russia’s Kursk region was the initial step in a four-part “victory plan.” The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Thursday that Russian forces had “penetrated” into the Kursk region, capturing 10 settlements. A social media video geolocated by CNN showed a Russian mechanized assault group in the settlement of Snagost on the western edge of territory controlled by Ukraine. On August 6, Ukrainian forces stormed into the Kursk region in a shock, lightning strike that caught even American officials by surprise. It marked the first foreign attack on Russian soil since World War Two and saw thousands of troops burst through the border into the region armed with heavy weaponry. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities. The attack left Russia scrambling to shore up its defenses, with US officials telling CNN that Moscow had to divert thousands of troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter the threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin was forced to bring in conscripts, backpeddling on a promise he made not to use them on the frontline. Last week, Zelensky said Ukraine had captured around 100 settlements in the Kursk region, and around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. One aim of the incursion was to divert Russian forces away from the eastern frontline in Ukraine, where they continue to make incremental gains. Another apparent goal was to boost morale in the Ukrainian army after a torrid few months. Experts told CNN that Ukraine’s bold gambit to breach Russia’s border – planned in total secrecy – had stunned even Kyiv’s closest allies and shifted the playing field of a more than two-year war. In a joint public appearance on Sunday, both CIA chief Bill Burns and Head of MI6 Richard Moore endorsed Ukraine’s invasion of Kursk , with Moore saying that it changed the narrative, and Burns that it was a significant tactical achievement. Red Cross workers killed In a separate development, Russian shelling killed three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while they were working in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky said. The ICRC said its workers were killed when their vehicles were hit as they prepared to distribute wood and coal briquettes to residents in the region. The organization did not say who was behind the shelling. ”We are shattered,” ICRC Ukraine Spokesman Pat Griffith told CNN. “Three of my colleagues killed, two injured, during an aid distribution in Donetsk region.” The three ICRC staffers who were killed in the artillery shelling were Ukrainian nationals, Ukraine’s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. ICRC teams are regularly present in the Donetsk region and their vehicles are “clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem,” the organization said. The ICRC called for the respect of international humanitarian law, “including by taking every precaution possible to ensure that those engaged in humanitarian activities are not targeted or caught in hostilities.” Zelensky called the shelling on the ICRC team “another Russian war crime.” CNN’s Radina Gigova contributed to this report."

She’s working fast, but even at her busiest, the nurse anesthetist doesn’t hesitate to pause to adjust a pillow or blanket, and make sure the injured soldiers in her care are as comfortable as possible amid the constant rocking and rumbling. A sergeant in the Ukrainian military , she is attending to some of its sickest patients. It’s a busy job – and she is doing it on a speeding train. CNN gained exclusive access to a medical evacuation train used by the Ukrainian army to transport the wounded from near the frontlines to hospitals around this large country. This infirmary on wheels – one of several crisscrossing the nation – is now a key part of Ukraine’s healthcare system, which has been highly depleted by two and half years of Russia’s brutal war. It is operating in complete secrecy, which is why CNN is not revealing its route or identifying its staff by their full names. Most cities in eastern Ukraine are struggling to find enough hospital beds to accommodate the almost constant stream of casualties from the frontlines. But freeing up space requires that even the sickest patients, many of them unconscious, are transferred to far-flung places, often hundreds of miles away. Long ambulance journeys are too risky for people in a critical condition, and flying a helicopter is too dangerous given Russia’s air superiority over Ukrainian skies. The train is a lifesaver. In the hospital on wheels, every procedure brings unique challenges. Ivana Kottasova/CNN The evacuation train transports wounded soldiers from the frontlines to hospitals across Ukraine. Ivana Kottasova/CNN “We can do almost everything here. It’s a fully-fledged intensive care unit,” Oleksandr, who is a captain of the Ukrainian Medical Forces and the train’s chief resident, told CNN. He explained that his field – combat medicine – mostly involves stabilizing and evacuating patients to safety, rather than carrying out treatment. His work on the train is just one part of a medical chain that starts the moment a soldier is wounded. “The most difficult part is evacuation from the frontline,” he said. “Combat medics who work on the front are dying just like soldiers.” Running an ICU unit on a moving train is a herculean task that involves dozens of people and presents a unique set of challenges. CNN Oleksandr said the vast majority of his patients, some 90%, have suffered multiple shrapnel injuries. Many have had amputations, and several are intubated, alive thanks to ventilators and other life-support machines. All have numbers written on their hands showing which car of the long evacuation train they need to travel on. “We are very limited in our capabilities here… If something happens, I cannot call an outside consultant,” he said. “There may be minor operations, to stop bleeding. We cannot perform abdominal… and chest surgeries. We have to be very careful when selecting the patients,” he added. Yevgeniy was severely wounded in a drone attack just two days before he was selected for evacuation on the ICU unit of the train. He suffered multiple shrapnel injuries. His head was bandaged and two huge scars on his chest and stomach were covered with fresh dressings. Breathing with the aid of an oxygen nasal cannula, Yevgeniy told CNN he was the lucky one, as the only survivor from the attack near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine . He said he wasn’t going to tell his family about his injuries until he was feeling better. Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr said he was injured by shrapnel and lost hearing in one ear after a Russian drone attack. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Ukraine’s most important train The railway hospital is an example of the kind of Ukrainian ingenuity that impressed the world in the early months of this conflict. Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, the CEO of passenger operations at Ukrainian Railways, told CNN that Ukraine did not have any medical railcars when Russia launched its full-scale invasion on the country in February 2022. “So what we saw is that the wounded soldiers were physically just forced through the windows (of regular trains). And we said something has to be done about that… and started retrofitting our regular railcars that in peaceful days would just bring tourists to the Carpathian Mountains,” he told CNN after overseeing the arrival of one of the medical trains. To limit rocking, the vehicle travels at about 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour, which is about half the speed of a regular train. It also has priority over everyone else – including any special VIP trains carrying foreign dignitaries. Even so, the ICU unit is constantly shaking. Every piece of equipment, every bed and every beeping machine needs to be anchored to the floor and the staff must take extra care when working on the patients. The railway hospital is an example of the kind of Ukrainian ingenuity that impressed the world in the early months of this conflict. CNN has blurred part of this image for security reasons. Ivana Kottasova/CNN The train provides a small window into the brutal cost of war. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Ambulance trains were first used during the Crimean War in the 1850s, but they have come a long way since then. The modern Ukrainian versions come equipped with ventilators, life support machines, ultrasound scanners and portable air conditioners that help maintain stable temperatures even on the hottest days. Each carriage is a self-sustained unit powered by generators – an important safety feature given the frequent Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Pertsovskyi said. But it is the little touches that make these trains truly special. Children’s drawings and Ukrainian flags are on display in every car, offering some comfort to the bruised and battered passengers. The blind brackets on every window are shaped as a trident, the country’s national symbol, placed deliberately in the eyeline of soldiers lying in their beds. A tale of two deployments The train provides a small window into the brutal cost of war. Experienced warriors and new recruits are traveling together, united by injury and pain. Sitting quietly on his bed Oleksandr looked tired even before the long journey began. He told CNN he was hurt in a Russian drone strike. “They dropped a grenade. I was stunned. I have shrapnel in my hands, on my shoulders and on my back,” he said, adding that the blast wave damaged his hearing. An electrician and a father of two, the 35-year-old was mobilized 18 months ago and was serving as an anti-tank gunner in an infantry battalion in the Donetsk region. In all that time, he has spent just 45 days away from the frontlines. “Morale is high, but people are very tired,” he said with a blank stare, as the train kept chugging along. “At this point you realize that everything depends not on you, but on God. Or on luck. When the bombs fall, there is not much you can do about it.” It was a sobering assessment from a man with the callsign “Positive.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has long admitted that the military is struggling to replenish its ranks, leaving exhausted soldiers without a chance to rest. At a news conference last month, Zelensky said this effort to recruit more soldiers was gathering steam. “Some rotations have started. I can’t call it fundamental rotations yet, to be honest. But it’s a start, and that’s very important,” he said. The fatigue is affecting frontline morale. CNN recently spoke with multiple Ukrainian commanders and officers who said desertion and insubordination is becoming a growing problem, especially among new recruits. Sitting just a few beds away from Oleksandr was Stanislav, who enlisted voluntarily just three months ago. He was also wounded by a drone that dropped into his trench, leaving him with a punctured lung, broken ribs and other injuries. Yet Stanislav appeared in a completely different state of mind to Oleksandr. “After I was wounded, my spirits didn’t dim. I got more motivated,” he told CNN with a smile. Wearing a sports jersey and shorts, he was adamant Ukraine would win the war, despite being outnumbered and outgunned by Russia. “They use quantity, and we use quality,” he said. CNN The incredible price of war Nearly nine hours into its journey, the hospital train finally pulled into a railway station in one of Ukraine’s cities. In the darkness of the night, a long line of ambulances was awaiting the patients. The train’s voyage was over, but their road to recovery was only starting. Some will likely never fully recover. Olga, the ICU nurse, was getting ready to hand her patients over to the medics on the platform. Her job was done for the day. She joined the military as a civilian nurse in 2015, a year after the conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine started in the eastern parts of the country, and Crimea was illegally annexed by the Kremlin. She enlisted in the military in 2016 and – except for a short break in 2022 – has served ever since. After her shift ended, she told CNN that seeing critically ill patients coming from the frontlines is the toughest part of her job. Olga is a nurse anesthetist and a sergeant in Ukraine’s military who works in the train's ICU unit. Ivana Kottasova/CNN “But we have the opportunity to provide much-needed help to our defenders 24/7, and that’s the best part.” When the ambulances departed and the train left the station, Pertsovskyi, the railway chief, was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. The medical train is thought to be a major target for Moscow and there have recently been several strikes targeting the vicinity of railway stations and other infrastructure. Standing on the platform, just hours after he saw a train full of new recruits headed in the opposite direction, he reflected on the brutality of the conflict. “In the morning, I see these kids who are saying goodbye to their dads who are heading towards the frontlines,” he said. “So, seeing those same guys coming back… unconscious or with amputations, it feels like the price of the war is incredible. It’s a conveyor belt.” CNN’s Victoria Butenko and Olha Konovalova contributed to this report."

Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen on Wednesday became the latest senior lawmaker to call for the restrictions to be lifted, saying in a statement to CNN that “in light of Putin’s increasingly horrific attacks on civilian targets, it’s time to lift restrictions on the use of long-range U.S.-provided weapons to allow Ukraine to reach high value Russian military targets.” “On the expectation that the Ukrainian government has demonstrated how these new authorities fit within its broader campaign strategy, I hope that the Biden Administration will swiftly grant these permissions to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. An aide to the senator told CNN that they are hopeful that Shaheen’s public call for the restrictions to be lifted will be impactful as the administration weighs the option. “As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Appropriations Committee and Armed Services Committee, the Senator’s voice on this issue lends itself to show that there is political cover for making this sort of announcement,” the aide explained. Congress weighing in is “a really important element for the administration,” the aide noted. “They need to hear from Democrats and Republicans that they support this decision, because it does have implications also for the appropriators and authorizers.” Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin released a statement earlier Wednesday calling for the restrictions to be eased, in light of “Vladimir Putin’s relentless attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure,” that he called “horrifying.” “Given these escalating attacks, the time has come to ease restrictions on Ukrainian’s use of U.S.-provided weapons. Greater flexibility to target Russian military assets will degrade Moscow’s ability to harm the Ukrainian people. The United States must act swiftly to grant these permissions,” the Maryland Democrat wrote. Cardin and Shaheen’s statements, released on the same day Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv, added to a growing chorus of those calling Biden to allow Kyiv to strike deep within Russia. The Ukrainian government, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly been making the appeal. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, left, and and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken board a train as they prepare to travel to Ukraine on September 11 in Eastern Poland. Leon Neal/Getty Images Blinken and Zelensky discussed the restrictions during their meeting in Kyiv Wednesday. Blinken told reporters he would share that discussion with Biden. “From day one, as you heard me say, we have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed, and I have no doubt that we’ll continue to do that as this evolves,” Blinken said at a news conference in Kyiv with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Although the US has shifted its policy to allow limited cross-border strikes into Russia using US-provided weapons, the administration has yet to allow longer-ranger strikes. Officials have expressed concern about the potential for escalation and have argued that any one capability will be decisive in the war. A US official told CNN Tuesday that US intelligence shows that Russia has moved a number of assets outside of the reach of long-range strikes. Asked about the concerns of escalation, Blinken said Wednesday that they are one factor, but “certainly not the only factor, and it’s not necessarily a dispositive factor.” He also accused Russia of escalation with its acquisition of Iranian ballistic missiles. “We’ve now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine, so if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,” said Blinken. Meanwhile, there is a growing chorus of voices in Washington calling for the restrictions to be lifted. On Tuesday, the bipartisan congressional Ukraine caucus called on Biden to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with the long-range weapons. “Unless these restrictions are lifted, Ukraine will continue to struggle to achieve victory in its fight to defend its sovereignty and its people. The Ukrainian people will continue to suffer unnecessary death, loss, and hardship as Russia capitalizes on this policy and escalates its bombardments across Ukraine,” the bipartisan lawmakers wrote. A group of key House Republican also urged Biden to ease the restrictions in a letter on Monday. In a separate open letter , 17 former national security officials, including former US ambassadors to Ukraine and top military commanders, called on Blinken and Lammy to “act with alacrity.” “A change in policy cannot come soon enough,” they wrote. On Tuesday, asked if the US will lift the restrictions, Biden answered, “we’re working that out right now.” Two US officials later told CNN that the Biden administration is not anticipating any policy changes when it comes to lifting restrictions. Still, others have said that the debate over the matter is ongoing. In Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken vowed support for Ukraine’s victory as he sought to make the case that assistance for Kyiv will endure regardless of the outcome of the US election. His comments stand in stark contrast to remarks from Donald Trump at Wednesday’s debate, where the former president repeatedly refused to say he was committed to Ukraine’s victory. “The bottom line is this: we want Ukraine to win, and we’re fully committed to keep marshaling the support that it needs for its brave defenders and citizens to do just that,” the top US diplomat said at a news conference in Kyiv. “Support for Ukraine will endure because it doesn’t depend on any one country, any one party, any one election,” Blinken added. He reiterated NATO’s commitment to Ukraine’s “irreversible path” to membership in the alliance. Asked about Trump’s comments, Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, also downplayed them. “We will, without a doubt, have a new president of the United States, but we believe in steadfast support from the US nation, the American nation. We believe strongly in bipartisan support, and we clearly believe, and we are convinced, that fair, comprehensive, sustainable peace in Ukraine is also a strategic interest for the United States of America,” he said via an interpreter. Blinken announced significant new funding for Ukraine: “$325 million in new funding to help repair Ukraine’s energy and electric grid,” “$290 million in new humanitarian support to help provide vital services like safe drinking, water, food, shelter, medicine”; and “$102 million in additional funding in humanitarian demining.” This story has been updated with additional developments."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/republicans-urge-biden-lift-restrictions-ukraine-targets-inside-russia/index.html,Senior Republicans urge Biden to lift restrictions on Ukraine hitting targets deep inside Russia,A group of key House Republicans have written to President Joe Biden urging him to lift the restrictions on the use of US-provided long-range weapons systems and allow Kyiv to strike targets deep inside Russia.,"Sep 11, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Kylie Atwood,Ukraine,"CNN — A group of key House Republicans have written to President Joe Biden urging him to lift the restrictions on the use of US-provided long-range weapons systems and allow Kyiv to strike targets deep inside Russia. The letter , dated Monday, echoes repeated appeals from the Ukrainian government itself, including President Volodymyr Zelensky. It was sent ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to the Ukrainian capital Wednesday and as the Biden administration continues to assess Kyiv’s request to carry out strikes deeper inside Russia. US officials expect Blinken, who traveled to Ukraine Wednesday with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, to gather information during his trip to Kyiv on how these longer-range strikes would factor into Ukraine’s broader battlefield strategy. The UK is also considering whether to allow Ukraine to strike deeper inside Russia with its own long-range system, the Storm Shadow. Blinken said he expects the topic to be discussed when Biden and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer meet Friday in Washington. “We’ll be listening intently to our Ukrainian partners. We’ll both be reporting back to the prime minister, to President Biden in the coming days. And I fully anticipate this is something they’ll take up when they meet on Friday,” the top US diplomat said in London Tuesday. Asked later Tuesday if the US will lift the restrictions, Biden answered, “we’re working that out right now.” Two US officials later told CNN that the Biden administration is not anticipating any policy changes when it comes to lifting restrictions. “No change to policy,” one senior administration official said, adding that there is currently no openness to lifting restrictions. Another US official echoed this, saying despite the fact that American and Ukrainian officials discuss this issue with regularity, the administration is not anticipating policy changes on ATACMS. The Republican lawmakers argue that the restrictions “have hampered Ukraine’s ability to defeat Russia’s war of aggression and have given the Kremlin’s forces a sanctuary from which it can attack Ukraine with impunity.” “It is far past time the administration reverses course and lifts the remaining restrictions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-provided weapons against legitimate military targets in Russia,” the lawmakers wrote. The letter was signed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Michael Turner, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, House Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Thomas Kean, and Helsinki Commissioner Richard Hudson. It hits out at decisions from the “Biden-Harris administration,” but stands in contrast to sentiments from the Republican presidential and vice presidential contenders, who have suggested they could stem assistance to Ukraine if elected. Former President Donald Trump has also repeatedly vowed to bring an end to the war. Last week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pushed back on the notion that lifting the restrictions and hitting deeper into Russia is a silver bullet, saying that “there’s no one capability that will, in and of itself, be decisive in this campaign.” “There are a lot of targets in Russia — a big country, obviously,” Austin said at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Friday. “And there’s a lot of capability that Ukraine has in terms of (unmanned aerial vehicles) and other things to address those targets.” A US official said “several hundred” ATACMS have been transferred to Ukraine “and Ukraine has used most of them.” As with previous steps the US has taken to bolster Ukraine on the battlefield, there are concerns within the administration that allowing Ukraine to strike further inside Russia could escalate the conflict and cause Russia to further accuse the US of being a part of the war. However, the Republican lawmakers argued that “the administration’s concerns about escalation have been consistently invalidated since Day One of the war.” “Neither Ukraine’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Russia nor its military incursion into Russia’s Kursk region – the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II – have triggered a Russian escalatory response,” they wrote. Debate ongoing with administration The debate on Ukraine’s request is ongoing and some US officials expect the administration to green-light the Ukrainian ask, while others said it is possible the ultimate answer will be no. A Ukrainian lawmaker told CNN that they hope that the transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia will be enough to tip the scales and shift the administration’s position. The US official noted that they had been tracking the expected delivery of the missiles for months and the US has “been accounting for it.” Still, in London on Tuesday, Blinken indicated a willingness to change the US posture on the topic, saying that the US has routinely showed a willingness to adapt and adjust support for Ukraine based on “battlefield conditions.” One objective of the trip will be learning from Zelensky “exactly how the Ukrainians see their needs in this moment, toward what objectives, and what we can do to support those needs,” Blinken said. US intelligence assesses that more than 90% of Russian aircraft launching glide bombs and firing missiles against Ukraine are based at airfields that are at least 300 km from Ukrainian-controlled territory, putting them outside of ATACMS range, the US official explained. “We expect this number to continue to increase. For example, Russia recently relocated its glide bomb missions from two airfields, which were located closer to the front, father east to airfields that are outside of range of ATCMS,” the official said. In their letter, the Republican lawmakers argued that “there remain numerous other legitimate military targets in range in Russian territory.” “The Institute for the Study of War assesses that, excluding airfields, there are over 200 legitimate military targets within range of U.S.-provided weapons to include military bases, logistics nodes, fuel depots, ammunition warehouses, and command and control systems,” they wrote. Last month, senior Ukrainians presented US officials with targets they would like to strike in Russia during a visit to Washington. US officials reviewed their lists but did not ultimately give the Ukrainians a decision. The US also has a limited stock of ATACMS available to provide Ukraine without impacting US military readiness, and using the weapons to strike far inside Russia would deplete Ukraine’s stockpile of ATACMS that could be used for other parts of their military campaign such as inside Crimea. But the Ukrainians say there are weapons productions facilities that would be within reach of the ATACMS inside Russia that are worthy military targets, a source familiar with the Ukrainians position told CNN. These discussions come as Ukraine has shown a willingness to possibly engage with Russia to begin talks to end the war. While US officials do not expect any talks to begin in the coming months, some are wary of Ukrainians going to the table with Russia before they are in the best possible position to begin those talks. “It’s going to be up to President Zelensky if and when he wants to negotiate an end to this war, certainly a negotiated end is the most likely outcome here, but when that happens, and under what conditions and circumstances that’s going to be up to President Zelensky,” John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, said on Tuesday. “The point that Secretary Blinken will make is that that we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that if and when he’s ready to make that decision, that he does so from the best possible position. And so that’s what, that’s what this trip is really about. It’s not arm twisting. It’s about learning.” This story has been updated with additional details. CNN’s MJ Lee contributed to this report."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/europe/pokrovsk-ukraine-prisoners-enlist-soldiers-intl-cmd/index.html,"From convict to combatant, Ukraine enlists prisoners to fight Russian forces",Lurking in the bushes near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is a unit of men who have two things in common: The short amount of time they have served defending their nation and time spent behind bars.,"Sep 11, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Sebastian Shukla,Ukraine,"Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine, CNN — Lurking in the bushes near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is a unit of men who have two things in common: The short amount of time they have served defending their nation and time spent behind bars. The 15 infantry men of the 59th Brigade, part of the Shkval – or wind gust - battalion are former prisoners. Convicted of a variety of crimes, they see their service in defense of Ukraine as redemption and a chance at a new life without a criminal record. The catch for prisoners is that they are contracted to the military until the end of the war. There is also a considerable financial incentive: Wages range from $500 to $4,000 per month, depending on time spent on the front line, according to the Ukrainian defense ministry. CNN was granted exclusive access to these recently recruited prisoners last week, near the crucial Donbas town of Pokrovsk. The city has become a focal point in recent weeks as part of the nearly 600-mile line of contact that is desperately short of men, ammunition and ever encroaching better supplied and vast Russian forces. Among the recruits is Vitaly, 41, a recovered addict and a father-of-five. He asked to be identified by first name only for security reasons. Vitaly told CNN that he had served 10 years in prison for four different crimes, most recently for grievous bodily harm. Perched on a tree stump, Vitaly mumbles: “My life was crazy. I grew up with bandits, as did all of our guys (in the unit).” But by joining the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, he saw an opportunity. “I need to turn the page of my life. My life was a mess. It’s better to be useful here, to be around brothers … and a completely different social circle,” he said. He’s been in the trenches for three months following a short, 21-day training period. Vitaly has no regrets about his choice to join the army, but he said he was naive about what to expect. “Life is hard here, it’s fun … but I didn’t think it would be this hard,” he said. Life as an infantry soldier is particularly dangerous with casualties higher than other members of the military. Infantry soldiers are often exposed to Russian drone attacks and storming trenches as they traverse large expanses of land by foot. Vitaly recalls a particularly brutal drone attack on a comrade. Vitaly, 41, has five children and has served a total of 10 years for four different crimes, the most recent of which was grievous bodily harm. CNN “He was taken apart. It is so hard to watch… but what can you do? You can’t help. You need to leave them behind because half of the man is already gone,” he said. In June, the defense ministry launched an initiative that gives prisoners the chance to serve in the army, in exchange for freedom after the war. There are strict rules around recruiting prisoners into the army, however. Convicts who have committed rape or any kind of sexual violence are prohibited from joining. The majority of the ex-cons CNN met had been jailed for offenses such as robbery or grievous bodily harm. The Shkval battalion told CNN that they’re making legal requests to allow prisoners who have committed murder to join their ranks, because they feel those inmates may possess the skills needed on the battlefield. Vitaly is one of 4,650 convicts, including 31 women, who have been released and called up for military service, Ukraine’s defense ministry told CNN. In total, 5,764 had expressed a desire to serve. The ministry did not say how many were currently serving on the front lines The convict-to-combat initiative as well as a conscription reform are an attempt to bolster the faltering ranks of Ukrainian soldiers after two-and-half years of grinding war. But people CNN spoke to along the front line hinted at problems with the program, including inconsistent and short training periods. Those difficulties, coupled with chronic manpower shortages, are stunting Ukraine’s ability to repel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, they said. With life on the front line more challenging than many expected, Vitaly now wishes that he’d paid closer attention during his short training. He thinks it may have better prepared him for what was to come. “We were stupid and didn’t take it seriously. We were not responsible; it was a mistake not to listen or pay attention,” he said. Oleksandr was a former prison guard before the war and is now back in the de-facto position. He says ""the convict sub-culture is used to surviving."" CNN Keeping the peace Ensuring there is no disruption to the peace in the unit is Oleksandr, the company commander. Vitaly’s company commander Oleksandr is no stranger to convicts. He left his position as a prison guard in February 2022, when the war began. Now, despite his protestations, he is back in his old job – but this time, on the battlefield. “They see me as a former prison guard, as a brother-in-arms, as a commander, everyone here lives as one family,” Oleksandr, who also asked to be identified only by his first name, said of the soldiers, adding, “I am a psychologist, father, mother, everything.” Along with the 15 prisoners already in his unit, he’s expecting a further 25 from the prison where he used to work. Oleksandr said that many convicts, like Vitaly, signed up with the aim of reforming themselves. “Many of them have families in front of whom they were ashamed of what they did. They have children who are told that their father is a convict. When he joins the armed forces, he is no longer a convict – but a hero,” Oleksandr said. CNN gained access to the freed prisoners of Skhval battalion of the 59th brigade near Pokrovsk. CNN During CNN’s time with the brigade in Pokrovsk, we were approached by another officer who said that morale was dwindling as the best Western weapons had been diverted towards the Kursk incursion, troops were lacking motivation and both soft-skin and armored vehicles were dwindling, complicating logistics and evacuations. The officer, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, said that a few days earlier they’d refused to fight alongside troops from a new brigade of freshly drafted men, due to their low morale and motivation to fight. Still, morale may be Ukraine’s only hope in Pokrovsk as Russian forces zero in on the town. At sundown in the town, the streets empty and the artillery barrages begin. Russian forces are only 8 kilometers (5 miles) away, according to a map dated September 10 from DeepState, a group that monitors the progress of Russian forces in Ukraine that has links to Ukraine’s security services. Pokrovsk is coming under increasingly heavy bombardment by Russian forces as they advance as close as 8km to the town. CNN Pokrovsk is a vital supply town for eastern Ukrainian forces fighting back the tides of Russian soldiers. Its capture would be a coup for Putin as he looks to take control of the entire region of Donetsk. It could result in a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Chasiv Yar and the line of contact moving closer to the much larger cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Oleksandr is aware of the unenviable task of holding the Russians at bay, but thinks his troops have a skill that others don’t. “The convict sub-culture is used to surviving. This means physical endurance, moral endurance, plus cunning, logical thinking, much higher than those of ordinary civilians.”"

Secretary of State Antony Blinken previewed the move to impose sanctions on Iran Air earlier Tuesday calling Iran’s supply of the missiles to Moscow “a dramatic escalation.” The foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and Germany on Tuesday jointly called the missile transfer “a direct threat to European security.” In addition to moving towards sanctions, they also said their countries “will be taking immediate steps to cancel bilateral air services agreements with Iran.” That move will restrict Iran Air’s ability to fly into Europe and the UK. “The E3 has privately and publicly been clear that we would take new and significant measures against Iran if the transfers took place,” they said in a joint statement, using “E3” in reference to their trio of countries. Tuesday is not the first time the US has imposed sanctions on Iran Air and it is unclear whether the latest punitive measures will actually serve to deter Tehran. Still, the joint actions are intended to send a sharp rebuke of Iran’s ongoing support of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Beyond the additional sanctions on Iran Air, the US also imposed sanctions on Russian and Iranian officials and companies involved in the weapons transfers. They also identified “four vessels as blocked property that are enabling Iran’s delivery of weapons components and weapons systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and close-range ballistic missiles (CRBMs), to Russia,” the Treasury Department said in a press release Tuesday. Blinken said in a press conference earlier Tuesday that “in recent days” the US has “been sharing intelligence behind these findings, with our allies and partners and working together to ensure that there will be significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions.” “Anyone who proves assistance to Russia … is perpetuating the war, is perpetuating the conflict,” he added, noting that “we’ve warned Tehran publicly, we’ve warned Tehran privately, that taking this step would constitute a dramatic escalation.” “Dozens of Russian military personnel have been trained in Iran to use the FATH-360 close-range ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 75 miles. Russia has now received shipments of these ballistic missiles and will likely use them within weeks in Ukraine,” Blinken said alongside his British counterpart, David Lammy. Blinken said he expected Russia would begin using the missiles against Ukraine in the coming weeks. Blinken explained that Iranian missiles will give Russia an “additional capability” and “additional flexibility,” explaining that Russia will now be able to use their own arsenal to hit targets beyond the front lines while they use the short-range ballistic missiles from Iran to hit closer targets. Iran has already provided Russia with hundreds of drones that Russian forces have used in their war against Ukraine, and Russia has been building a drone-manufacturing facility in country with Iran’s help, CNN has reported. Iran has also trained Russia on how to use the drones. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani “strongly condemned the unusual statement of the Foreign Ministers of England, France and Germany regarding the cancellation of bilateral agreements for the provision of air services with the Islamic Republic of Iran and the sanctioning of Iran Air under the pretext of allegedly interfering in the conflict in Ukraine,” in a statement on Tuesday. “This action of the three European countries is the continuation of the hostile policy of the West and economic terrorism against the people of Iran, which will face the corresponding and proportionate action of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Kanani said. “As it was emphasized before, any claim that the Islamic Republic of Iran has sold ballistic missiles to the Russian Federation is completely baseless and false,” he added. “It adds to their capacity, and it fuels the war,” Blinken said of the new Iranian missiles Russia now has. “Anyone who is providing assistance to Russia, whether it’s direct lethal assistance like Iran or North Korea, whether it’s assistance to their defense industrial base, like China, is perpetuating the war, is fueling the conflict.” In return for the new missiles, Russia will provide Iran with technology “including on nuclear issues, as well as some space information,” Blinken said. He called the relationship a “two-way street.” “As Iran’s destabilizing activity spread, so does Russia, sowing even greater insecurity in their regions and around the world. In recent days, we’ve been sharing intelligence behind these findings, with our allies and partners and working together to ensure that there will be significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions,” Blinken said. The new sanctions include additional measures on Iran Air, the national airline, Blinken said. “Anyone who proves assistance to Russia … is perpetuating the war, is perpetuating the conflict,” he added. Lammy similarly called Iran’s actions “a troubling pattern” and “a significant escalation.” Blinken and Lammy said they would make a joint visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, later this week. Lammy described it as the “first joint visit of this kind for well over a decade.” CNN previously reported that the shipment of the Iranian missiles had arrived in Russia. Iranian officials have denied that they sent missiles to Russia.

Ukraine managed to shoot down 58 of the 67 Shahed drones launched by Russia, the Ukrainian Air Force said in a Telegram post on Saturday. The attack targeted multiple locations including the northeastern city of Sumy, the southern city of Kherson, the central region of Poltava and the capital of Kyiv. The head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhii Popko, described it as “another massive drone attack” on the city, in a post on his Telegram channel. At least one drone appeared to have been shot down over the Ukrainian parliament as pictures shared online by the parliament showed debris scattered outside the building’s entrance. Kyiv’s air defenses managed to shoot down all of the Russian drones which began approaching the city at around 3am local time (8pET), Popko said, with none of the drones managing to reach their targets.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been lobbying strongly in recent days for further air defenses for Ukraine in the face of a barrage of Russian attacks across the country. Addressing a forum in Italy on Friday, Zelensky highlighted how Russia has launched “missiles, attack drones, and heavy aircraft bombs” against Ukrainian cities and villages. “Big, small, it doesn’t matter for them,” he added. On September 1 and 2, the northeastern city of Kharkiv came under respective missile and bomb attacks. One day later, Russian forces carried out a missile strike on a military educational facility in the central city of Poltava, killing over 55 people. On September 4, the western city of Lviv, long considered to be largely safe from Russian attacks, was hit by a missile strike targeting civilian infrastructure, killing seven people.

He spent years on the Ukrainian front lines. He knows the price of a good smoke. As a battalion commander, Dima was in charge of around 800 men who fought in some of the fiercest, bloodiest battles of the war – most recently near Pokrovsk, the strategic eastern town that is now on the brink of falling to Russia. But with most of his troops now dead or severely injured, Dima decided he’d had enough. He quit and took another job with the military – in an office in Kyiv. Standing outside that office, chain smoking and drinking sweet coffee, he told CNN he just couldn’t handle watching his men die anymore. Two and half years of Russia’s grinding offensive have decimated many Ukrainian units. Reinforcements are few and far between, leaving some soldiers exhausted and demoralized. The situation is particularly dire among infantry units near Pokrovsk and elsewhere on the eastern front line, where Ukraine is struggling to stop Russia’s creeping advances. CNN spoke to six commanders and officers who are or were until recently fighting or supervising units in the area. All six said desertion and insubordination are becoming a widespread problem, especially among newly recruited soldiers. Vasyl Stus Lyceum of International Relations/Facebook Related article In Ukraine’s 'safe haven city', an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike Four of the six, including Dima, have asked for their names to be changed or withheld due to the sensitive nature of the topic and because they are not authorized to speak to the media. “Not all mobilized soldiers are leaving their positions, but the majority are. When new guys come here, they see how difficult it is. They see a lot of enemy drones, artillery and mortars,” one unit commander currently fighting in Pokrovsk told CNN. He also asked to remain anonymous. “They go to the positions once and if they survive, they never return. They either leave their positions, refuse to go into battle, or try to find a way to leave the army,” he added. Unlike those who volunteered earlier in the war, many of the new recruits didn’t have a choice in entering the conflict. They were called up after Ukraine’s new mobilization law came into force in the spring and can’t leave legally until after the government introduces demobilization, unless they get special permission to do so. A group of Ukrainian soldiers rests after completing a long mission in Russia's Kursk region. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Yet the discipline problems clearly began way before this. Ukraine went through an extremely difficult patch during last winter and spring. Months of delay in getting US military assistance into the country led to a critical ammunition shortage and a major slump in morale. Multiple soldiers told CNN at the time that they would often find themselves in a good position, with a clear view of the approaching enemy and no artillery rounds to fire. Some spoke of feeling guilty for not being able to provide adequate cover for their infantry units. “The days are long, they live in a dugout, on duty around the clock and if they can’t shoot, the Russians have an advantage, they hear them advancing and they know that if they had fired it wouldn’t have happened,” said Andryi Horetskyi, a Ukrainian military officer whose unit is now fighting in Chasiv Yar, another eastern frontline hot spot. Serhiy Tsehotskiy, an officer with the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, told CNN the unit tries to rotate soldiers in and out every three to four days. But drones, which have only increased in number over the course of the war, can make that too dangerous, forcing soldiers to stay put for longer. “The record is 20 days,” he said.

Fleeing is hard, even for those who can afford it As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops started to give up. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. More than a million Ukrainians serve in the country’s defense and security forces, although this number includes everyone, including people working in offices far away from the front lines. It’s a staggering and – most likely – incomplete number. Several commanders told CNN that many officers would not report desertion and unauthorized absences, hoping instead to convince troops to return voluntarily, without facing punishment. This approach became so common that Ukraine changed the law to decriminalize desertion and absence without leave, if committed for the first time. Horetskyi told CNN that this move made sense. “Threats will only make things worse. A smart commander will delay threats, or even avoid them,” he said. Pokrovsk has become the epicenter of the fight for Ukraine’s east. Russian forces have been inching towards the city for months, but their advances have sped up in recent weeks as Ukrainian defenses begin to crumble.

Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images ‘Everything feels the same’ Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear his goal is to gain control over the entirety of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and taking over Pokrovsk, an important military and supply hub, would be a major step towards that objective. It sits on a key road that connects it to other military cities in the area and a railroad that links it with Dnipro. The last major coking coal mine still under Kyiv’s control is also just to the west of the city, supplying coke to make steel – an indispensable wartime resource. Ukrainian soldiers in the area paint a grim picture of the situation. Kyiv’s forces are clearly outnumbered and outgunned, with some commanders estimating there are 10 Russian soldiers to each Ukrainian. But they also appear to be struggling with problems of their own making. An officer from a brigade fighting in Pokrovsk, who asked for their name to be withheld for security reasons, told CNN that poor communication between different units is a major issue there. CNN's Christiane Amanpour interviews Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi. Ivana Kottasová/CNN Related article Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion There have even been cases of troops not disclosing the full battlefield picture to other units out of fear it would make them look bad, the officer said. One battalion commander in northern Donetsk said his flank was recently left exposed to Russian attacks after soldiers from neighboring units abandoned their positions without reporting it. The high number of different units that Kyiv has sent to the eastern front lines has caused communication problems, according to several rank-and-file soldiers who were until recently fighting in Pokrovsk. One said it was not unheard of to have Ukrainian signal jammers affecting vital coordination and drone launches because units from different brigades didn’t communicate properly. A group of sappers – or combat engineers – spoke to CNN near the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Kursk region, where they have been recently redeployed from just south of Pokrovsk. Kyiv launched its surprise incursion into Kursk last month, taking Moscow by surprise and quickly advancing some 30 kilometers (19 miles) into Russian territory. Ukraine’s leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, said one of the goals of the operation was to prevent further attacks on northern Ukraine, while also showing Kyiv’s Western allies that, with the right support, the Ukrainian military can fight back and eventually win the war. The operation also gave a major boost to an exhausted nation. Ukraine has been on the backfoot for most of the past year, enduring relentless attacks, blackouts and heartbreaking losses.

Having just finished a long mission over the border, they were slumped around a table outside a closed restaurant near the frontier, waiting for their car to turn up. Chain smoking and trying to stay awake, they questioned why they were sent to Kursk when the eastern front line is in disarray. “It felt weird entering Russia, because in this war we were supposed to defend our soil and our country, and now we’re fighting on the other country’s territory,” one of them said. CNN is not disclosing their identities because they were not authorized to speak to the media and due to the sensitive nature of their words. All four have been fighting for more than two-and-half years and theirs is a tough job. As sappers, they spend days on the front lines, clearing mine fields, preparing defenses and conducting controlled explosions. They can find themselves under attack, ahead of even the first line of infantry, dragging around some 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of kit and four anti-tank mines, each weighing about 10 kilograms (22 pounds). Speaking to CNN, they appeared completely exhausted. They had no rest between their Pokrovsk mission and the one in Kursk. “It depends on each commander. Some units receive rotations and have time off, while others are just fighting non-stop, the whole system is not very fair,” one of the soldiers said. Asked if the advances in Kursk gave them the same boost as the rest of the nation, they remained skeptical. “After three years of this, war, everything feels the same,” one of the men told CNN. ‘Rotten approach’ Speaking to CNN on Thursday, Ukraine’s Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted low morale is still an issue and said raising it was “a very important part” of his job. “The Kursk operation… significantly improved the morale of not only the military but the entire Ukrainian population,” he said. He said he had been going to the front lines regularly to meet with the soldiers there and do what he could to make them feel better. “We understand each other no matter who I am talking to, whether it is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander or a battalion commander… I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience. The front line is my life,” he said. And Horetskyi – an officer specially trained to provide moral and psychological support to troops – is part of the plan to boost morale. During recent leave in Kyiv, Horetskyi told CNN that while his role has existed for a while, it consisted mostly of paperwork. Now he spends a lot more time with his unit, checking in, making sure they are not burning out. Not that his help is always appreciated. “They have this idea that I’m a shrink that will make them take thousands of tests and then tell them they are sick, so I try to break down the barriers,” he said, adding that little distractions can prevent a downward spiral. Andryi Horetskyi, an officer in charge of psychological support of the troops fighting on the front lines, pictured during a recent leave period in Kyiv. Ivana Kottasova/CNN In the monotony of war, any break from the routine can help, he said. This can include a wash in a real shower, a haircut or going for a swim in a lake. “It’s such a little thing, but it gets them out of the routine for half a day, it makes them happy, and they can return to their positions a bit more relaxed,”  Horetskyi explained. Even officers with many years of experience are finding the situation in the east difficult. Some, like Dima, are transferring to posts away from the front lines. He said his decision to leave the battlefield was mostly down to disagreements with a new commander. That, too, is increasingly common, several officers told CNN. The ranks of Dima’s battalion grew thinner and thinner, until the unit disappeared. They never received enough reinforcements, Dima says, something he blames squarely on the government and its reluctance to recruit more people. The battalion suffered painful losses in the past year, fighting on multiple front lines before being sent to Pokrovsk without any rest. Dima saw so many of his men killed and wounded, he became numb. Yet he told CNN he is determined to go back to the front lines, but will make one change first. “I’ve now made the decision that I will stop getting attached to people emotionally. It’s a rotten approach, but it’s the most sensible one,” he said."

A series of videos posted on social media, including on Telegram from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry on Wednesday, show the low-flying drones dropping torrents of fire – actually molten metal – onto Russian-held positions in tree lines. The white-hot mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide, called thermite, burns at temperatures up to 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 degrees Celsius). It can quickly burn off trees and vegetation giving cover to Russian troops, if not killing or disabling the troops outright. As it falls from the drone, the thermite resembles the fire coming from the mouth of the mythical dragon, giving the drones their nickname. “Strike Drones are our wings of vengeance, bringing fire straight from the sky!” a social media post from Ukraine’s 60th Mechanized Brigade said. “They become a real threat to the enemy, burning his positions with an accuracy that no other weapon can achieve,” the post continued. “When our ‘Vidar’ works – the Russian woman will never sleep,” it added. Vidar is the Norse god of vengeance. A Ukrainian drone drops an incendiary payload on Russian positions near Kharkiv. Khorne Group via Telegram Creating that kind of fear is likely the main effect of Ukraine’s thermite drones, according to Nicholas Drummond, a defense industry analyst specializing in land warfare and a former British Army officer. “It is very nasty stuff. Using a drone to deliver it is quite innovative. But used in that way its effect will have been psychological more than physical,” Drummond told CNN. “I understand that Ukraine only possesses a limited capacity to deliver a thermite effect, so this is a niche capability rather than new mainstream weapon,” he said. But he acknowledges the terror thermite can create. “I would not have liked to have been on the receiving end,” Drummond said. Incendiary weapons in war Thermite can easily burn through almost anything, including metal, so there’s little protection from it. It was discovered by a German chemist is the 1890s and was originally used to weld railroad tracks. But its military potency soon became apparent, with the Germans dropping it from zeppelins as bombs over Britain in World War I, according to a history from McGill University in Montreal. Both Germany and the Allies used thermite aerial bombs in World War II, and they also utilized it to disable captured artillery pieces, putting thermite into the breech and melting the weapon shut from the inside. A Ukrainian drone drops an incendiary believed to be molten metal thermite on Russian positions near Kharkiv Khorne Group via Telegram According to Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a British anti-war advocacy group, Ukraine has previously used thermite dropped from drones to permanently disable Russian tanks. The thermite is dropped “directly through the hatches, where the intense heat quickly ignites and destroys everything inside,” an AOAV report says. Obtained by CNN Related article Video footage appears to show Russians killing surrendering Ukrainian soldiers “This precision, combined with the drone’s ability to bypass traditional defenses, makes thermite bombs a highly effective tool in modern warfare,” it says. Thermite is just one type of incendiary weapon, with others including napalm and white phosphorus. The United Nations Office for Disarmament says incendiary weapons can cause massive destruction and environmental damage. “The fires produced by the weapon itself or ignited by it are difficult to predict and to contain. Therefore, incendiary weapons are often described as ‘area weapons’ due to their impact over a broad area,” it says on its website. The United States used napalm to burn much of Japan’s capital to the ground in World War II’s infamous Tokyo fire raids. US forces also used it extensively in Vietnam. The US military has also used thermite in grenades, with the US Army’s Pine Bluff Arsenal producing the weapons from the 1960s through 2014 and then resuming production again in 2023. What thermite does to humans Under international law, thermite is not banned for military combat, but its use on civilian targets is prohibited because of the horrible effects it can have on the human body. In a 2022 report on incendiary weapons, such as thermite, Human Rights Watch called them “notorious for their horrific human cost,” including inflicting fourth- or fifth-degree burns. “They can cause damage to muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and even bones,” HRW said. Treatment can last months and require daily attention. If victims survive, they are left with physical and psychological scars, HRW said. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow’s initial push into Ukraine was stopped far short of capturing the capital of Kyiv, and the sides have fought over much of the same territory for most of the war. Ukraine’s forces, outnumbered and outgunned by Russia, have proven adept at innovating with small drones to hammer Moscow’s troops and equipment. A Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory near Kursk in August surprised Putin and has boosted Ukrainian confidence that it can prevail in the war. Vegetations burns after a puported thermite drone attack near Kharkiv, Ukraine. Khorne Group via Telegram Kyiv has accused Russian forces of using unspecified incendiary munitions on civilian targets earlier in the war, including on a village outside of Kharkiv , Ukraine’s second-largest city, in May 2022. CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh went through that village, Cherkaski Tyshky, shortly after a Russian attack and described a scene of “homes, fields, even the air itself, torched.” Ukrainian officers also accused Russia of using incendiaries in attacks on the city of Bakhmut last year. Those uses of incendiaries haven’t led to quick victory for Russia, and Drummond doesn’t think they are a battlefield game changer for Ukraine either. “If Ukraine wants to achieve real impact, it needs sufficient mass to force a proper breakthrough as it has in Kursk. This is what victory looks like,” Drummond said. But thermite does give Russian troops another reason to be fearful of Ukrainian drones, he said. “We have seen instances where Russian forces attacked by multiple drones have deserted their positions. The more Ukraine can instill a fear of drones the better its chances of success,” he said. “Thermite keeps up the pressure.”"

CNN — The troops emerge and stagger into the middle of the dusty track, then onto their knees, their hands placed on their heads. Seconds later, the Ukrainian drone footage shows, they lie face down, motionless, dust trailing nearby. Video obtained exclusively by CNN, filmed during fighting late August near the embattled city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, shows an apparent execution by Russian troops of three surrendering Ukrainians, after their trench was overrun. The incident, described by a Ukrainian official who asked for some details to be withheld to protect the identity of the unit, is part of a pattern of apparent executions, seemingly increasing in pace this year. Ukrainian defense intelligence sources have given CNN a list of 15 cases since November, most supported by drone video or audio intercepts, in which they say surrendering Ukrainian troops were killed by the Russians on the front lines, rather than being taken prisoner. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, told CNN on Wednesday his office was investigating at least 28 such incidents since the start of the war. Following the publication of CNN’s report, Kostin posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that prosecutors had also launched an investigation into the footage obtained by CNN from near Pokrovsk, as well as video of another suspected killing of a captured Ukrainian soldier that was distributed Friday on Telegram. Ukrainian prosecutors said Friday they were now investigating “the possible execution of 73 Ukrainian prisoners of war by the Russian military.” The footage from Pokrovsk region appears to reflect the relentlessly brutal tactics of the Russian military as they continue to advance in Ukraine’s east. Drone footage from eastern Ukraine last month captures the moment three Ukrainian soldiers stagger onto a dusty track and kneel down, hands on their heads, seeking to surrender. Obtained by CNN Moscow’s grind towards the Ukrainian strategic military hub of Pokrovsk has continued, despite Kyiv’s recent gains in the Russian border region of Kursk fueling hopes the Kremlin would be forced to divert troops to defend Russia’s own borders. Ukrainian prosecutors told CNN they believe the alleged killings are war crimes and part of an orchestrated policy by the Kremlin. “If prisoners of war surrender, if they show that they surrender, if they are without weapons in their hands, then summary execution is a war crime,” Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, told CNN. The video shows all three men falling to the ground, killed by Russian forces rather than being taken prisoner, a Ukrainian official tells CNN. Obtained by CNN Kostin argued that such crimes had been committed in different areas of Ukraine, by a variety of units, giving Kyiv “an opportunity to claim that such policy could be (elevated) to crimes against humanity. This policy is orchestrated by Kremlin. It’s an order of specific commanders.” The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the allegations. The emergence of videos showing what appears to be a growing Russian tactic has presented a dilemma for Ukrainian commanders, who face the unenviable task of warning their troops and the world of Russian savagery, at the risk of sapping already drained Ukrainian morale. The Ukrainian official who provided the Pokrovsk drone footage said their unit was aware of multiple similar cases on the front lines that had not been publicized or investigated. Ukrainian soldiers are seen on a combat mission in the Pokrovsk direction, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, on August 13, 2024. Ukrinform/Shutterstock Some recent cases have been made public, with one unit in Toretsk claiming on Telegram it had drone video, which it published Tuesday, of three Ukrainian troops emerging from a basement, their hands raised in surrender, and then being gunned down by Russian troops. Prosecutors in the Donetsk region said they had opened an investigation into the “violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder.” Several Russian servicemen have been put on trial accused of such killings, including one in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian prosecutors allege the Russian was a convict, released from his sentence for theft in November to serve in the Russian military’s 127th motorised rifle division. Prosecutors have released drone footage supporting their claim the Russian shot a Ukrainian soldier in January as he emerged, arms raised, from his trench near Priyutne and then knelt. CNN has obtained another drone video, also from Zaporizhzhia region, showing how in May this year, near the heavily contested village of Robotyne, Russian troops told three Ukrainian soldiers to lie face down after their dugout was overrun. Ukraine’s defence intelligence has given CNN audio transcripts of intercepts of what it says was the order from a Russian commander, known as “Turk,” to his subordinate in the field, “Maloy,” to kill the prisoners. TURK: ⁠Take them f**king down, f***king zero them, zero them. MALOY:  ⁠Got it, copy. TURK:⁠  ⁠Once you zero them, report back. The drone video shows how, once all three Ukrainians are out of the trench and lying face down, the Russians fire. While Russian President Vladimir Putin is the subject of an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over his role in an alleged scheme to forcibly deport Ukrainian children to Russia, Kyiv is aggressively pursuing claims of genocide against Moscow. Kostin, the prosecutor general, suggested the systematic nature of these alleged battlefield executions meant they could become part of the wider genocide case. The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Dr. Morris Tidball-Binz, visited Ukraine in May at the invitation of Kyiv, in part to examine reports of extrajudicial killings in combat. A UN investigative source told CNN some of the apparent executions of Ukrainian soldiers had been subject to their examination. “There are many. There is a pattern. It suggests complacency, if not orders to give no quarter,” the source said, referring to the practice of showing no mercy. “The killings are war crimes individually,” the source said, “and together could amount to crimes against humanity.” This story has been updated."

Speaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany at the opening of the 24th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, Zelensky said the weapons systems were essential to hold back Russian forces . “I will not speak openly now about the number of systems they have received — thank you so much again — but the number of air defense systems that have not yet been delivered is significant,”  Zelensky said. “This is what was agreed upon, and this is what has not been fully implemented. The world has enough air defense systems to ensure that Russian terror does not have results, and I urge you to be more active in this war with us in air defense.” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking alongside Zelensky, said the Biden administration would announce another $250 million security assistance package for Ukraine. Since the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in June, he said, the US has committed more than $4 billion in new security assistance for Kyiv. Among the capabilities expected to be included in the aid package are 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, and spare equipment parts, according to a defense official. But Austin continued to resist Ukraine’s calls for approval to use long-range strike capability within Russia, telling reporters later on Friday that that there was “no one capability” that would be a game changer on the battlefield. The UDCG have met regularly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Zelensky’s in-person appearance added extra relevance to the latest gathering.

Ivana Kottasová/CNN Related article Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion Austin said Zelensky and the Ukrainian people had “inspired the world.” Friday’s meeting comes amid an increased push by Ukrainian leaders for the loosening of restrictions to use long-range weapons inside Russia. A week ago, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov presented a list of targets inside Russia to the Biden administration during a visit to Washington. Days later, Russia launched one of the deadliest single attacks since the beginning of the war, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 200 more in a strike on a military educational facility in central Ukraine. Last month Zelensky said he would be attending the United Nations General Assembly in September, where he would meet President Joe Biden. He added that the success of his so-called “plan for victory” largely depends on the US. But Austin said he did not discuss that plan with Zelensky when they spoke at Friday’s meeting. “We talked about a number of things, but that specific piece we didn’t discuss,” he told reporters. Canadian Minister of National Defense Bill Blair said Friday that his country supports Ukraine’s request to use long-range weapons on military targets inside Russia. “One of the things that President Zelensky and his ministers have made very clear to us is that they are suffering significant attacks from airbases and military installations located within Russia, that those attacks are aimed towards their cities, their citizenry, and their critical infrastructure,” Blair said. “And in order to properly defend themselves they have asked for permission to use long range fire capabilities that are being provided by the UDCG… I believe very sincerely that that will enable them to do a better job of protecting themselves.” And while the US has said that much of the high-value targets inside Russia, such as the aircraft launching glide bombs, are outside of the range of long-range weapons like ATACMS — which have been a primary request from Ukraine — Blair said Russia moving capabilities out of that range is a win in itself. “By moving them [glide bombs] further back, it’s made them less effective and has decreased the vulnerability of Ukraine’s cities and critical infrastructure,” he said. “And so if the Russians are being responsive to that potential threat, then I think that could be a very positive thing as well if it makes the Ukrainians’ situation more defensible and safer.” Vasyl Stus Lyceum of International Relations/Facebook Related article In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas also said that Lithuania supports the lifting of restrictions on long-range strike capabilities, and added that “many” other countries do as well, though he didn’t name them. He blamed “Russian propaganda” for concerns about escalating the fight in Russia if Ukraine were to get the approval to strike military targets in the country. “They are using it as a deterrence for more support to Ukraine, so I would recommend not to be convinced by this Russian propaganda and to do what we need to do to support Ukraine as much as possible,” he said. Austin noted that Kyiv was continuing to “seize the initiative on the battlefield,” a clear reference to Ukraine’s ongoing offensive in Russia’s Kursk region. “The Kremlin’s army of aggression is now on the defensive on its own turf,” Austin said. “But we know that Putin’s malice runs deep. Moscow continues its offensive in the east of Ukraine, especially around Pokrovsk. And Putin is repositioning his troops in Kursk. And the Kremlin continues to bombard Ukraine’s cities and to target Ukraine’s cities and to target Ukraine civilians.” “That’s an outrage,” he said. “But Ukraine refuses to bend.” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius added that he is “a little bit disappointed too” that more air defense systems haven’t yet made their way to Ukraine. “We agreed in Washington to deliver more Patriot systems, air defense systems of any kind,” he said, “and up until now they haven’t yet arrived in Kyiv.” On the sidelines of the meeting in Ramstein, Pistorius said Germany will deliver an additional 12 self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine.

Ukrinform/NurPhoto/Getty Images Related article Ukraine’s Zelensky says Russia incursion is part of victory plan he intends to show Biden In what is the most detailed explanation of the rationale behind the incursion, Syrskyi outlined the key objectives of the operation: to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a security zone and prevent cross-border shelling of civilian objects, to take prisoners of war and to boost the morale of the Ukrainian troops and the nation overall. Speaking to Amanpour at an undisclosed location near the frontline, the general, who took over as army chief in February, said Moscow moved tens of thousands of troops to Kursk, including some of its best airborne assault troops. And while admitting that Ukraine was under immense pressure in the area around Pokrovsk, the strategic city that has for weeks been the epicenter of war in eastern Ukraine, Syrskyi said his troops have now managed to stall the Russian advances there. “Over the last six days the enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. In other words, our strategy is working.” he said. “We’ve taken away their ability to maneuver and to deploy their reinforcement forces from other directions … and this weakening has definitely been felt in other areas. We note the amount of artillery shelling as well as the intensity of the offensive have decreased,” he said. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine army chief, pictured last year in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Yuriy Mate/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images ‘The frontline is my life’ Speaking to Amanpour just after inspecting the frontlines on Thursday, Syrskyi said that there’s no doubt that Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression. “The enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,” he said. But Syrskyi also said the fact that Russia has such a material advantage has forced Ukraine to become smarter and more efficient in the way it’s fighting the war. “We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures and also, to use technical superiority,” he said, highlighting Ukraine’s advanced drone program and other home-grown high-tech weaponry. Syrskyi was named Ukraine’s commander in chief in February, after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He took over at a particularly difficult time for Ukraine. The months-long delays in the delivery of US military assistance caused critical ammunition shortages. At the same time, Ukraine was struggling to replenish its troops, exhausted and diminished after fighting Russia’s relentless offensive for two years. Syrskyi said recruiting more soldiers was a priority. The Ukrainian government then passed a controversial mobilization law, requiring all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military and to carry their registration documents on them at all times – an effort to make the recruitment process more transparent and fair. Seven months later, the new recruits are arriving to the frontlines. But several commanders have told CNN that not all of the new soldiers are ready to fight and are routinely abandoning their positions. Syrskyi admitted his troops are heading to the battlefield after receiving less training than he’d like them to. “Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified professional military personnel,” he said. “At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible,” he added, explaining that new recruits get one month of basic military training followed by half a month to a full month of more specialized training before they are sent to fight.

Oleg Palchyk/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images Syrskyi told Amanpour that the delays in US military assistance did cause major setbacks on the battlefield and led to a slump in morale – something he admitted was still an issue. He said he takes frequent trips to the frontlines and makes sure he spends time with his troops. “We speak the same language … we understand each other no matter who I am talking to – whether this is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander, or a battalion commander,” he said. “I have been in this war since 2014,” he said, referring to Russia’s incursion into the Donbas 10 years ago. “In other words, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience,” he added. Syrskyi ended the candid interview by thanking Ukraine’s Western allies for their support. Switching from Ukrainian to English, he said: “Together we are stronger. Together we can win.”"

As Ukraine’s top diplomat, Kuleba has been a prominent fixture in Zelensky’s administration and one of the most public-facing, especially dealing with overseas officials. He was seen as a capable politician and a safe pair of hands, one of the strongest members of Zelensky’s cabinet. His offer to resign comes ahead of an expected visit by the president to the United States this month. Kuleba’s was the latest in a flurry of resignations. Two of Ukraine’s vice premiers, three ministers, the head of the State Property Fund and a top official in Zelensky’s Presidential Office have all quit within the last day or so. The parliament approved Kuleba’s resignation on Thursday and Andrii Sybiha was sworn in as foreign minister to replace him. Sybiha has previously served as ambassador to Turkey and deputy head of the presidential office. The resignations of the three other ministers and one of the vice premiers were approved on Wednesday. Video Ad Feedback Kuleba speaks to CNN day before tendering resignation 00:35 - Source: CNN Zelensky has not yet given any explanation for the reshuffle, but said in his nightly address on Tuesday that the coming fall will be “extremely important for Ukraine” and as such “our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need.” Kuleba and others who tendered their resignations are widely expected to be appointed into other roles in the Zelensky administration. The reshuffle comes at a precarious time for Ukraine. Its troops are under increasing pressure on the eastern frontlines, especially around the strategic city of Pokrovsk that is on the brink of falling to Russia. Reuters Related article Dozens killed in Russian strike on military educational facility in central Ukraine It seems likely that Zelensky wants to have his new team in place for his trip to the US later this month, where he is expected to attend the United Nation General Assembly and meet the US President Joe Biden. Zelensky said last week that he intends to present Biden with a new four-part “victory plan” – without providing details. The last major change Zelensky made to the top echelon of Ukraine’s leadership came in February, when he replaced the former Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with Oleksander Syrskyi. Zaluzhnyi currently serves as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Ukrainian political scientist Mykola Davydiuk said there were no major disagreements within the government. Instead, Zelensky is likely trying to send a signal that he is injecting new energy into his government. “(The president’s office) wanted to do this last fall, then in December, then in May. They spoke about it so they need to do something, otherwise people will not believe them,” he said, adding that Zelensky likely sensed a window of opportunity for the reshuffle. “The West can’t criticize him now because they have a lot of domestic issues to deal with – the US election, election trouble in Germany and France,” he added. Davyd Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine’s parliament, said Tuesday that there would be major changes expected in the cabinet this week. “As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50% of the Cabinet of Ministers’ staff will be changed,” Arakhamia said on Telegram, adding that new members would be appointed imminently. Among those who have resigned was the Minister for Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin, who was in charge of weapons production. He is expected to assume another defense role, Reuters reported. The resignations also include the justice, environment and reintegration ministers. “To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government… I am also counting on a slightly different weight for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy,” Arakhamia said. Speaking to CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour Tuesday, Kuleba said he expects Putin to continue increasing air attacks on Ukraine before winter sets in. “Putin still has the same purpose to freeze people, to destroy our economy and this is his strategy. So I’m afraid he will continue with his barrage of missile and drone attacks over the course of the autumn,” he said. The attacks, Kuleba said, are “just another reason why delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine must be expedited.” Emergency workers carry the body of a person killed during a Russian drone and missile strike in Lviv, Ukraine on September 4, 2024. Roman Baluk/Reuters Missiles hit Lviv The expected reshuffle came as Russian missiles continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities. Just a day after two ballistic missiles hit an educational facility in Poltava in central Ukraine, a major attack struck Lviv , a city in western Ukraine that has long been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country. Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed and 25 were injured in the attacks. A 15-month-old child suffered “moderate” injuries and four other children have minor injuries, according to the head of the city’s regional military administration Maksym Kozytskyi. Vasyl Stus Lyceum of International Relations/Facebook Related article In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike Lviv, in Ukraine’s far west, is generally far away from Russian borders, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach it – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down. Many people from eastern regions relocated there to seek safety. Kozytskyi said that at least seven “architectural monuments of local importance,” including houses located in a historic part of the city and inside a UNESCO buffer zone, were also damaged in the attack. On Tuesday, a Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 54 people and injured nearly 300 others, according to the state emergency service of Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday it shot down 22 attack drones and seven cruise missiles. At the same time, Ukraine is still reeling from a massive wave of attacks against the energy infrastructure last week. Power cuts are still impacting lives across Ukraine, with millions suffering from power cuts every day.

The strike on Kryvyi Rih appears to be part of a wave of Russian attacks targeting hotels. Facilities in Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and another one in Kryvyi Rih were all hit by strikes in the past week or so. Speaking about the attacks, Zelensky again appealed for Kyiv’s allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses and to lift restrictions on the use of western weapons on targets in Russia. Nuclear power plant worries Meanwhile, the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the situation at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was “very fragile.” The Ukrainian energy company Energoatom said one of two power supply lines to the plant was damaged on Monday following Russian strikes in the region. “Today we have one of the two existing power lines down, which means that the station is again on the verge of being on a blackout,” Grossi told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday, before heading to Zaporizhzhia. Explaining why a power cut could cause a serious accident at the plant, Grossi said: “Blackout, no power… No power, no cooling… No cooling, maybe you have a disaster.” This story has been updated."

Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday. According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said. It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place. Yaroslav Bazylevych is the only remaining member of the family-of-five. Andriy Sadovyi/Telegram The deaths of the three sisters and their mother caused a huge outpouring of grief among people in Lviv and across Ukraine. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said the eldest girl, Yaryna, worked in the town hall as part of the “Lviv - Youth Capital of Europe 2025” initiative. Daryna, the middle sister, was a scholarship student of Ukrainian culture at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. She had just began her second year. “This is a great and irreparable loss. There are no words that can describe this grief. Let us pray for the souls of the innocent victims. Let us pray for Yaroslav, the father,” the university said in a statement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said preliminary information indicated two ballistic missiles hit the facility in the city of Poltava and a nearby hospital on Tuesday morning. “We say again and again to everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not somewhere in a warehouse,” Zelensky said in a statement. The head of the Poltava region military administration, Filip Pronin, announced the latest death toll on Telegram, adding that that rescue crews continue to clear and search through the debris at the site. Pronin said authorities believe up to 18 more people may be under the rubble. At least 10 residential buildings were also damaged in Poltava, he said. Moscow has not commented on the attack, but a well-known Russian military blogger Vladimir Rogov reported earlier on Tuesday that Russia struck a military school in Poltava. Speaking about the attack, President Zelensky repeated his call on Ukraine’s Western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses and lift restrictions on his country’s military using their weapons to strike inside Russia. “Long-range strikes that can protect against Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he added. ‘We will never forget this’ Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the missile reached the target in a very short period of time. People were struck down as they were trying to get into the bomb shelter, officials said. “The only way to intercept them was to have the Patriot system or a SAMP/T air defense system because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles,” said Kuleba, who added that he originally came from the Poltava region. Ukraine has received a handful of Patriot air defense systems from the United States and Germany, although Kyiv has consistently said the number was insufficient to allow it to effectively defend itself. The Biden administration said in June it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival.” But Kuleba made it clear on Tuesday that new weapons cannot come soon enough. “I don’t know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made,” Kuleba added, reiterating Zelensky’s calls for more defense systems to be sent to Ukraine. Local authorities said Tuesday was a “terrible day for Poltava” and declared three days of mourning. No more details would be released about the strike due to “security issues,” they said. Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, described the attack as a “terrible tragedy for the whole of Ukraine,” as Western allies condemned the scale and force of the Russian strike. “My deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the Russian missile attack on Poltava,” Zelenska said. “Russia is taking away our most valuable asset – our lives. We will never forget this.” British Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid tribute to those killed, in a post on X. “Russia’s strikes on Poltava are the latest sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. “We stand with Ukraine.” This story has been updated.

The short videos show plumes of smoke rising from targets in Moscow and the neighboring Tver region. The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged the size of the Ukrainian attack, but downplayed its effectiveness, saying Sunday that 158 Ukrainian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) “were destroyed and intercepted by on-duty air defense” overnight in 15 regions, including over the capital. A view shows an explosion caused by a drone that hit the Moscow oil refinery in Moscow, Russia September 1, 2024, in this screengrab from a social media video obtained by Reuters. Obtained by Reuters Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said two drones were shot down in the area of the Moscow Oil Refinery. No casualties were reported, but the second downed drone damaged a technical building at the refinery and caused a fire, which the mayor said had been localized and did not affect the plant’s operation. The Tver region’s governor, Igor Rudenya, said on social media that a fire caused by the drone attack on the Konakovo district has been extinguished and that gas and electricity services to the area were operating normally. The Ukrainian drone strikes follow others in the past week, including one last Thursday that set fire to oil reservoirs at a refinery in the Rostov region of Russia, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Social media video geolocated by CNN showed a large cloud of black smoke billowing from the Atlas oil depot in Rostov following the strike. The recent wave of Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory began last month, when Kyiv’s troops launched a cross-border incursion into the Kursk region on August 6. Just on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that “people are going through tough ordeals, especially in the Kursk region,” as Ukrainian forces attempt to “destabilize the situation along the border.” But the attack has not stifled Russia’s offensive in the eastern Donbas region, added Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the Kursk offensive is going “according to plan,” but admitted “difficulty” in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. Rostov Oil Fire Telegram Zelensky said the most recent drone assaults deep inside Russia were justified by Moscow’s repeated attacks on his country. “Just in the past week, Russia has launched over 160 missiles of various types, 780 guided aerial bombs, and 400 strike UAVs of different kinds against our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X . On Monday, at least three people were wounded by strikes in Kyiv, as well as the eastern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, according to Ukrainian authorities. Those came after 41 people were injured following a Russian attack on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local authorities said. “Russia is once again terrorizing Kharkiv, striking civilian infrastructure and the city itself,” Zelensky said on X, calling on allies to “give Ukraine everything it needs to defend itself.” An apartment building was hit by the latest round of Russian air strikes in Kharkiv. Vitalii Hnidyi/Reuters Related article Ukraine’s Zelensky fires Air Force chief, days after fatal F-16 crash “It is entirely justified for Ukrainians to respond to Russian terror by any means necessary to stop it,” Zelensky said, reiterating his call for Western countries to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, which have that prevented their use to hit targets inside Russia. “This includes decisions to carry out long-range strikes on Russia’s missile launch sites, destroy Russian military logistics, and conduct joint efforts to shoot down missiles and drones – everything that will help us resist Russian evil,” Zelensky said. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with missile and drone attacks since its invasion. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told CNN last week that he has presented the Biden administration with a list of targets inside Russia that Kyiv wants to hit with US-supplied long-range weapons, including the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). Fired from mobile launchers, ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) and can deploy single high-explosive warheads or up to 900 submunitions, according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also urged allies to “abandon baseless fears” and “lift restrictions on the country’s legitimate right to self-defense.” “Ukraine is forced to fight with hands tied behind its back,” Kuleba said on Monday.

But a US official said many of Ukraine’s high-value targets in Russia are outside the range of ATACMS. Russia’s military has pulled its high-value military assets far away from the front lines, including the aircraft launching glide bombs that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian targets. Umerov has pushed back on the assessments, saying Ukraine has presented the US a list of targets they would use ATACMS to strike. An analysis last month from a Washington-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), supported Ukrainian claims there are high-value targets inside Russia within range of ATAMCS. ISW said it had identified 233 Russian targets – “large military bases, communications stations, logistics centers, repair facilities, fuel depots, ammunition warehouses, and permanent headquarters” – in range of ATACMS that are immobile assets, meaning Moscow cannot move them out of harm’s way. And ISW said Ukraine would only need to use ATACMS to strike some of those targets to have a significant impact on Russia’s ability to fight on the front lines. While it pushes for the US to lift the ATACMS restrictions, Ukraine has been developing new longer-range indigenous weapons.

Russian forces conducted Friday’s “massive bombardment” of the city using Su-34 fight jets that were deployed from the border Belgorod region, according to the head of the Kharkiv regional prosecutor’s office, Oleksandr Filchakov. The 500 kilogram (1,100 lb) guided aerial bombs were launched from Russian territory and are very difficult to intercept, according to Ukrainian officials. “This is a bomb with a control module, which means that the enemy was specifically targeting residential infrastructure,” the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said Saturday. Striking the airplanes that carry those bombs is the most effective way to prevent such attacks, Zelensky has argued, as he continues to urge the United States and Western partners to lift restrictions on using long-range weapons to hit military targets on Russian territory. The guided aerial bombs hit civilian infrastructure in four districts of the city in the Friday afternoon attack, Filchakov said, adding that 82 apartment buildings, 11 private houses, three administrative buildings, two educational establishments, 47 shopping facilities, 57 cars, two warehouses, 10 garages and an enterprise facility were damaged. In the strike Saturday, the Russian military used a guided FAB-500 bomb, which damaged about 20 houses, the regional prosecutor’s office said. “A woman who was in the immediate epicenter of the explosion was killed, as well as her neighbor,” it said. Meanwhile, civilian evacuations continue in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces aim to take control of the strategic town of Pokrovsk. The town serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military because of its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center. Ukraine uses the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties. Over the last three days, 86 children have been evacuated from Kostiantynivka and nearby areas along with their parents as Russian shelling intensifies, regional officials said Saturday. There were nearly 2,130 children living in the community prior to the mandatory evacuation. Children and their parents are being taken out by armored vehicles from settlements located less than 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles) from the front line, according to Ukraine’s National Police. “We didn’t even think about leaving. We didn’t want to leave what we have. We are leaving because of the children, to keep them safe,” one of the evacuated mothers said. At least one person has been killed in Kostiantynivka and at least 11 injured over the past week, according to police. Ukrainian officials say that Russia specifically targeted civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv.

In addition to the casualties in Kharkiv, Russian attacks on Ukrainian territory have killed at least three people and injured 16 over the past 24 hours, according to officials.

Zelensky said the command level of the Air Force needed to “strengthen,” but did not say whether his decision to sack Oleshchuk was related to the F-16 crash on Monday. “I am infinitely grateful to all our military pilots, engineers, soldiers of mobile fire groups, air defense units. To everyone who really fights for Ukraine. And it is necessary also at the command level: We must strengthen. And protect people. Protect personnel. Take care of all our soldiers,” the Ukrainian leader said in his nightly address on Friday. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kryvonozhka will serve as acting Air Force commander, he said. Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov denied that Oleshchuk’s firing was connected to the death of the pilot. “I would probably say this is a rotation,” said Umerov in an interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt on “The Situation Room.” “This is two separate issues… at this stage, I would not connect them,” he said, calling the pilot’s death “unfortunate” and that Ukraine is investigating what happened. Ukraine’s air defenses have been under intense pressure, with Russia pummeling its neighbor with aerial assaults. F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes, known as “Moonfish,” was killed in the crash while “repelling the biggest ever aerial attack” by Russia against Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian military source. His death was a particularly hard blow for Ukraine; the first F-16s only arrived in the country earlier this month and Moonfish was one of the few pilots trained to fly them. The Ukrainian Defense Forces do not believe pilot error was behind the incident, the source added. Earlier on Friday, Zelensky cited recent attacks to again press Western countries to step up their military support for Ukraine. A deadly strike in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday “would not have happened if our Defense Forces had the ability to destroy Russian military aircraft where they are based. We need strong decisions from our partners to stop this terror,” he said.

Ukraine’s army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Friday that Kyiv’s forces have made further advances in their incursion into Russia’s western Kursk region, pushing up to two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) further into the border region over the past 24 hours. Syrskyi relayed the information during a staff meeting, in which Zelensky added that the replenishment of the “exchange fund” of forces was “extremely important for strengthening our positions.” The Ukrainian offensive and the Russian aerial response have distracted attention from the ground campaign in eastern Ukraine, but Syrskyi said fighting “of varying intensity” was continuing along the entire front line.

The enemy is trying to break through the defenses of our troops, but as of this morning all attacks have been repelled, the enemy has not succeeded,” he said. Russian forces have been pushing hard to capture Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, even as Moscow struggles to contain the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region. The front line has moved so close to Pokrovsk that the fighting was audible in the city center, according to a CNN team that reported from the town earlier this week. Pokrovsk, a strategic target for Moscow, sits on a key supply road that connects the town with other military hubs, and forms the backbone of Ukrainian defenses in the part of Donetsk region that is still under Kyiv’s control. Fierce fighting is also ongoing in the town of Karlivka, about 30 kilometers (or 18.6 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. “Today the enemy is actively trying to enter Karlivka. The fighting is ongoing right now, there are many of them,” a serviceman of Ukraine’s 59th brigade told CNN on Friday. The Russian forces don’t have control over the town yet, he said, “but the situation is difficult. ” Long-range weapons use Speaking with CNN, Umerov said the Biden administration was still considering his request, repeated Friday in his meetings with administration officials including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, for the US to lift restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons to strike deeper inside Russian territory. “We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,” said Umerov. Umerov pushed back against an assessment from a US official to CNN that many of Ukraine’s high value targets in Russia are outside the range of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). “We are showing that the airfields that they are using to hit our cities are within the range of deep strikes,” said Umerov. Asked about whether Ukraine was aiming to trade the Russian territory it has captured in Kursk for territory Russia has captured in Ukraine, Umerov said Ukraine was more focused on the “capabilities” that territory allows them. “We are focused to increase our capabilities to withstand, to repel the Russians from the temporary occupied territories,” said Umerov.

The last time Cielo Imbachí heard from her husband was more than 40 days ago, while he was on a layover in the Venezuelan capital Caracas. At the time, Jose Aron Medina was on his way back to Colombia after spending around nine months in Ukraine, she says. He never made it home. On Friday, Medina and his friend, fellow Colombian Alexander Ante, appeared in a video released by the Russian Federal Security Service, which accused them both of “participating in hostilities on the side of Ukraine against the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as mercenaries.” The Colombians were carrying “documents confirming their illegal activities,” said the FSB statement, and clothing with the insignia of the Ukrainian Carpathian Sich battalion. State TV channel Russia 1 reported that Ante and Medina were in Venezuela when they were detained and extradited to Russia. Their detention in Moscow was ordered by the city’s Lefortovsky District Court on August 28 and they are being held until October 22, the court’s press service told state news agency TASS. The two men’s detention and apparent extradition highlight the strong economic and military ties Russia has with Venezuela while also serving as a warning to foreign fighters, estimated to number in the thousands , who flocked to help Ukraine in the war effort. Reached for comment by CNN, Ukraine’s International Legion said it does not provide any information about potential, current, future, or former servicemen. It said it is reaching out “to other units where Colombians are serving,” adding that the “whole story sounds weird and unlikely.” This image taken on August 4 shows a Ukrainian Air Force's F-16 fighter jet flying in an undisclosed location in Ukraine.

And we just saw the videos of him in a Moscow court,” Imbachí told CNN. “Venezuela just took them and deported them to Russia, and we don’t understand the reason why they were deported,” she said. Venezuela’s foreign minister did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. A Colombian government source told CNN its foreign ministry is waiting for official reports from the consulates in Caracas and Moscow to understand how best to assist the pair. The ministry also told CNN that it has requested and is awaiting more information from Moscow through diplomatic channels. ‘We are desperate’ Imbachí and Medina, 36, have a nine-year-old daughter and a son from her previous marriage. Both men, Medina and Ante, come from the western Colombian city of Popayán, and they live close to each other, she said. Imbachí said her husband left for Ukraine last November, joining Ante who was already there. Medina decided to return home this July. She said he flew from Warsaw in Poland to Madrid, Spain, and then onwards to Venezuela. His destination was Popayán. It remains unclear why the two men traveled through Venezuela, as there are several direct flight options between Spain and Colombia. Traveling through Venezuela is difficult due to sanctions imposed by the United States against the Latin American country. The 'Phalanx' unit walks through Vuhledar.

A missing-person flyer from Colombia’s attorney general, with photos of the two men, said that their last known location was a Venezuelan airport on July 18 where they were seen “wearing camouflaged clothing from the Ukrainian Army.” Imbachí and Colombian congressman Jose Uscategui went to the Venezuelan embassy in Colombia’s capital Bogota on July 26 to “make a formal request for the safe return of these individuals to their home,” according to a tweet from Uscategui.

But as it relates to long-range strike, deep strikes into Russia, our policy has not changed,” said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday. Ukraine only has a limited supply of US-provided long-range missiles, and the US has made it clear that Kyiv should not expect another significant delivery of ATACMS because of the finite number in US inventories and the long production time of the weapon, according to a US official. Speaking before the meeting between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Umerov, the US official said many of Ukraine’s high value targets in Russia are outside the range of ATACMS. Russia’s military has pulled its high value military assets far away from the front line, including the aircraft launching glide bombs that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian targets. But Umerov pushed back on such assessments, saying Ukraine has presented the US a list of targets they would use ATACMS to strike. “We are showing that the airfields that they are using to hit our cities are within the range of deep strikes,” Umerov said on CNN. Ukraine has used its existing supply of ATACMS to target high-value Russian assets in occupied Crimea, including air defenses, ammo depots and airfields. The entire Crimean Peninsula falls within range of ATACMS, making it a prime area to use the US-manufactured missile, the US official said. Umerov said Ukraine is pushing to lift the ATACMS restrictions to protect Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. “They’re killing our citizens. That’s why we want to deter them, we want to stop them, we don’t want [to] allow their aviation to come closer to our borders to bomb the cities,” said Umerov. The US remains focused on critically needed air defenses, which the Biden administration has provided in nearly every military aid package. The US has also placed Ukraine at the top of the priority list for air defenses, the US official said, diverting $2 billion in air defense assets to Kyiv that was originally slated to go to other countries. Umerov also denied that the firing of the Ukrainian Air Force commander was connected to the death of one of Ukraine’s top pilots when a US-made F-16 fighter jet crashed just days earlier. “I would probably say this is a rotation,” said Umerov “This is two separate issues… at this stage, I would not connect them.” Zelensky did not say whether his decision to fire Mykola Oleshchuk was related to the F-16 crash on Monday, but said the command level of the Air Force needed to “strengthen.” Umerov called the death of the pilot “unfortunate” and said that Ukraine is investigating what happened. “We’re analyzing what has happened,” said Umerov. “We’ve also opened this file to our partners so they are also analyzing this and investigating along with us.” With all eyes on the Ukrainian incursion into the Russian oblast of Kursk, Umerov said Ukraine is more focused on the “capabilities” that area allows them rather than holding the Russian territory to trade for land Russia has captured from Ukraine. “We are focused to increase our capabilities to withstand, to repel the Russians from the temporary occupied territories,” said Umerov. Ukraine’s top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Friday that Ukrainian forces have advanced up to two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) further into Kursk over the last 24 hours. “Over the [past] day, our troops advanced up to 2 kilometers in some areas, taking control of 5 square kilometers of the territory,” Syrskyi told Zelensky and other officials in a staff meeting. But as Ukraine pushes further into Kursk, Russian forces are slowly gaining ground in eastern Ukraine, inching toward the city of Pokrovsk, a strategic city that sits on a key supply road between military hubs. The city forms the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses in the area, a valuable prize for the Russian military, but one the Kremlin is pursuing at an extremely high cost. The US official said Russia is suffering 1,000 casualties a day as they grind forward in eastern Ukraine, the highest casualty rate of the conflict. Zelensky has said he intends to show President Joe Biden a plan for victory at the United Nations General Assembly in September, as well as to presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump."

Pilot Oleksiy Mes, known as “Moonfish,” was killed in the crash while “repelling the biggest ever aerial attack” by Russia against Ukraine, said the source, adding that the pilot was buried on Thursday. The crash is being investigated and international experts will be invited to participate in the probe, the source added. The General Staff of Ukraine’s army said later on Thursday that several F-16 jets were deployed alongside anti-aircraft missile units to fight the Russian attack. “During the approach to the next target, communication with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died,” the General Staff said in the update.

Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images Related article Ukraine confirms F-16s have arrived in country as Zelensky heralds ‘new chapter’ in fight against Russia The death of the pilot is a major blow for Ukraine. The first F-16s only arrived in the country earlier this month and Moonfish was one of the few pilots trained to fly them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that the Ukrainian Air Force used the F-16 to destroy missiles and drones launched by Russia on Monday, the first time any Ukrainian official confirmed the jets were being used in combat. Kyiv waited a long time to get hold of the F-16s, and Zelensky has been asking its Western allies for the fighter jets since the start of the full-scale invasion. But as with other equipment, Western countries hesitated before finally agreeing to provide F-16s. The Netherlands and Denmark pledged to provide them early summer in 2023, but it took another few weeks for the United States to green-light the transfer. When they arrived earlier this summer, Zelensky said he and his government held “hundreds of meetings and negotiations” to secure the jets. A group of Ukrainian pilots started their F-16 training in the US in the fall. While it can take years to get fully trained up to fly the planes, Moonfish and others had to do it in six months. Ukraine is hoping the F-16 will give it a much-needed boost. The jets are multi-role: they can provide air cover for troops, attack ground targets, take on enemy planes and intercept missiles. With the right armament, F-16s could deter Russian fighter-bombers from approaching the battlefield. Still, the jets are no silver bullet. Ukraine can use them to deny Russia control over the skies, but experts say their capabilities are inferior to the most modern Russian combat aircraft that would likely prevail in an air battle with the F-16. Oleksiy Mes known as “Moonfish” was one of a few Ukrainian pilots trained to fly the F-16 fighter jets. CNN Moonfish: Top pilot who lobbied hard for F-16 Moonfish and another pilot Andriy Pilshchikov, known by the call sign “Juice,” became the faces of Ukraine’s campaign to get the F-16s. It was an uphill battle, but Juice and Moonfish pulled through it together. They were young and enthusiastic, spoke good English and were willing to fight to get the US jets into Ukrainian skies. Flying the F-16 was their dream and when Juice died in a plane crash during a combat mission last August, Moonfish made it his goal to fulfill it.

But when Juice died, Moonfish had to take his place. In a rare interview with CNN, he admitted that if Juice were alive, he’d be giving interviews. A man of few words, passionate about his job, he had his emotions under control. A straight talker who knew everything about F-16s. “Andriy was the ‘ideas man’ and the main driving force behind it all,” Moonfish said. “And I feel responsible to him for ensuring these planes arrive.” Speaking to CNN while in training, he said it was necessary for him and other Ukrainian pilots to undergo a truncated version of the training. “We would have had a lot of time to study the jet completely in peacetime, but we do not have the time,” he said. In a statement issued later on Thursday, the Ukrainian Air Force said Moonfish destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack drone on Monday, before he was killed in the crash.

Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, will meet with US officials “to try to concretely convince the White House to lift restrictions on long-range weapons strikes on Russian territory,” the lawmaker said. “They will provide a list of priority targets, without which it will be difficult to change the course of the war in Ukraine’s favor.” Umerov will meet Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday, US officials told CNN. It’s unclear who Yermak will meet. In previous visits to Washington, he has met Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Politico first reported that a list will be presented. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky once again called for allowing Ukraine to carry out strikes deeper inside Russia and “lifting the restrictions on long-range strikes for Ukraine now,” arguing it would end the war sooner “for Ukraine and the world as a whole.” Ukraine is making a concerted push to pressure the US ahead of the presidential election in November with Kiev concerned that a victory for former President Donald Trump could mean the US would withdraw support its war effort. The visit comes after Ukraine launched a surprise offensive into Russian territory earlier this month. The o peration in the Kursk region has so far been limited to a box the US drew in Russia to which the use of American weaponry would be limited, even as one US official acknowledged earlier this month the offensive was “not what we had in mind.” Kyiv has repeatedly pushed to use American and Western weapons to strike targets deeper in Russia, especially as the Russian military has moved its high value assets, such as military aircraft and control nodes, farther from the front lines. ‘No difference how deep the targets are’ “We consider strikes deep into Russian territory with American weapons no more provocative than strikes with American weapons on Russian territory near the border,” the Ukrainian lawmaker told CNN. “Both are Russian territory and it makes no difference how deep the targets are.” Instead, Ukraine has used its long-range US weapons, such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), to take out advanced Russian air defenses inside occupied Crimea. Previously, the US has allowed Ukraine to use American weaponry to strike Russian forces near the border as Kyiv defended itself against cross-border attacks. Russia launched a new offensive in the Kharkiv region in May, but after seizing some new territory, Ukraine was able to slow advancing Russian forces, particularly as the Biden administrated eased some restrictions on the use of US weapons. But the Biden administration has refused to allow Ukraine to use US weapons for long-range strikes deep into Russian territory. “You’ve heard us say that the Ukrainians can use US security assistance to defend themselves from cross-border attacks, in other words counter-fire,” said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday. “But as it relates to long-range strike, deep strikes into Russia, our policy has not changed.” A senior US official told CNN the Biden administration welcomes the engagement as it works to get a better understanding of Ukraine’s strategy and how the incursion could change the nature of the conflict. Given Ukraine’s difficulty recruiting and training soldiers, the US had expected that such a move would not have been possible for Zelensky to carry out until the spring. Zelensky said publicly at a conference in Ukraine that the incursion is the first step of a multi-phase effort described as a “powerful package of forcing Russia to end the war in a diplomatic way,” according to a translation of his remarks. Zelensky referenced a broader vision for an endgame – and plans to reveal that vision in September to Biden, Harris and, possibly Trump – an approach that also seemed to take the White House by surprise. “We need to hear from him directly,” a senior US official told CNN. “He was in public discussing the terms of an endgame … that’s the type of (private) conversation that would be helpful to have.” Biden last spoke to Zelensky on August 23 – and released a new tranche of military aid – in the leadup to Ukraine’s Independence Day. The Ukrainian seizure of Russian land in Kursk earlier this month injected a fresh wrinkle of uncertainty in what had become a grinding war of attrition with only small incremental gains apparently possible for either side. Putin facing difficult decisions While US officials expect that Russian President Vladimir Putin will eventually mount a counteroffensive to retake Kursk, the “expectation is that that will be a difficult fight for the Russians,” CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said on Wednesday. That may force Russia to make some difficult decisions about where it allocates troops that could create manpower challenges for him along the frontline in Ukraine – even as Ukraine may have to contend with precisely the same issue in order to hold Kursk, as it now appears committed to doing for at least a period of time. One US military official in the region said that Russia will likely need a three-to-one ratio to eject the Ukrainians, a critical mass of forces that will likely take Moscow at least three weeks to put together. Multiple US and western officials told CNN that there is no sense that the Ukrainian offensive crossed any kind of “red line” for the Russian president that might cause him to take dramatic action outside of the bounds of convention warfighting, like using a tactical nuke, for example. Still, although its impact is yet unknown, the fight for Kursk could have a potentially significant impact on the overall strategic outcome of the war, Cohen and others said. Putin “is not only going to have to face the fact that there is a front line now within Russian territory that he’s going to have to deal with,” Cohen said. “He has to deal with reverberations back in his own society that they have lost a piece of Russian territory.” Recent analysis from the open-source intelligence firm Filter Labs found that sentiment on Russia social media towards Putin has been “deteriorating” since the Ukrainian seizure of Kursk. But longtime Russia watchers point out that Putin has faced popularity hits before in the face of significant “embarrassments” – the Ukrainian sinking of the Moskva, or Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march on Moscow, for example – and he has not been forced or persuaded to change course in Ukraine."

It is perhaps the fastest moment of change in the conflict since it began, and heralds Kyiv throwing everything it has down on the table to try and bring palpable results before the US election alters its fate, maybe irrevocably. Since the surprise invasion of Russia’s Kursk region in early August, Ukraine’s risk tolerance has rocketed. Its top brass unveiled Tuesday it had taken 100 Russian settlements, as reports emerged of its forces trying to break into Belgorod region too. The shock incursion is now turning into a longer-term project, although Kyiv insists it is a buffer zone it seeks, and not a revenge occupation. It is remarkable how powerless the Kremlin appears to be to halt Ukraine’s progress, now three weeks in, despite having diverted 30,000 troops in that direction, according to a Ukrainian assessment given during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s annual news conference Tuesday. But this bold move has company. The past months have seen Ukraine targeting Russia’s deepest infrastructure at will. Airfields. Oil refineries. Ammunition hubs. All daily. A Ukrainian drone attack last Wednesday seemed to get close to Murmansk, the northern naval hub on the Arctic circle, where much of Moscow’s nuclear submarine force is based, according to a local Russian official. This Wednesday, flights were reportedly interrupted in Kazan, a city east of Moscow halfway to the Urals, after another apparent drone threat. The reach of Kyiv’s drones is a complication unimaginable to Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2022 when he was told his war of choice would see his forces in Kyiv in a matter of days. Billowing smoke is not uncommon in Russia’s western and southern regions now. At some point, Moscow’s increased vulnerability, and the vast damage itself, will pierce the sanitary cordon of what state media allows to be said. Ukrainian servicemen ride a military vehicle near the Russian border in Ukraine's Sumy region on August 11, 2024. Viacheslav Ratynskyi/Reuters Zelensky also let slip that another new capability has had an impact: the newly arrived NATO F-16 fighter jets , which he opaquely said had intercepted Russian missiles this week. This step change in Kyiv’s abilities to project air power will only grow in the months ahead and stymie Russia’s singular, long-term advantage – control of the skies and the ability to bomb at will. Moscow has responded to attacks on its territory and infrastructure with the only way it has known – in strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, hotels, and civilian targets, in horrifying waves night after night. Bu the numbers of dead have been relatively small and those of interceptions large, Kyiv has insisted. And while Zelensky appears to be throwing all he can into the fight, Putin seems stuck peddling a familiar tune. The Kremlin is casting the Kursk debacle as if it were a natural disaster, some analysts have noted. The billowing smoke is something local officials must extinguish but Putin seems able to mostly ignore. Moscow talks of foreign mercenaries assisting Kyiv while its missiles target Western journalists in a Donetsk hotel. It may be clumsy and ignorant as a response, but Russia’s wider aim remains unchanged and in reach. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are bearing down on the Ukrainian military hub of Pokrovsk , as they have been since Moscow captured the last small-ish town in the east, Avdiivka, in February. The goal, the tactics, the geography, the pace – always the same. Yet it is usually successful. This is the wider gamble Zelensky appears comfortable with. The fall of Pokrovsk may be weeks away, by current assessments of the pace of Russian advance and speed of Ukrainian collapse in both positions and morale. It may, at best, submit to another slow, horrific winterlong grind before it falls. But the fall appears likely.

Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters After Pokrovsk, there is truly nothing to defend – no major town or position – until the city of Dnipro itself, on the other side of the vast Zaporizhzhia region, about a two-hour drive away. Unless the Kursk gambit causes Russia to stretch so thin that its Donetsk operations stall, Kyiv will need to wildly fortify the rear behind Pokrovsk, or risk a pacy Russian advance across open ground that could truly alter the future shape of Ukraine. Zelensky is, it seems, happy to accept that risk and has calculated that the damage he can do to Putin’s prestige – by taking out oil infrastructure and military targets deep inside the Motherland and annexing part of his borders – is a necessary and an urgent war aim, regardless of how oblivious Putin and his public seem to be to this embarrassment. It gives Ukraine a “win,” at least, which may fix two of Kyiv’s urgent problems: the will of NATO allies to provide arms to a losing campaign, and the willingness of Ukrainian men to fight in a losing war. He has assessed that the loss of Pokrovsk may be inevitable, and a sacrifice Ukraine can make in the pursuit of wider damage to the Kremlin’s borders. CNN Related article Ukraine aims to create Kursk ‘buffer zone,’ Zelensky says, as Kyiv’s forces blow up second Russian bridge The heavy intwining with US politics was also evident when Zelensky said Tuesday he would in September present his ‘secret’ plan for victory – likely intense drone strikes, perhaps also using US-supplied longer-range weapons – to President Joe Biden, and candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. He is daring them to refuse him this chance, and trying to make being a Russia hawk part of the November election calculus. It may backfire, but more likely lead to some silent acquiescence, and Kyiv inflicting what damage it can as Moscow adapts again. Yet an unfamiliar new paradigm is emerging, one which Zelensky addressed directly too. The threat of Russian escalation is almost absent in the conversation. It is as if the limit of their conventional powers has been exposed by the humiliation of Kursk, along with the emptiness of their nuclear rhetoric. The latter cannot be entirely ignored, if the Kremlin feels an existential threat so grave it is willing to risk the overwhelming conventional NATO response it will likely face from nuclear escalation. But Putin’s powers appear very diminished. Zelensky has divined Ukraine’s moment is now, and that after November there is a 50% chance Trump will impose an unpleasant peace, or that NATO cohesion will slowly erode, or that he will struggle to fill his own trenches with willing Ukrainian soldiers. And in the weeks ahead, he is willing to leave huge swaths of territory vulnerable, as well as cross every one of Russia’s red lines – once hallowed yet now shifting daily – in the pursuit of a point at which Moscow breaks and decides to yield. He must hope the pressure is being felt as acutely by Putin."

The June 6, 1944, landings on the beaches of France are often thought of in the West as the turning point in Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s conquest of Europe, but the die was cast for Germany’s defeat from July 5 to August 23, 1943, when millions of troops and thousands of tanks and armored guns did battle around Kursk, the historians say. With victory in Kursk, “the Soviets seized the initiative in the east and never surrendered it until the end of the war,” said Michael Bell, executive director of the Jenny Craig Institute for the Study of War and Democracy at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. What was the Battle of Kursk? In the spring of 1943, Hitler’s army in the east was badly wounded by the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Germans lost almost a million men in their attempt to take the city on the Volga River, rout a battered Soviet army, and capture oil fields in the southern Caucasus that could provide the fuel for Germany’s full conquest of Europe. Soviet leader Josef Stalin ordered Stalingrad defended at all costs and German advances during the late summer and fall of 1942 were pushed back during the winter, and what was left of the German forces in the city surrendered by February 1943. As German forces were pushed back along the Eastern Front after Stalingrad, Hitler’s generals looked for a way to regain the initiative in the east and settled on trying to pinch off a Soviet salient, a 150-mile, north-to-south bulge in the German lines, defended by more than a million men and centered on Kursk. The generals wanted to attack in the spring, but Hitler pushed back the start of the operation, dubbed Operation Citadel, so some of Germany’s newest tanks could be dispatched to the battlefront. Battle of Kursk bulge, July 1943. Sovfoto/Universal Images Group/Getty Images This gave the Soviets ample time to prepare defenses for what was an obvious point for an attack, said Peter Mansoor, a professor of history at The Ohio State University and former US Army armored cavalry commander. “It was pretty easy to tell that the Germans would have an interest in squeezing this bulge out of the front,” Mansoor said. Germany would commit as many as 800,000 troops and around 3,000 tanks to take that salient. But they faced formidable defenses. Bell, from the World War II museum, said the Soviets prepared a series of defensive lines, dug 3,000 miles of anti-tank ditches and laid 400,000 land mines to defend the bulge, while putting 75% of its armor and 40% of its manpower on the Eastern Front in the Kursk salient or in reserve behind it. While the new tanks Hitler wanted in the battle were more powerful than Soviet armor, Stalin’s forces had the numerical advantage, Bell said. “The Germans have some superior equipment, but the superiority in numbers is clearly on the Soviet side,” Bell said.

Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images Related article Quit dating apps, Russia tells border region citizens over security fears Some estimates of Soviet strength in the Battle of Kursk surpass 2 million troops and more than 7,000 tanks. The numerical advantage tipped even further to the Soviet side when on July 9, Allied forces landed on the Italian island of Sicily, opening a new front Hitler had to defend and prompting him to transfer some forces from the Eastern Front to Italy, the historians said. The German forces that remained could not break the Soviet defenses, falling well short of objectives and never penetrating deep into rear areas. The cost to Hitler’s forces was steep, with casualty figures ranging up to 200,000 or more killed and around 1,000 tanks lost, according to histories of the battle. “The Germans were never able to mass forces again to the magnitude that they attempt with this battle,” Bell said. “What Kursk did was eliminate the German armor reserves and thereby made it impossible for the Germans to successfully defend the Russian front for the rest of the war,” Mansoor said. “After Kursk, the Germans could no longer replace their manpower losses and they lost the cream of their armored corps there,” he said. The Kursk battlefield today When Ukrainian forces crossed the border into the Kursk region on August 6, they had an advantage that the Germans didn’t have in 1943 – surprise. The offensive was planned in complete secrecy, and troop movements were made to look like reinforcements of defensive positions or an exercise inside Ukraine. And Russia was not prepared to defend that territory like it was in portions of Ukraine which it has taken, Mansoor said.

And that may play to Ukraine’s advantage today, said the former US Army armored cavalry officer. Ukraine has created maneuver space inside Russian territory using combined arms warfare – successfully synchronizing infantry, long-range artillery and aviation in support of each other – something Kyiv’s forces had not been able to do before. “It really changes the nature of the war, at least in that area of the front line,” Mansoor said."

At a press conference in Ukraine’s capital on Tuesday, Zelensky said he plans on attending the United Nations General Assembly in September, where he would meet Biden. He added that the plan’s success largely depends on the US. “The success of this plan depends on him. Will they give what we have in this plan or not. Will we be free to use what we have in this plan or not,” he asked. He said the plan would be presented to both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. “As we don’t know who the president of the US will be and we want to conduct this plan,” he said. While light on details, Zelensky said the four-stage plan began with the cross-border incursion into Kursk, which he said “is already done.” Rescue workers remove rubble at the site of a Russian missile strike in Kharkiv's Slobidskyi district on August 25, 2024.

The plan of our victory. It may sound ambitious for someone, but it’s a very important plan for us,” he said. He stopped short of giving more information, saying “he can’t say everything.” Ukraine’s surprise military incursion this month left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. Kyiv seems to have multiple goals with the assault, from boosting morale after a torrid few months to stretching Russia’s resources. It also raised questions on how it would end aggressions as Russia has continued to advance in eastern Ukraine and is closing in on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region, where authorities are scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of residents Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN that one of the objectives of the Kursk offensive was to divert Russian forces away from other Ukrainian cities, primarily Pokrovsk and Kurakhovo. “Of course, the enemy understands this, so it continues to focus its main efforts on the Pokrovsk direction, where its most capable units are concentrated,” Syrskyi said on Tuesday in response to a CNN question. Speaking at the heads of state institutions forum in Kyiv, Syrskyi claimed around 30,000 Russian forces have already been redeployed to Kursk, adding that the “figure is growing.” CNN cannot independently verify this number. At the same forum, Zelensky hailed Ukraine’s development of what he described as a new long-range rocket drone, called “Palianytsia,” which he has previously suggested was Ukraine’s “own way to take real action” amid restrictions by Western allies on the use of long-range weapons within Russia. “Palianytsia” is a Ukrainian word for a type of bread that is typically reputed to be difficult to pronounce by Russians. Since the start of the war, Ukrainians have used the word to identify saboteurs or members of the Russian military.

The water supply was cut immediately after that. She knew immediately the day would turn into a struggle. She works from her home in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, and no power means no work. But living at war gives her a different perspective. “We don’t mind the fact that there is no electricity or water, we are more worried about our lives,” Novorzhytska told CNN in an interview. Russia launched its biggest ever aerial attack against Ukraine on Monday, hitting energy infrastructure across the country. More strikes landed on Tuesday morning, killing five people and raising the death toll from this week’s attacks to 12. The Ukrainian government and the country’s major energy companies would not disclose the scale of the disruption from the onslaught, but it is clear it knocked out power for millions. Ukraine’s largest private energy company DTEK announced rolling blackouts for number of regions on Monday, including Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk. For people on the western outskirts of the capital, this meant six hours of darkness followed by two hours of power between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. The scheduled cuts add inconvenience to people’s lives, but they at least allow them to plan around power outages – so that residents of high-rise apartment blocks don’t get stuck outside when the elevators are not working, and that people charge up vital electronic devices while the power is on. That these blackouts are already needed in the summer is particularly worrying. This situation could be far worse in a few months’ time, when demand for electricity tends to be higher in the cold, dark winter. “The key task is to get through the winter, to provide energy supply to critical infrastructure, people and the economy,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told reporters on Tuesday. Shmyhal said the focus now was on repair and rebuilding. “We do this all the time, after each Russian shelling billions are allocated (and) equipment is brought to Ukraine.” Restaurant workers put out generators during a blackout in the Ukrainian capital on August 27. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Powering up Ukrainians have become used to living under the constant threat of blackouts. Monday’s attack stood out because of its massive scale, but it was not unusual in terms of the means Moscow used and the targets it chose. Energy infrastructure has long suffered from Russian strikes. In Kyiv, authorities have set up “points of invincibility,” tents and other areas where people can charge their electronics and use the internet during power cuts. CNN visited several invincibility points on Monday and they were all empty. Many people carry personal power banks, carrying the back-up energy supply around along with their other essentials: keys, phone, wallet, power bank. The frequent attacks on energy infrastructure have also led many Ukrainian cities to invest in solar power. Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the city has been subsidising the purchase of generators and solar panels by housing cooperatives and condominiums so that they can be independent of the energy network. The government has also put tax cuts and grants into place to help people get the equipment. The vast majority of businesses, from tiny food stalls to huge shopping malls, now have their own generators, their deep rumble synonymous with blackouts. Maksym Holubchenko, a 25-year-old barista in Kyiv said his cafe’s generator saves it from having to shut down every time there is a power cut after Russian strikes. It happens about once a month at the moment, he said. Kyiv was hot on Monday and the thermometer on the wall in Holubchenko’s cafe showed 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit). The generator is not powerful enough to cover the needs of a normal service in the the cafe, so Holubchenko has to make compromises. “In the winter we have enough power from the generator. In the summer we have to switch off the air conditioner and… parts of the coffee machine,” he said. The cafe has sockets ready for customers who need to charge up their phones and other gadgets, as well as use the internet during power cuts.

With minimum casualties. This has to be over,” she told CNN. Russia has been targeting Ukraine’s energy grid since its full-scale invasion in February 2022 but this year Moscow began specifically targeting power generation facilities: thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations and even energy storage facilities. Olha Matskiv, a legal expert at Global Rights Compliance, an international NGO that is advising Ukraine on investigating and prosecuting war crimes, said the attacks are “creating conditions inside Ukraine that are incompatible with life.” “This is a tactic that the Russian army is using to drain Ukraine’s internal reserves, both human and financial, slowing down the country’s economy, which cannot develop when businesses are closing due to lack of electricity,” she added. The government has been trying to fortify Ukraine’s energy network so that it can withstand strikes, first wrapping them to protect them from shrapnel and then using reinforced concrete defenses that can withstand some direct hits. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Smyhal said the measures are working. “Dozens of missiles attacked substations on Monday and we lost a very small amount of our equipment out of dozens of hits yesterday thanks to the protection,” he told reporters. He added that Ukraine is experimenting with huge protective structures the size of three football fields to cover bigger power stations. “They are extremely expensive, and their economic feasibility is still not clear. The cost of such protection for six substations is 188 billion hryvnia ($4.5 billion). This is an incredible amount of money that partners are not ready to give and that is not in the state budget,” Smyhal said.

Moscow has since followed that with a second wave of strikes early Tuesday morning. Monday’s onslaught, which killed at least seven people and caused power outages in several cities, marked Russia’s “most massive air attack” in more than two-and-a-half years of conflict, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. The nationwide strikes used “more than 100 missiles of various types and around 100 Shahed drones,” Zelensky said. Ukraine shot down 102 of the missiles and 99 attack drones, Oleshchuk said. At least 15 regions were targeted by a combination of drones, cruise missiles and hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, officials said, from the frontline eastern regions of Kharkiv and Dnipro to the southern port city of Odesa, as well as the capital, Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky vowed to retaliate against Russia for the attack during a daily address as he implored allies to lift restrictions on using Western weapons for long-range strikes inside Russian territory. Long-range strikes are instrumental in “destroying” Russian forces “exactly in the areas” from where they launch strikes on Ukraine, Zelensky said. “This is the optimal counter-terrorism tactic,” he added. Russia’s Tuesday strikes killed at least five people and injured more than 10 across Ukraine, according to officials. Of those, two died after a missile attack on a hotel in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, and three were killed in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zelensky said those strikes used more than 90 aerial weapons, including 81 Shahed drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles.

Reuters Ukraine had been bracing for a major Russian attack for weeks, in response to Kyiv’s shock incursion into the border region of Kursk – the first foreign invasion of Russia since World War II. Ahead of Ukraine’s Independence Day on Saturday, the US Embassy in Kyiv had warned of an increased risk of Russian drone and missile attacks. Monday’s overnight assault came hours after Ukraine’s foreign ministry called on Belarus to withdraw what it described as a “significant” buildup of Belarusian forces and equipment at their shared border. Kyiv also reported that former Wagner mercenaries were among the troops at the border and urged Minsk “not to make tragic mistakes for their country under Moscow’s pressure.” Throughout the conflict, Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure , attempting to plunge its citizens into darkness and use freezing winter temperatures as a weapon of war. After Monday’s attack, Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said “the energy sector is in the crosshairs” and the extent of the damage was being investigated. “Russian terrorists have once again targeted energy infrastructure,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Telegram Monday. Ukraine’s national energy company, Ukrenergo, has been forced to implement emergency power cuts to stabilize the system, Shmyhal said. Power outages have been recorded in several cities, including Kyiv and Dnipro, according to Serhii Kovalenko, chief executive of the Yasno energy company.

Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty Images Later Monday, Russia’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had launched “a massive strike with long-range precision air and sea-based weapons” against Ukraine’s power grid and rail lines, which it said disrupted the transport of weapons and ammunition to the frontlines. “All designated targets were hit,” the ministry said. Deaths from Monday’s strikes were reported in the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Volyn, Zhytomyr and Kharkiv regions, according to Ukrainian authorities. At least 47 people were injured in the attacks, including four children, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said. CNN teams in Kyiv and Dnipro heard several explosions overnight into Monday. In Kyiv, the head of the city military administration said air defenses were working in the region and the outskirts of the capital and advised people to stay in shelters. In Kharkiv, emergency services were working at an undisclosed number of sites targeted in the attacks, according to its regional military head.

Fearing Russian escalation, Western countries have prohibited Ukraine from using the weapons it has been given to strike missile and drone launch sites deep inside Russia, meaning Kyiv has to rely mostly on its air defenses to stem Moscow’s attacks. Following Monday’s strikes, Ukrainian officials once again asked their allies to allow them to strike deeper into Russia. “Every leader, every one of our partners, knows the decisive actions required to end this war justly. Ukraine cannot be constrained in its long-range capabilities when the terrorists face no such limitations,” Zelensky said. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry, Dmytro Kuleba, also made two requests of Kyiv’s allies: “First, affirming Ukraine’s long-range strikes on all legitimate military targets on Russian territory. Second, agreeing to use partners’ air defense capabilities to shoot down missiles and drones close to their airspace.” West of Ukraine, Poland’s military said it is searching for what is believed to be a drone that likely entered its territory during Russia’s overnight assault, according to Polish state media. The Polish armed forces were ready for a possible shooting down of this object, which was not a rocket, that crossed the border on Monday morning but weather conditions did not allow for visual identification, a spokesperson for the Polish army’s operational command Jacek Goryszewski said Monday. He added that no explosions were recorded. The widespread aerial assault comes two days after a Russian strike on a hotel in the Donetsk region killed a British safety adviser and wounded two journalists over the weekend. Ryan Evans, a former soldier, had been working with Reuters since 2022 and advised its journalists on safety around the world including in Ukraine, Israel and at the Paris Olympics, the news agency said.

Maksym Holubchenko a 25-year old barista in Kyiv, was still at home when Russia launched Monday’s early-morning barrage, but he said he went to work anyway. “This is the reality for us, it’s been nearly three years. Everyone is used to it. Just a normal day, well… it’s not normal – this shouldn’t be happening in the 21st century,” he told CNN. While the generator keeps the cafe running, it adds extra cost and work. Holubchenko said at the moment, power cuts like the one on Monday happen roughly once a month. “You need to change oil, the barista has to start it, service it, when we come to work we just want to make coffee and work with people but have to get busy with other things,” he said. With the generator needing some 3.5 liters of fuel every hour, fuel canisters are lined up at the back of the cafe, ready to top it up.

David is almost 3 years old, born just a few months before the start of the full-scale invasion. He knows nothing but the war. “He only started to react to the explosions two months ago. I tell him it’s fireworks, I don’t want to tell him what is happening. But I’ve written ‘There is a war’ in his baby album,” she said, tears flooding her eyes. Arina quickly wiped them away, not wanting David to see her cry. People have to keep living, she said. Like for many others in the area, the war didn’t start two and half years ago for Arina. She was in medical school in Donetsk in 2014, when Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and Russian-sponsored separatists took over large swathes of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Some 2 million people, including Arina, were forced to flee their homes. “You get used (to running away). And it’s horrible that you can get used to such a thing. You have to adapt to a new reality all the time. First you fall into depression and panic. Try to start a life in a new place. You live and live and then you wake up at five in the morning from (missiles and rockets) flying over your head,” she said. Donetsk region’s police officer Pavlo Dyachenko, has spent the past few weeks coordinating evacuations from Pokrovsk and other towns in the area.

Compared with images from other cities under attack, Pokrovsk is still relatively calm. People here have a routine. They are out and about in the mornings, getting supplies and running errands. By mid-afternoon, the streets are deserted. Everybody here knows that drones are most likely to strike later in the day. Most big supermarkets and shops have now closed, but smaller businesses remain open – including a small restaurant popular with the locals that is owned by Yulia, 34. She and her family – a husband and a daughter – are all packed up and ready to leave. They’ve shut their other restaurant in Pokrovsk but kept the one in the city center open. “We keep working. We work, we have clients, our employees who live here, so we will stay for some time, of course we will not stay to the very end. We won’t wait till the horrible shelling. But for now it’s possible,” she told CNN. This is not what Dyachenko wants to hear though. “We explain to people that the situation can change very quickly. I try to tell them personal stories of people we had to evacuate after they got trapped in Bakhmut or Avdiivka,” Dyachenko told CNN. “In Selydove, it felt absolutely fine one day and then the glide bombs started coming,” he said. People from Pokrovsk and surrounding areas board an evacuation train amid continuing Russian advances towards the city. Ivana Kottasová/CNN Dyachenko told CNN his men won’t drag anyone out by force. But the operation gets riskier each day. Leaving Pokrovsk is easy, people can just drive or take an evacuation train. But just a few miles down the road, those who hesitated to leave are now being extracted by the police in armored vehicles, sometimes under fire. “It gets more and more dangerous,” Dyachenko added. Dobryak, the head of Pokrovsk military-civilian administration, said that previous experience from the region suggests about 10% of people tend to stay no matter what, so the city will continue providing critical services for as long as it can. But given the fast advances of Russian forces toward the city in recent days, it seems more than likely that the fighting will get worse and could reach the heart of the city soon. An officer from one of the Ukrainian brigades fighting in the area said they have been outnumbered and outgunned by Russian troops, some of whom are from the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic and know the area well. But there are other problems too. The officer said that communication between the different brigades hasn’t been ideal and most of the defenses built in the area were not effective. Dobryak said the city and regional administrations have been told by the military where and how to build defenses and fortifications – a process that started when Moscow launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He said he is hoping Pokrovsk’s defenses can withstand the attack – but he knows it’s a tall order. “Whatever fortification we have, they have 10 times more men and vehicles. Same with artillery rounds. We lost the momentum in the winter when we were not receiving the (US) aid package. But our heroic men fight with what they have,” he said. Oksana (center, in black) and Oleh (second from the right) decided to take their family out of Pokrovsk once the explosions became too frequent. Ivana Kottasová/CNN Refugees not welcome? Among the hundreds of anxious people crowding the city’s train station on Saturday afternoon, a few looked like they wanted to leave. Many were visibly exhausted and heartbroken, Pokrovsk being the only home they’ve ever known. As the evacuation train prepared to pull out, many were crying, waving their last goodbyes to loved ones staying behind. “Every day, every night, explosions. It was building up slowly, but getting louder and louder every day,” Oksana, 37, told CNN while waiting on the platform. She looked nervous, keeping one eye on her two daughters and the other on her mother Liubov. Oksana’s husband Oleh, 34, was going to travel with them on the train, making sure they were safe. But he would then go straight back home. A miner, he needs to keep working – money is tight, and he can’t afford to leave his job. “I’ll go if the mine shuts down and they tell us to go,” he said. The family were hesitant to leave Pokrovsk because Liubov, 70, recently suffered a stroke and is now unable to speak or walk. When three police officers in body armor and helmets carried her up into the train, she looked completely stoic, her face showing no sign of emotion. Liubov, 70, is being lifted onto the evacuation train by Pokrovsk police. Ivana Kottasová/CNN “It just became too dangerous here. The authorities and the girls’ school were convincing us to go, most of our friends are also going,” Oksana said, adding that at the end, she wanted her children – Hanna, 14, and Dasha, 9 – to be settled in a new place by the time they go back to school in a week’s time. Like most children in the region, the two have been attending online classes during the war. In-person education is too dangerous around here. Earlier this month, a school in Pokrovsk that had been turned into a shelter was hit by two Russian rockets. It now stands in ruins. Dasha is about to start fourth grade and between the war and the Covid pandemic before that, she has never experienced normal schooling. Yet her desires are just the same as those of any youngster anywhere. “When we have our own house, we will get a dog and a cat,” she said, pointing to the promise her parents have made for after the war. The dog will be a poodle, Dasha said. “The name will depend on the color,” she added. But even as the front line rolls closer and closer, some are still not convinced they will leave. Many don’t have anywhere to go; some feel unwelcome in the rest of Ukraine. At a butcher shop near the Pokrovsk train station, Oksana, the shopkeeper, says she doesn’t think she’d be able to leave. “I have two dogs and I am feeding all of the dogs around here, I have my work, my mother who is over 80 years old and can barely walk, I can’t leave,” she told CNN. “Of course the authorities are asking us to leave, but where can we go? We don’t have any friends or family that we could stay with, and nobody wants to let an apartment to people with animals,” she said.

Donbas, the area that spans the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, has always been culturally different compared to the rest of the country, its economy powered by mining and heavy industry. Flourishing before the events of 2014, the region took a hit when the war started. Many Ukrainians blamed the people in the Donbas region for the war – especially since some local residents did initially welcome the pro-Russian separatists with joy. “We were only united when it was Kyiv. Kyiv is crying – the whole country is crying. When Donbas is being pounded and we are being pounded for a long time, there is no word about united Ukraine,” she said. Like most people in Donbas, Oksana is a Russian speaker – another thing that sets her apart from western Ukrainians. “They say it’s Putin’s language. I am Ukrainian and I speak Russian, it’s my language and I speak it, even though I understand Ukrainian too,” Oksana said, adding that she cannot imagine leaving Pokrovsk, her home for 25 years. Sitting on a bench surrounded by bags and suitcases, Halyna and Olexey said they didn’t have a choice. Not leaving was not an option. “There is no power, no water, the gas was disconnected a long time ago. There were explosions everywhere, everything was destroyed,” Olexey said, waiting for a car to pick him and Halyna up. Halyna and Olexey wait for volunteers to pick them up and drive them to Dnipro. Ivana Kottasová/CNN They are determined to return. They are going to Italy to join their daughter, who has been living there since 2022. They haven’t seen their granddaughter in over two years and are afraid she won’t understand them, as she now goes to an Italian school. Halyna said she was looking forward to seeing her daughter and granddaughter again, of course, but is categorically opposed to living in Italy forever. “I don’t want to live in Italy. I want to live in the country that I was born in. I want to live here, in my home, in Ukraine,” Halyna said. “I don’t know Italian, I don’t know English, when we get there, I won’t be able to go anywhere without my daughter. I don’t want that,” Olexey added. The next morning, just 24 hours after fleeing their home, Olexey and Halyna found themselves lost in Dnipro. Used to their lives in a small town, the couple was trying to navigate the big city, looking for a cash machine. They were struggling to come to terms with their new reality.  They are refugees now."

Reuters had a six-person crew staying at the Hotel Sapphire as part of its team covering the war in Ukraine . A spokesperson for the news agency identified the killed safety adviser as Ryan Evans, a 38-year-old British citizen who was assigned to its reporting team in Ukraine. Reuters added that two of its journalists were being treated in hospital, one for serious injuries. In a statement on Sunday afternoon, it said “we are urgently seeking more information about the attack, including by working with the authorities in Kramatorsk, and we are supporting our colleagues and their families. We send our deepest condolences and thoughts to Ryan’s family and loved ones. Ryan has helped so many of our journalists cover events around the world; we will miss him terribly.” Members of emergency services stand at the site where the hotel was hit. Vitalii Hnidyi/Reuters Evans, a former British soldier, had been working with Reuters since 2022 and advised its journalists on safety around the world including in Ukraine, Israel and at the Paris Olympics, the news agency said. Three other colleagues have been accounted for and suffered mild injuries, Reuters added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in his daily address on Sunday that British and American citizens were in the Kramatorsk hotel, adding “My condolences go out to the family and friends. This is a daily Russian terror that continues, because Russia has the ability to continue.” A spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said, “We are aware of reports of a British national missing in Ukraine and are seeking more information from the local authorities.” The US State Department has confirmed that an American citizen was among those injured but has not identified the person. Rescuers uncovered the body of one man under the rubble, the head of Kramatorsk City’s military administration, Oleksandr Honcharenko, said in an update on Sunday afternoon. He did not give further details or identify the body. The head of Donetsk regional military administration, Vadym Filashkin, said the injured journalists include “citizens of Ukraine, the United States, Latvia and Germany.” He confirmed on Telegram Sunday morning that the deceased was a British citizen. The Reuters crew managed to file video on Sunday morning of the extensive damage done to the hotel, showing emergency services searching through huge piles of rubble with torches.

It remains one of the largest cities under Ukrainian control in the country’s besieged east. In April 2022, Russian forces carried out a missile strike on Kramatorsk’s railway station that was being used to shelter civilians fleeing the fighting.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill banning religious groups with ties to Russia Saturday, Ukraine’s Independence Day. The bill’s main target is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) which has historically been linked to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate. Zelensky referenced the bill in his nightly address, saying “Ukrainian orthodoxy today is taking a step toward liberation from the devils of Moscow.” The new law gives the UOC and other religious groups nine months to cut ties with Russia or risk being shut down by court order. The law passed Ukraine’s parliament on August 20, with 265 lawmakers voting for and 29 voting against. While the UOC claims to have cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church in 2022, Ukraine’s State Service for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience says the links are still intact and the church remains in Moscow’s orbit. Ukraine’s Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has accused the UOC of spreading pro-Moscow propaganda. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the SBU has opened criminal proceedings against more than 100 clergymen of the UOC. Nearly 50 have already been charged and 26 have received sentences, according to the SBU. A Ukrainian soldier walks past at a city hall in Sudzha, Kursk region, Russia, Friday, Aug. 16, 2024.

(AP Photo) AP/File Related article Kyiv’s incursion into Russia sends a defiant message to its Western backers: We can win this war One of the clerics convicted used his sermons to defend the full-scale invasion of Russia and the seizure of parts of Ukraine. In conversations with parishioners, the cleric tried to persuade them to go to Russia or occupied regions to help Russians. He was sentenced to five years. The purpose of this law is to ban the activities of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine “which is an instrument of Russian influence and propaganda” according to Mykyta Poturaiev, a Ukrainian member of Parliament who sponsored the bill. “The Moscow Patriarchate is not an inspiration but a participant in the war,” Poturaiev said. The majority of Ukrainians are Orthodox. For centuries, Ukrainian churches were subordinate to and administered by the Moscow Patriarchate. But with Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine’s Orthodox churches split. In 2019, the spiritual leader of the Orthodox world Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople officially recognized an independent Kyiv-based Orthodox Church of Ukraine. For the leader of Ukraine’s Kyiv-based church Metropolitan Epiphanius, the law provides an opportunity “to protect the Ukrainian spiritual space from the yoke of the Russian world.” “Everyone can see that in Russia, religious centers, not only the Moscow Patriarchate, but also the centers of Muslims, Protestants, and Buddhists, are under the full control of the Kremlin. They spread the ideology of the Russian world, justify the war against Ukraine, and say that it is a so-called holy war. That the destruction of Ukraine is a morally justified goal and even a duty of Russian troops,” he said. According to a survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in April 2024, 83% of Ukrainians believed that the state should intervene in the activities of the UOC to one degree or another. In particular, 63% believe that Ukrainian Orthodox Church should be completely banned in Ukraine. Metropolitan Clement, spokesperson of the UOC criticized the bill in a statement on Facebook, calling the law as an attempt “to divide people into right and wrong citizens.” Outside a UOC church in Kyiv, a 47-year-old parishioner said recent moves against his church were stifling. “The government is now creeping into my soul. It is up to me to decide how I pray. They have gone completely crazy,” the parishioner – who refused to give his name for fear of reprisal – told CNN. Ihor, a Ukrainian officer, used to worship in the UOC but said he has stopped going to church altogether. While he doesn’t think politics should get involved with religion, he acknowledges “there are many priests in Ukrainian Orthodox Church who support Russia and war in Ukraine. For this they must answer for before God.” Kosta Gak contributed reporting."

Just as importantly, it’s also sent a political message to Kyiv’s allies that has changed the prevailing narrative of the war - that Ukrainian forces are doomed to fight an endless rearguard action against superior Russian firepower. Suddenly, Moscow’s oft-repeated insistence that all the goals of what President Vladimir Putin still calls the “special military operation” will be achieved ring hollow. Ukrainian forces claim to have taken almost as much territory in Russia this month (some 1,200 square kilometers by their own estimates) as the Russians have won inside Ukraine all year. Moscow has seen setbacks ever since it launched its 2022 invasion, which was designed to capture Kyiv in less than a week. But the goals – and the methods to pursue them – have not changed. Massive bombardment accompanied by costly use of infantry have gradually eaten into Ukrainian territory. The situation in the Kursk region.

Russia, Kursk region, Kursk Anatoliy Zhdanov/Kommersant/Sipa USA via AP Related article How Ukraine turned the war on its head with surprise attack on southern Russia Analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said “Putin likely assesses that as long as Russia can retain the initiative and prevent Ukraine from conducting operationally significant counteroffensive operations, Russia can inflict decisive losses on Ukraine over the long term, while outlasting Western security assistance to Ukraine and Ukrainian efforts to mobilize more of Ukraine’s economy and population for the war effort.” Mathieu Boulegue, Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, agreed that “if you look at the grand strategy for each country, perhaps not much has changed.” “But for the first time in many months this operation has forced a different narrative on the Kremlin, the first cracks in Putin’s narrative,” Boulegue told CNN. Turning the tide of the war The Ukrainian military has confounded a growing consensus among Ukraine’s supporters that it had little chance of recovering much – if any – of its own territory. In Kyiv’s view, Kursk demonstrates its military deserves continuing, faster and better support from allies because it can change the direction of the war. President Volodymyr Zelensky made this point in an address last week: “We’ve already expanded and will continue to expand the circle of those who support a just end to this war. It’s essential that Ukraine enters this fall even stronger than before.” Mick Ryan, a former general in Australia and author of the Futura Doctrina blog, said Kursk “has demonstrated Ukrainian learning and adaptation after the failure of its 2023 counteroffensive,” referring to the much-hyped assault that delivered few gains for Kyiv. “The Ukrainian aim here is to demonstrate that Russian victory is not inevitable, and that Ukraine can fight and win,” added Ryan – persuading the doubters to sustain support and perhaps more importantly further relax restrictions on how and where their weapons can be used. The Ukrainians have persistently sought to overcome hesitation among allies about supplying systems that might escalate the conflict - first with artillery and battle-tanks, later with F16 combat jets and longer-range missiles such as HIMARS and ATACMs. Until May, the use of US weapons to strike Russian soil was a red line for a Biden administration apprehensive of escalation. Then came Russia’s incursion into Kharkiv region, aided by long-range strikes from well within Russian territory. The Ukrainians were in effect fighting with one hand behind their back; the city of Kharkiv was vulnerable. A Ukrainian soldier walks past at a city hall in Sudzha, Kursk region, Russia, Friday, Aug. 16, 2024. This image was approved by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry before publication. AP/File The ban was relaxed, allowing some US systems to target Russian territory. In Kursk the Ukrainians have further eroded it by using armor inside Russia. US, German and UK-provided armored vehicles and tanks have been seen barreling through the Russian countryside; western missiles have brought down bridges that might otherwise abet Russian defenders. Zelensky has said that Russia’s bluff has been called. “The whole naive, illusory concept of the so-called red lines in relation to Russia, which prevailed in the assessments of the war of some of our partners, crumbled in these days somewhere near Sudzha,” he said. “Ukraine has demonstrated, again, that the various red lines projected by the Russian president are nothing but a chimera designed to reinforce Western political timidity about decision-making on the war,” Ryan said. Boulegue argued the Kursk operation is a valuable way for both Ukraine’s allies “to test Putin’s pain threshold, a really good way to test Russia’s other forms of deterrence using a proxy.” “Russian red lines are fluid, and this is another incidence of raising the temperature gradually.” TOPSHOT - A woman uses her smartphone walking past a mural depicting members of Russia's Young Army patriotic movement in Moscow on May 14, 2024. Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images Related article Quit dating apps, Russia tells border region citizens over security fears The Ukrainians have won an important political argument here: there have been no public objections from Western capitals to the opening of this new front, and indeed plaudits from many members of NATO, including Germany, the UK and the United States. “As they see attacks coming across the border, they have to be able to have the capabilities to respond,” Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters earlier this month. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, went further, saying on X Wednesday that “Lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities vs the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would have several important effects: -Strengthen Ukrainian self-defense by ending Russia’s sanctuary for its attacks and bombardments of Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine. Help advance peace efforts.” But there is a limit to the West’s level of comfort. Ukraine would like to target airfields deep inside Russia with longer-range ATACM missiles; Washington does not seem inclined to agree. Zelensky has countered that “If our partners lifted all existing restrictions on using such weapons on Russian territory, then we wouldn’t need physically to enter the Kursk region with the aim of protecting our Ukrainian citizens in border regions and destroying the Russian aggression potential.” But taking Russian land improves Ukraine’s bargaining position at any negotiations, and also works as a hedge should former President Donald Trump win the US election and seek to force a peace settlement on Ukraine. Western way of fighting The success of the Kursk incursion was not just down to Western hardware: Ukrainian intelligence gathering, planning and special forces executed the operation, along with plenty of Ukrainian-made drones, artillery, electronic warfare and even thermobaric weapons. That “highlights Ukraine’s agency, thereby undermining Russia’s portrayal of the conflict as a proxy war with the West,” noted Olga Tatariuk at Chatham House. It also offers allies reassurance that the Ukrainians are not doomed always to be on the defensive; that they are learning the Western way of fighting after the high hopes for 2023’s counter-offensive were shattered.

We were moving in the center, we had support left and right from us. Great operation.” The Kursk operation remains a high-stakes gamble for Ukraine at a time when Russian forces are closing in on two important hubs in eastern Donetsk: the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. But Ukrainian forces have shown that the conflict is not a one-way street. “We don’t know yet whether this will be a footnote or a game changer,” said the analyst Boulegue. For the Ukrainians, sustaining the operation as Russia brings more artillery and aviation to bear will become increasingly difficult. But for every passing day that Ukrainian forces control an area of Russian territory the size of Hong Kong, the Kursk incursion becomes less of a footnote."

The sanctions from the US Treasury and State Departments hit nearly 400 people and entities both in and outside Russia, including China. The sanctions – unveiled ahead of Ukrainian Independence Day – specifically target those supporting the Russian supply chain and defense base, as well as those helping Moscow to evade current sanctions. In a further show of support for Ukraine, Biden on Friday announced a new aid package that includes air defense missiles and counter-drone equipment. “When Russia’s senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country,” Biden wrote in a lengthy statement. “Today, it is still a free country. And the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free, sovereign, and independent country.” Biden, who spoke Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that for two and a half years, the Ukrainian people had “repelled Russia’s vicious onslaught, including retaking more than half of the territory Russian forces seized in the initial days of the war” and had “remained unbowed in the face of Russia’s heinous war crimes and atrocities.” “And day after day, they have defended the values that unite people across both of our nations and around the world—including independence,” Biden wrote. “That is why I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid for Ukraine today.” In addition to air defense equipment, the package includes anti-armor missiles and ammunition. “Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict,” he wrote. “The independent people of Ukraine will prevail—and the United States, our Allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of the way.” “We continue to support Ukraine’s fight for their independence, and independence that that they have had to defend pretty mightily here over the last two and a half years,” National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told reporters Friday morning. “And so, I suspect that as we officially mark their Independence Day … you’ll see that we will back up that philosophical support for their independence with more tangible support as well, including in particular more security assistance coming to Ukraine to help them as they defend themselves.” ‘Enduring commitment’ Friday’s slew of sanctions – which Biden called “part of our enduring commitment to hold Russia accountable for its aggression” – specifically crack down on a number of Chinese-based companies. The US and its European partners have expressed strong concern about Beijing’s support for Russia’s war economy and its export of dual-use items for use in the war in Ukraine. July’s NATO Summit declaration called Beijing “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine” and warned that China “cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.” US officials said they had warned their Chinese counterparts about the risk of supporting Moscow’s war effort. A State Department fact sheet said it remains “concerned by the magnitude of dual-use goods exports from the PRC to Russia,” using the acronym for China’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China. “Russia continues to leverage sanctions evasion and circumvention networks” to get microelectronics and machine tools “which it uses to make weapons,” it said. “Imports from the PRC are filling critical gaps in Russia’s defense production cycle, thereby enabling it to produce weapons, ramp up defense production, and bolster its military-industrial base.” “Today, the Department is also designating several PRC-based entities that have supplied goods supporting Russia’s war effort, including ones responsible for developing, producing, and supplying manufacturing equipment to entities based in Russia,” the fact sheet said. Treasury said it is targeting “numerous transnational networks, including those involved in procuring ammunition and military materiel for Russia, facilitating sanctions evasion for Russian oligarchs through offshore trust and corporate formation services, evading sanctions imposed on Russia’s cyber actors, laundering gold for a sanctioned Russian gold company, and supporting Russia’s military-industrial base by procuring sensitive and critical items such as advanced machine tools and electronic components.” It is “also targeting Russian financial technology companies that provide necessary software and IT solutions for Russia’s financial sector,” the press release said. At the same time, the State Department “is targeting entities and individuals involved in Russia’s future energy, metals, and mining production and exports; sanctions evasion; Russia’s military-industrial base, including armed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) production, Belarusian support for Russia’s war effort, and air logistics entities; additional subsidiaries of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom; and malign actors involved in the attempted, forcible ‘re-education’ of Ukraine’s children,” the Treasury Department press release said. The new round of sanctions come as Ukraine has launched an audacious incursion into Russia’s Kursk region that has left Moscow on the back foot for the first time in months. On Tuesday, Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said troops had advanced up to 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 93 settlements.

Modi’s visit, the first by an Indian leader since Ukrainian independence, comes just weeks after he traveled to Moscow in a symbolic first overseas trip of his new term as leader, where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin that were criticized by Kyiv. After talks concluded, India’s Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar, stressed that India is committed to helping end the war. “We are very, very keen that this conflict should come to an end,” Jaishankar said at a press briefing. Despite repeatedly called for a ceasefire and peace in Ukraine, New Delhi has refrained from condemning Russia’s invasion as it seeks to maintain relations with Moscow – a major supplier of its arms and a longstanding partner it sees as key to balancing its strained relationship with China. India has also acted as an economic lifeline for Russia, ramping up purchases of its crude oil after countries around the world slapped sanctions on Moscow, isolating it economically. India overtook China as the world’s biggest importer of Russian oil last month, according to Reuters, citing data from trade and industry sources. Jaishankar defended India’s purchasing of oil from Russia, saying it was not indicative of a wider political posture. “India is a big oil consumer, it is a big oil importer, because we do not have oil. It is not like there is a political strategy to buy oil, there is an oil strategy to buy oil, there is a market strategy to buy oil,” Jaishankar said. Ukraine, throughout the war, has sought to convince countries that maintain close relationships with Russia — such as India and China — to push Putin toward Kyiv’s terms for peace. Zelensky hailed Modi’s visit as “historic” and “symbolic,” thanking India for its “support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity” over two-and-a-half years of war. The Indian leader’s arrival in Kyiv — a day ahead of Ukraine’s independence day — follows his two-day trip to Poland , where he elevated India’s ties with the NATO member. Referencing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East during a press conference in Warsaw, Modi reiterated India’s stance that “no problem can be solved on the battlefield.” “We support dialogue and diplomacy for the early restoration of peace and stability. For this, India, along with its friendly countries, is ready to provide all possible support,” Modi said Thursday alongside Polish counterpart Donald Tusk. Tusk praised Modi’s “intention to help end the war in Ukraine in a quick, peaceful and fair manner.” Zelensky welcomes Modi outside the presidential palace in Kyiv. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service via Reuters ‘Landmark visit’ Modi’s visit to Ukraine also comes at a key inflection point in the two-and-a-half-year war, as Ukrainian forces earlier this month launched an unprecedented offensive into Russian territory that Moscow is scrambling to counter. Zelensky and Kyiv officials are urgently working to expand global backing for their peace formula, which is predicated on the withdrawal of Russian troops from their land. The upcoming US presidential election has raised concerns that crucial American backing could be cut if Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has been critical of NATO and US support for Kyiv, is elected. Ukraine, throughout the war, has sought to convince countries that maintain close relationships with Russia — such as India and China — to push Putin toward Kyiv’s terms for peace. But while India attended a Kyiv-backed international peace summit in Switzerland in June, it stopped short of endorsing the gathering’s communique, saying that resolution requires a “sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict.” During his visit to Ukraine, Modi is expected to discuss with Zelensky what India’s Foreign Ministry described as “the entire gamut of bilateral relations,” including trade, infrastructure and defense.

The Ukrainian presidential office said Modi and Zelensky would “discuss issues of bilateral and multilateral cooperation” and that documents would be signed. Later, Jaishankar confirmed that the leaders signed four agreements, covering community development projects, drug control standards, cultural exchange and agriculture. Officials from both countries have in recent months expressed interest in restoring trade, which has dropped during the war, according to annual data from Ukraine.

Then, the Ukrainian leader described Modi’s rapport with Putin as a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.” Modi did not directly address the strikes at the time, but he made what appeared to be some of his most critical comments to date on the war, saying “any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die.” He also called for a “path to peace through dialogue.” CNN’s Aishwarya S Iyer, Esha Mitra, and Alex Stambaugh contributed to this report."

But his track record of handling recent crises in Russia reveals a different side of his presidential persona: one of paralysis and indecision.,"Aug 23, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Clare Sebastian,Ukraine,"CNN — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin likes to project himself as a strongman. But his track record of handling recent crises in Russia reveals a different side of his presidential persona: one of paralysis and indecision. A day and a half after Ukrainian troops stormed a Russian border crossing and continued, almost unimpeded, across the wide green fields of the southern Kursk region, Putin finally made his first public remarks on the matter. He called the incursion a “massive provocation”, accused Ukraine of indiscriminately firing on civilians, and then moved on quickly to other government business, including how to mark Russia’s “Construction Worker’s Day.” It would take another five days, and the loss of nearly 30 settlements, before he promised a military response.  There was no visit to the region to meet the tens of thousands of evacuees, no declaration of martial law. In March, after the terror attack at the Crocus City concert hall in Moscow, Russia’s deadliest in decades, it took Putin more than 24 hours to address the nation. Despite a claim of responsibility from ISIS-K, he continued to insist that Ukraine, and the West had played a role. The US had in fact warned Russia an attack could be imminent. Putin never visited the site of the attack, or survivors in hospital. When Evgeny Prigozhin, then the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, launched his aborted mutiny last June, the Russian leader’s response was marked by inconsistency. After initially slamming the incident as “treachery,” Putin left it two days before speaking publicly again, at which point he thanked the Wagner troops involved for standing down, and offered them military contracts. Then he invited Prigozhin to tea at the Kremlin. Two months later Prigozhin was killed in a mysterious plane crash in Russia. A destroyed Russian tank sits outside the Ukrainian-controlled Russian town of Sudzha, Kursk region, on August 16, 2024, 10 days after Kyiv launched a major cross-border counteroffensive. Yan Dobronosov/AFP/Getty Images More distant parallels are also easy to find, and Putin chose this week to highlight one himself.  For the first time in 16 years he visited School No.1 in Beslan, more than a week before the 20 th anniversary of the terror attack on the school that killed more than 300 people, many of them children.  In 2017 the European Court of Human Rights found that not only had the Russian authorities failed to act on prior knowledge of an imminent attack, but that the security operation was “disorganized and suffered from a lack of leadership.” “He is not good at resolving crises,” Boris Bondarev, a former Russian diplomat who resigned two years ago in protest over the war in Ukraine, and is still living outside Russia, told CNN. “It’s risky, it’s not predictable. Putin likes comfort, he likes it when he is making the crisis for others, when he controls the situation.” Shock offensive left Kremlin reeling Experts say Russia’s military response in Kursk has somewhat mirrored the fumbling reactions of its president. “The initial response when they got over the shock of what was happening would have been who have we got in the cupboard left to defend,” retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan, the author of a new book “The War for Ukraine: Strategy and Adaptation Under Fire,” told CNN. “Whether it’s conscripts, whether it’s understrength battalions from the Ukrainian theater, or strategic reserves.” Battlefield accounts have backed up the sense that a motley selection of Russian troops were rushed in, as Moscow grappled with the dilemma of how to balance defending its own soil with keeping up the slow momentum on the eastern front. Ukrainian officials said some troops were redeployed from Kharkiv region and the southern front. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed early on that his special forces unit, the Akhmat brigade, had been deployed. Naval infantry officers from the Black Sea fleet in Crimea are also involved. The diverse groupings complicated Russian efforts to coordinate its resistance, with one pro-Russian military blogger even noting on August 14 that Ukraine was deliberately creating disruptions and then retreating, “taking advantage of the fact that our diverse forces, who don’t always have good communications with each other, were activated to repel this invasion.” Russia’s bureaucratic response to the incursion has been equally unwieldy.  Defense Minister Andrei Belousov set up a coordinating council to handle security in the border regions and this week announced he was dividing up responsibilities between no fewer than five different officials. This, according to the Institute for the Study of War, “will likely create additional confusion within the Russian MoD and friction among the Russian MoD, FSB, and Rosgvardia [Russia’s national guard], all of which are attempting to operate in Kursk Oblast,” and could jeopardize Russia’s ability to mount an effective counterattack. Still, more than two weeks in, there are now signs of a more coordinated resistance. Dmytro Kholod, commander of Ukraine’s “Nightingale” battalion, currently in Kursk, told CNN by phone on Wednesday that he has noticed a shift in the behavior of Russian troops. “Now, the forces they have brought to this area are trying to storm us somehow,” he told CNN. “They no longer surrender by the hundreds. They are trying to shoot and fight back, but they still surrender when we attack them.” Ryan, the Australian retired general, agrees Russia is moving beyond the initial knee-jerk response phase, and it should start to look more organized in the days and weeks ahead. But, he believes the past two weeks have also laid bare Putin’s priorities and his own people are not currently top of the list. “The decision will be Putin’s: What is the most dangerous to him?  Ukrainians in Kursk or not succeeding in the Donbas.  I think at the moment he’s decided that it’s more dangerous to not make this progress in the Donbas than to throw everything at Kursk.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that allies' red lines in the war against Russia have ""crumbled these days somewhere near Sudzha,"" referring to a Russian town occupied by Ukrainian troops. Efrem Lukatsky/AP Experts agree the Kursk incursion has not fundamentally changed Putin’s overarching strategy of attrition – to exhaust Ukraine, and try to outlast its allies. And yet, Ukraine’s surprise move has emboldened those who had previously questioned the West’s policy of limiting certain types of military aid, and their use inside Russia. And that may well have been part of Ukraine’s strategy.  On August 19, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky allowed his closely held veil of gratitude towards his Western allies to lift momentarily. “The entire naïve, illusory concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia, which dominated the assessment of the war by some of our partners, has crumbled these days somewhere near Sudzha,” he told a gathering of Ukrainian diplomats, referring to a Russian town that Ukrainian troops had occupied. CNN Related article Ukraine aims to create Kursk ‘buffer zone,’ Zelensky says, as Kyiv’s forces blow up second Russian bridge His point is that Western fears that Russia may interpret the use of American or British long-range missiles on its soil as a conventional threat worthy of a nuclear response – Russian nuclear doctrine does allow for this – are now more remote than ever, given its lack of a coherent military response to its first foreign occupation since World War II. “The current NATO strategy for helping Ukraine is a strategy for defeat. It is just a strategy for perpetuating war and allowing Russia to wait us all out,” said Ryan. “We need a fundamental reassessment.” Former Russian diplomat Bondarev argues Putin’s own reaction serves as further proof that the West needs to formulate a more robust response to Putin’s aggression. “When some Westerners say we shouldn’t corner Putin because he will become a cornered rat and will fight back with all his might,” he told CNN. “Now we see that when he’s really presented with a crisis, he’s not a cornered rat, he’s just like an imposter. “And that’s why he should not be feared so much.”"

Communities in and around Pokrovsk are being urged to flee within the next two weeks as Russian forces push forward – which comes despite Ukraine’s own incursion into Russian territory that has taken Moscow by surprise. On Thursday, Russia insisted it had thwarted another Ukrainian attempt to push into the border region of Bryansk, as Ukraine continues to make advances into the Kursk region. Roughly 600 to 700 people have been evacuating daily, the administration said. On Thursday, the national rail network said at least 371 people evacuated from Prokrovsk by train, with the network having to add nine carriages to accommodate the large crowds. Evheniya, a 65-year-old resident in Pokrovsk who worked as a chef at a local restaurant, told CNN how she hears the sounds of blasts at night, but has no plans to leave the city. “At night [I hear] blasts and I sit up [in my bed]. [It’s] so scary when you are alone. I wait till it calms down, and just as I lay down – again,” Evheniya said. Meanwhile Natalya, a 69-year-old Pokrovsk resident, plans to flee soon with her son telling CNN that her “nerves are on the edge.” “When they declared evacuation the previous time, I didn’t leave,” she said. “It was more quiet, now situation is very different, much more tense.” Video Ad Feedback Video shows aftermath of Ukraine's latest attacks inside Russia 03:17 - Source: CNN In Ukraine’s Donetsk region, children with their parents or other legal guardians will be forcibly evacuated from certain districts, including Pokrovsk, according to the ministry responsible for the reintegration of regions that previously fell under Russian control. Pokrovsk is not a large city – about 60,000 people lived there before the war, and many have left since the start of the full-scale invasion. But it serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military thanks to its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center. The Ukrainian military said Wednesday that Pokrovsk is now “the hottest” front of the war. Troops are repelling Russian attacks and fighting in multiple locations. The entire community encompasses Pokrovsk city, the nearby town of Myrnohrad and 39 surrounding villages. “Don’t wait. It will not get better, it will only get worse. Leave,” was the stark warning from local official Yurii Tretiak, head of the military administration in Myrnohrad, which is now less than 3 miles from the frontline. But Tretiak said many people are still reluctant to leave – even going so far as to hide their children from local authorities, promoting the military administration to make house visits. “We have cases when parents hide their children. Today (August 20) we will have a meeting with the police to discuss how we will work with such people, how we will search for such parents who hide children and give false information that the children have long since left,” he said, noting that dangers are increasing with some areas of town facing daily attacks. “Those who hesitated a week ago have mostly decided and are leaving en masse,” he said, noting that for residents who have yet to evacuate, “the most common argument is that ‘I have nowhere to go’ or ‘no one needs me.’” “The enemy is advancing faster than expected,” Tretiak said in a radio interview on Tuesday. “So we are trying to do as much as possible to evacuate people by the end of the week.” Ukrainian troops use the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties toward Dnipro.

Can you imagine what it’s like to live here all your life and suddenly give up everything?” she said in the statement. While the communities in and around Pokrovsk remain under fire, the Russian Ministry of Defense on Thursday said Russian troops have occupied the eastern Ukrainian village of Mezhove as part of their ongoing offensive in the area. The ministry claimed that units from the Center group of Russian armed forces seized control of Mezhove, in the Donetsk region that was illegally annexed by Russia. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the situation in the village. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces are being reinforced in the eastern region to repel a potential Russian advance. In his nightly address, Zelensky said: “The frontline is our position, first of all Pokrovsk direction, our Donetsk region. We understand the moves of the enemy and are strengthening ourselves.” Ukrainian army medics treat wounded  soldiers at a stabilization point in the Pokrovsk direction.

Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) forces and military units responded to the Ukrainian attempt to break through, Bogomaz said, adding the area where the clashes took place is now stable and under Russian control. Last Sunday, Zelensky said Ukraine’s military incursion into Kursk aims to create a “buffer zone” to prevent cross-border attacks by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine has previously targeted the Bryansk region in operations launched since its incursion into Russia more than two weeks ago. Ukraine’s bold cross-border advance in Russia’s Kursk region has seen Kyiv’s troops claim over 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory and take out key bridges in the western part of the country. The assault – which poses a major embarrassment for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.

Speaking to Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Putin said Russia-China “large-scale joint plans and projects” in economic and humanitarian areas would “continue for many years,” according to a Kremlin readout. Li, China’s No. 2 official under leader Xi Jinping, had traveled to Moscow for a longstanding annual meeting with Russia’s prime minister, which focused on economic and practical cooperation as the Kremlin continues to look to Beijing for economic partnership as its war with Ukraine grinds on. In his remarks to Putin, the Chinese premier hailed efforts by the Russian leader and Xi to “inject strong momentum” into “deepening bilateral relations and cooperation,” according to Chinese state media. Li’s four-day trip, which will include a stop in Russian ally Belarus, is the first visit to Russia by a high-level Chinese official since the Kremlin’s war with Ukraine took on a new dimension following a surprise, ongoing military incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Russian border region of Kursk two weeks ago. Russia has been scrambling to repel that assault, which marks the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II and comes amid mounting pressure for a conclusion to the war in Ukraine, which began in 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor.

An official readout from the meeting released by China’s Foreign Ministry did not mention the war in Ukraine. Speaking to Li, Mishustin said Russia and China were “in a difficult external situation” as Western countries impose “illegitimate sanctions under far-fetched pretexts” and seek to “contain the economic and technological potential of Russia and China.” “That is why it is important to concentrate efforts on protecting our common interests, building a multipolar world order and strengthening coordination on international platforms,” he said, according to Russian state media. Record trade Beijing has faced mounting scrutiny and pressure from the West to curtail the export of dual-use goods such as aerospace, manufacturing and technology equipment to Russia, which Western leaders and Kyiv have alleged are propping up the Russian war effort. Chinese officials have sought to present the country as a neutral, aspiring peace broker in the war, but have had limited high-level contact with Kyiv while continuing to deepen relations with Moscow across trade, diplomacy and security. China last month hosted a top Ukrainian official for the first time since Russia’s invasion of the country nearly two and half years ago. Last week, in response to a media inquiry on the situation in Kursk, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry called on “all parties” not to expand the battlefield, escalate fighting and “fuel the flame,” saying China would continue to work for a “political settlement of the crisis.” Wednesday’s meeting between Li and Mishustin is part of annual talks held since 1996, typically focused on economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation and seen as a means to implement broader policy direction set by Xi and Putin.

Trump said in a speech in North Carolina: “Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine. She met with Putin, and then three days later, he attacked. How did she do? Do you think she did a good job? She met with Putin to tell him, ‘Don’t do it.’ And three days later, he attacked; that’s when the attack started. Did you know that, General?” (Retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was at the North Carolina event.) Facts First : Trump’s claim is false. Harris has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies , including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference. “Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said last month , according to a state-owned Russian news agency. The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany , Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.” CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.” The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022 ; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022."

Since the Ukrainian incursion began nearly two weeks ago, its forces are inching forward in Kursk and destroying key bridges in an effort to cripple Moscow’s logistical capabilities and disrupt supply routes. At least two bridges were taken out of action over the Seym River in Kursk last week. Ukraine said it had used “precision airstrikes” for one, and Russia claimed Kyiv had utilized Western rockets for the other. Afterward, Russia built at least three pontoon bridges – temporary floating ones often used in emergency or wartime situations – across the river, according to satellite imagery from Planet Labs and BlackSky. Since then, a Ukrainian drone has targeted one of the pontoons, according to a video obtained and geolocated by CNN.

BlackSky The type of drone used was designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating its warheads and destroying the drone in the process. Compared to traditional, larger military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, these ones are smaller and harder to detect, and can be fired from a distance. The video shows the drone hitting one of the vehicles used to set up and move the pontoon bridge. Though it’s not clear if the drone destroyed the vehicle, BlackSky satellite imagery on Tuesday showed that the bridge was gone – with large burn scars in the area where it was. On another section of the river nearby, a new pontoon bridge can be seen stretching across the water in satellite images. A third pontoon bridge was also seen in satellite imagery from the European Space Agency and Planet Labs. The Kursk offensive has left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. On Tuesday, Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said its troops had advanced up to 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 93 settlements. Russian forces in the area are battling hard against Kyiv’s shock incursion, a Ukrainian commander fighting in Russia’s Kursk region told CNN Wednesday, while claiming his own country’s troops are still making gains. “Ukrainian troops are still advancing as they used to. We are cleaning up the ground. We are now faced with the fact that enemy subversive groups are trying to ambush us and try to stop us,” Dmytro Kholod, the commander of Ukraine’s “Nightingale” battalion, told CNN in a phone call. “They no longer surrender by the hundreds. They are trying to shoot and fight back, but they still surrender when we attack them.” The commander added that Russia has brought in more artillery “and is using it much more than before,” but said Russian forces are failing to hit targets precisely. “They just shell forest belts and settlements where our troops are likely to be concentrated,” Kholod said.

Gen. Patrick Ryder said Russia has so far “really struggled to respond, and you continue to see some Ukrainian advances in that regard” – even as Moscow moves “a small number of forces” into the Kursk region. “It has certainly demonstrated the creativity and the battlefield prowess of the Ukrainians, but when it comes to what their longer-term objectives are here, that’s something that we’re still discussing with them,” he said. Ryder would not say where the US is seeing the Russian forces being moved from. CNN reported last week that Russia had diverted several thousand troops from occupied territory in Ukraine to Kursk. This satellite image shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack on a bridge in Glushkovo, Russia, on August 17, 2024. Planet Labs Russian authorities have also urged residents in the embattled border regions, as well as military and other personnel there, not to use dating apps or social media to prevent Ukrainian forces from gathering intelligence. “The use of online dating services is strongly discouraged. The enemy actively uses such resources for information gathering,” Russia’s Interior Ministry said in a Telegram post, as part of an advisory issued to residents and troops in the Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod border regions. It included a long list of recommendations – including not opening hyperlinks in messages from strangers, not streaming videos on roads with military vehicles and removing geotagging on their social media. Moscow drone attack Russian authorities also claimed Wednesday that their air defense systems had destroyed 45 Ukrainian drones overnight: including 11 over Moscow, two over the Belgorod border region and two in Kursk. “This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow with drones of all time,” Moscow’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a Telegram post Wednesday. Some of the drones were destroyed over the city of Podolsk, about 38 kilometers (24 miles) south of the Kremlin, Reuters quoted Sobyanin as saying. Preliminary information so far shows no injuries or damage, Sobyanin was quoted as saying. Reuters could not independently verify his remarks, and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on the Russian capital before – notably in July 2023 when drones struck two non-residential buildings, including one near the Ministry of Defense headquarters. There was no serious damage or casualties at the time, Sobyanin said afterward. And in November, Russia said it had foiled more than 20 Ukrainian drone attacks, including on Moscow – which came shortly after Russia launched i ts largest drone attack against the Ukrainian capital since the full-scale invasion began.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops had advanced up to 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault last week, capturing 93 settlements. More than 121,000 Kursk residents have been evacuated, Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations wrote on Telegram Monday. Ukraine’s operations also targeted the Bryansk and Belgorod regions. Apps reveal sensitive information The security risk stemming from social media use is not hypothetical — there is a history of soldiers inadvertently revealing sensitive information by using their phones in conflict zones. The United States and its “Five Eyes” intelligence allies – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom – warned last year that Russian military hackers had been targeting Ukrainian soldiers’ mobile devices in a bid to steal battlefield information. And when a high-profile Russian submarine commander was shot dead while jogging in 2023, Russian media reported he may have been targeted by an assailant tracking him on Strava, a popular running app. The officer, Stanislav Rzhitsky, was using a public profile under his own name to track his running and cycling routes. He was killed while out jogging on one of his regular circuits. And after a Ukrainian strike that killed nearly 100 Russian troops in the occupied Ukrainian city of Makiivka on New Year’s Day last year, Russia’s defense ministry said the “main cause” of the strike was the widespread use of cell phones by Russian soldiers, although some officials questioned that assessment. Last month, Russian state media TASS reported that the country’s lower house of parliament proposed punishing Russian soldiers caught using smartphones while fighting in Ukraine .

Maxim Shemetov/Reuters/File Related article Ukraine advances in Russia as Moscow mayor accuses Kyiv of ‘one of largest ever’ drone attacks The lawmakers suggested that carrying internet-connected cell phones that can help identify Russian troops or the location of forces should be classified as a “gross disciplinary offense” and be punishable by up to 10 days’ imprisonment. Multiple offenses could lead to up to 15 days in prison. The law would also prohibit the use of other electronic devices meant for “household purposes” that allow for video and audio recording and the transmission of geolocation data. It’s not just Russia and Ukraine though. The US Department of Defense banned military personnel from using geolocation features in 2018 after it emerged that Strava and other fitness tracking apps could pose security risks for forces around the world. The app created an interactive heat map that displayed 1 billion activity data points made public by users, inadvertently revealing the locations of US bases in countries around the world.

The defected soldier – with the call sign “Silver” – was an active serviceman for the unit “Storm” before volunteering for the Freedom for Russia Legion during the “winter of 2024,” the legion, a group of Russian dissidents fighting for Ukraine, said. Silver, a 24-year-old from Siberia who joined the Russian army in 2021, gave his reasons for defecting in an interview posted on YouTube by the “I Want to Live” project – a Ukrainian government initiative which receives appeals from Russian servicemen in Ukraine wishing to surrender. “I wanted to serve in the army, I gave an oath to protect my motherland. My motherland is there [in Russia] and no-one attacked it. I didn’t want to serve for Russia during the war and didn’t want to die for Putin,” he said. Silver took part in the fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Avdiivka area from the Russian side of the border as a drone operator, he explained in the interview. He had also previously served on China’s border with Russia. “Silver was a member of the resistance for several months and transmitted important operational information to us (the location of forces and equipment, plans, tasks in a specific section of the front, etc.),” the Freedom for Russia Legion said. CNN Related article Ukraine aims to create Kursk ‘buffer zone,’ Zelensky says, as Kyiv’s forces blow up second Russian bridge Escaping the Storm unit, Silver “activated explosive devices” in the unit’s headquarters, seriously injuring the commander and several senior officers, according to the legion. The legion posted a video to its YouTube channel taken from a hidden camera claiming to show the operation. Several men are seen in the video in army uniforms before an explosion erupts, causing a fire. “During the retreat, Silver mined the path and went along the agreed route. The legion command, together with the ‘I Want to Live’ team, organized Silver’s exit from the combat line. Now he is undergoing a basic training course as a legion recruit,” the Legion said. Ukraine’s intelligence department said the operation to get Silver out was named “Ocheret.” “The Russian was motivated to cooperate with Ukraine by the systematic war crimes and other crimes of the command, including extrajudicial executions, beatings, and robberies in the occupation unit,” the Defense Intelligence said on Telegram on Tuesday. Silver claimed in the interview that he had seen some Russian soldiers killed by their own commander. CNN is unable to verify this claim but has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. The Defense Intelligence said Ukraine was able to obtain valuable intelligence on the location, number, and intentions of Russian forces “in a particular frontline area” because of the interaction with Silver."

Ukrainian forces are inching forward in Kursk amid fighting following the launch of their surprise military operation there nearly two weeks ago. But Ukraine also remains under pressure in its occupied east as Russian forces advance toward a key military hub. The Kursk offensive has left Russia struggling to shore up its own territory. Kyiv seems to have multiple goals with the assault, from boosting morale after a torrid few months to stretching Russia’s resources. A Ukrainian presidential aide said the incursion aimed at ensuring a “fair” negotiation process. For the first time, Zelensky on Sunday stated the strategic ambitions of the operation, saying, “It is now our primary task in defensive operations overall: to destroy as much Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions.” Those include “creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory,” the president said in his latest address. “Everything that inflicts losses on the Russian army, Russian state, their military-industrial complex, and their economy helps prevent the war from expanding and brings us closer to a just end to this aggression,” Zelensky said. Speaking on Monday, Zelensky also suggested the incursion could give Ukraine leverage in securing the release of prisoners of war. During a meeting to discuss Ukraine’s incursion, acting Kursk governor Alexei Smirnov told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Kyiv’s forces had penetrated 12 kilometers (about 7.5 miles) inside Russia and now control 28 settlements within the Kursk region. More than 121,000 Kursk residents have been evacuated, Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations wrote Monday on Telegram, with more than 650 people leaving the region in the past 24 hours. Despite the shock of Kyiv’s incursion, Russia has continued to advance in eastern Ukraine and is closing in on the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region, where authorities are scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of residents. Kyiv’s foothold in Kursk is “getting stronger” with troops reinforcing their positions, according to Zelensky. Kyiv says it controls nearly 1,000 square kilometers (about 621 square miles) of Russian territory, and both Russia and Ukraine have urged residents to evacuate from areas where heavy fighting is ongoing. As part of efforts to cripple Moscow’s logistical capabilities and disrupt supply routes, Ukrainian forces said Sunday they blew up another bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, with “precision airstrikes.” “The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistics capabilities with precision airstrikes, which significantly affects the course of combat operations,” Ukrainian Air Force commander Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk said in a social media post that included a video showing plumes of smoke engulfing parts of the bridge. The attack comes two days after Ukrainian forces destroyed a first bridge over the Seym. Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had used Western rockets to carry out that attack, which were likely US-made HIMARS. HIMARS, or the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, has perhaps been the most revered and feared piece of weaponry in Kyiv’s fight and since arriving has helped Ukraine to take back significant swaths of territory from Russia. The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Sunday that Kyiv is making further gains in Kursk and shared a still image from a video, also geolocated by CNN, of what it said was a Ukrainian Defense Forces tank in the village of Olgovka, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the town of Sudzha. Kyiv’s forces took control of Sudzha last week and established a military commandant’s office there, according to Ukrainian military officials.

Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from frontline fighting in occupied Ukraine to address the territorial loss in Kursk. And residents who fled the area due to the fighting have been warned not to go back. “The operational situation on the territory of our district remains complicated. Some citizens are not giving up their attempts to return home, thus hindering the work of our military,” said the head of Kursk’s Korenevsky district, Marina Degtyareva, on Sunday. “Returning to the area so far is impossible for local residents, and sometimes results in terrible tragedies.” Authorities would tell residents when it is safe to return, she added. “I appeal to all residents of Korenevsky district, let’s be patient and let our military deal with the enemy, let’s not interfere with our defenders,” she said.

Oleksandr Klymenko/Reuters Russians reach outskirts of key city Despite Kyiv’s push further into Kursk, Russian forces are also advancing in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s army has moved closer to the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, which serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military because of its easy access to the town of Kostiantynivka, another military center. Ukraine uses the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties. Vadym Filashkin, head of the Donetsk military administration, said Monday that officials in Pokrovsk have started the “forced evacuation” of children and their parents as Russian troops close in on the city. More than 53,000 people remain in Pokrovsk, including 4,000 children, according to local officials. Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, warned earlier that residents have “1-2 weeks to leave, no more.” “The Russians are close, up to 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the outskirts of the town. The town is getting ready,” Dobriak said on Sunday. “Every town in Donetsk region has a combat unit assigned to it, and defense plans have been developed. We are working with the military to build fortifications. This is a continuous process.” Zelensky said Sunday that Ukrainian units “are doing everything to hold the positions” amid dozens of attacks on the front lines in Donetsk. The evacuation of civilians from Pokrovsk has been accelerated because of the approach of Russian troops. Nearly 1,800 people have been evacuated from the city over the past week alone; until recently 450-500 residents were being evacuated every month. “The Russians are destroying our towns and villages, killing civilians, so we need to think about our safety and evacuate,” Dobriak said. “Currently, the town is being hit by missiles, MLRS, and there have been several guided aerial bomb attacks.” A woman walks past a house that was destroyed after a Russian strike on a residential area in Pokrovsk on August 3. Thomas Peter/Reuters Ukraine’s Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Sunday urged residents of Pokrovsk and other settlements “in the immediate vicinity of the front line” to evacuate and “leave for safer regions.” Vereshchuk said she understood residents would have to leave their jobs, homes and property, but “nevertheless, the lives and health of you and your children are more valuable,” and staying in the area would interfere with the work of the defense forces.

Over the past week, Russia used more than 40 missiles, 750 guided aerial bombs and 200 attack drones against Ukrainian cities and villages, Zelensky said Sunday. “For such terror, the occupier must be held accountable before the courts and history. They are already facing the strength of our warriors,” Zelensky said. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Ukrainian army chief, told Zelensky, “Our guys are doing great on all fronts,” but he called for Ukraine’s Western partners including the United States, the United Kingdom and France to deliver supplies quicker. “There are no vacations in war,” Syrskyi said.

His forthcoming visit to Ukraine - also his first since the start of the war – comes at a crucial moment, as Kyiv’s troops push further into Russian territory in a shock military offensive that stunned even Kyiv’s closest allies. Modi has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, without condemning Russia’s aerial campaign or denouncing the ground invasion. India has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Modi will visit Ukraine on August 23 at the invitation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, India’s Ministry of External Affairs announced Monday. “The upcoming visit of Prime Minister Modi to Ukraine will provide an opportunity to hold discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations,” the ministry’s secretary for the West, Tanmaya Lal, said in a briefing. The secretary reiterated that India has “maintained a very clear and consistent position that diplomacy and dialogue can resolve this conflict.” She said that “lasting peace” can only be achieved through a negotiated settlement. Modi’s trip will also include a visit to Poland on August 21-22 – the first by an Indian prime minister in 45 years, the ministry said.

The remarks appeared to be his most critical comments to date against Russia’s war in Ukraine. “Whether it’s conflict, war or terror, any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die,” Modi said while seated alongside the Russian president. “As a friend, I have always said that peace is necessary for the prosperity of future generations, but I also know that on the battlefield, solutions aren’t easy to come by between guns, bombs and bullets.

US officials told CNN that Russia has diverted thousands of troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter the threat. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has had to bring in conscripts, backpeddling on a promise he made not to use them on the frontline. A sizeable trench has been dug across countryside near the town of Selektsionnyi, around 45 kilometers (about 28 miles) from the border, in Kursk, satellite imagery showed.

Maxar Technologies After trenches were built, west of Lgov, Russia, on August 12. Maxar Technologies Trenches, west of Lgov, Russia Maxar Technologies Experts told CNN that Ukraine’s bold gambit to breach Russia’s border, planned in complete secrecy, had stunned even Kyiv’s closest allies, including the United States, shifting the playing field of a more than two-year-old war. But after months on the backfoot, losing ground in grinding battles in their own territory, just how were the Ukrainians able to catch Moscow by surprise and penetrate the Russian homeland? First: superb operational security. Nothing about the operation leaked. Based on videos from the ground and satellite imagery of their advance, the troop movements almost seemed like an exercise or a defensive reinforcement. “[Ukraine has] demonstrated that they can pull off such a secretive and significant operation successfully, they can penetrate Russian territory so this is no longer the red line, and they … are still very much committed to fight for their country, that there is no such thing as war fatigue, and they’re willing to take these, in a way, extreme measures for the sake of defending their country,” Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the UK’s Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies (RUSI), told CNN. The force was built up under cover of thick summer foliage along the rural roads of Sumy region, in northeast Ukraine. Experienced, battle-hardened units were brought up or diverted from other areas. Units such as the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, which had until recently been fighting in nearby Kharkiv region, were pulled into the mission to breach the border, according to multiple videos and social media accounts. Among the detailed preparations was precise intelligence on the readiness and ability of Russian units on the border, and the number of obstacles that lay ahead, from minefields to tank traps. There weren’t many. Ukrainian forces also used detailed knowledge of the geography to launch the attack, using forest belts for cover and roads for speed. It was only in the last days before the incursion began that commanders were briefed on the mission. “The key, in terms of Ukraine’s success, [was that] they managed to penetrate Russian territory quite easily with little to no resistance. It was a complete surprise for the Russians, and it demonstrates that Russian intelligence services really failed to foresee any sort of Ukrainian incursion into the region,” said Seskuria. Having established weak points in Russian defenses, the first Ukrainian units stormed into Kursk on the afternoon of August 6. Videos on social media, which were geolocated by CNN, appear to show dozens of Russian soldiers immediately surrendering at the heavily damaged border crossing south-west of the town of Sudzha, located 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk. Dozens of Russian soldiers appear to surrender in videos geolocated by CNN to a border crossing south-west of Sudzha, Russia. Social media Serhii Sternenko , a Ukrainian vlogger who shared the video on his Twitter and Telegram channels, said it showed at least 22 Russian soldiers “surrender” in the Kursk region. CNN was unable to confirm the identity of those shown in the footage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had taken control of Sudzha – the first official confirmation that the troops, which have been in the town since last Wednesday, had captured it. The town is an important transit point for gas supples from Russia to Europe via Ukraine. Satellite images showed a gas terminal at a nearby border point in ruins. 2024 Planet Labs Inc. In their charge across the border, Ukrainians have used fast, resilient western-made armored vehicles: Strykers and Marders. Small mobile groups of special forces swiftly fanned out to dozens of locations as the Russian military scrambled to assess the strength of the assault. Key to their success: air defenses and supporting artillery, as well as jamming to prevent the Russian military from communicating. Thermal protection for their body armor also helped soldiers evade heat-detecting drones. Within hours of crossing the border, the Ukrainians were close to Sudzha. Many of its residents were sent scrambling on hair-raising escapes, some cursing the Russian military for abandoning them. As the operation unfolded, Ukrainian soldiers posted video of themselves in front of village signs before vanishing, part of a parallel campaign of psychological warfare. CNN geolocated numerous videos showing Ukrainian forces posing in front of road signs and taking down Russian flags at village halls across the Kursk region, including in Porozovsky, Plekhovo, Sverdlikovo, Guyevo and Sudzha .

Social media “I think that has a great value in terms of information warfare because these images, videos that we see … that is a really good morale boost for Ukrainians,” said RUSI’s Seskuria. Rather than confront Russian units head-on, advanced Ukrainian units bypassed them, cutting them off. The Russian military command struggled to keep up with where the threat was emanating from. At the same time, the Ukrainians trained their attention on Russian reinforcements, wiping out one convoy of 14 Russian military vehicles near Rylsk with a missile attack.

Social media The head of Ukraine’s armed forces,  Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Thursday that Ukrainian forces had  captured 1,150 square kilometers (about 444 square miles) of territory and 82 settlements since the start of the surprise incursion. More than a week after the incursion began, the Ukrainians were still probing for weaknesses, consolidating their hold on a band of territory 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) deep – even providing Russian civilians with emergency food aid. The assault has put Ukraine in charge of a Russian civilian population. Television News Service via Reuters Seskuria told CNN that Ukraine’s incursion is partly a “self-defense measure … because Kursk region, due to its location, has been used many times to launch missiles on Ukrainian territory.” “[Ukraine’s] strategic aim would be to divert Russian forces from offensive operations in the Donetsk oblast, where Russians have been making some advances in the recent months… that would be an obvious intention, to ease the military pressure in Ukraine.” Seskuria added that Ukraine’s recent activity might provide Ukraine with “a better negotiating position when it comes to any sort of peace talks in the future.” Indeed Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Zelensky, said the incursion was aimed at persuading Russia to enter a “fair negotiation process.” Russian military bloggers are apoplectic about the lack of readiness and the slow response to the incursion. The Russian Defense Ministry insisted this week it was repelling Ukrainian advances and taking prisoners, but Russia’s reinforcements were struggling to retake ground, outmaneuvered and hit with missiles and artillery. Can Kasapoğlu, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC, told CNN he did not foresee a Ukrainian withdrawal anytime soon. “The offensive is culminating, and the battleground is stabilizing. Nonetheless, the Ukrainian military has already secured operational depth. If they can set robust defensive positions … they can stay inside Russian territory for a long time,” he said. Kursk would be Ukraine’s “crown jewel” when negotiating an end to the conflict, Kasapoğlu added, if Kyiv manages to hold on to the seized territory.

Ukraine has used US weaponry and vehicles as part of its offensive, according to officials, even though the Biden administration did put boundaries on the use of US weaponry in Russia, according to two US officials. The officials would not detail the exact boundaries the US drew but said Ukraine had not “technically” breached the US-imposed limitations. US-made Humvees were seen entering Russia’s Kursk oblast through the Ukraine-Russia border crossing near Sudzha, Russia, on Tuesday in a Reuters photograph. Ukraine has also used HIMARS rocket launchers as part of the operation, officials said, but the vehicles appear to have remained in Ukrainian territory, using the range of its GMLRS missile to hit Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense released drone video on Thursday, showing a HIMARS rocket-launching vehicle firing missiles in a wooded area just under five miles from the Russia-Ukraine border. The US’ restrictions on the use of long-range ATACMS missile has not changed, US officials said. Ukraine has used the missiles to strike Russian air defense systems in Russian-occupied Crimea. On Friday, Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had likely used HIMARS to destroy a bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, adding the strike killed volunteers trying to evacuate civilians.

Pro-Russian Telegram channels have circulated images claiming to show a destroyed Ukrainian convoy in the Kursk oblast. CNN is unable to determine the exact location where the photos were taken, but one of the destroyed vehicles is a US-made Cougar MRAP. One US official said Ukraine’s military has used US-made Stryker combat vehicles capable of moving infantry across a battlefield. Video released by the Russian Ministry of Defense claims to show a military strike hitting a US-made Stryker vehicle in a wooded area, but CNN could not verify the claim. On Friday, Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ssaid the Ukrainian military, already some 35 kilometers into Russian territory, is still advancing “in some areas from 1 to 3 kilometers.” The operation has put the Kremlin on the defensive, forcing Russia to bring in troops from the front lines to repel the ongoing Ukrainian raid. “Overall, the situation is under control. All activities are being carried out according to plan,” Syrskyi said. The US drew a box north of Ukraine from which Russian forces were carrying out attacks and instructed Kyiv to keep their use of American weapons contained to that area, according to two US officials. The officials would not describe the exact location of the geographic box or its size, but they said Ukraine’s incursion has remained within its borders, and the operation has not violated US policy regarding the use of American weapons on Russia. Because the operation has remained within the agreed upon area, officials say it has not “technically” breached US-imposed limitations.  One official said the Ukrainian offensive follows the “letter of the law” when it comes to US policy but acknowledged it’s “not what we had in mind.” The US has not publicly taken a position on Ukraine’s maneuver, which officials say has had a “surprising” amount of success. The Biden administration has not instructed Kyiv to pull back its forces into Ukraine, nor has it thrown its full support behind the operation. Instead, the administration has been careful in stating openly that it will continue to back Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.

Equally surprising, officials said, is the Kremlin’s slow response to the incursion, the first time Russia has lost sovereign territory since invading Ukraine more than two years ago. Russia appears to have diverted at least several thousand troops away from front-line fighting in occupied Ukraine in order to address the territorial loss in the Kursk region. One US official said Russia will likely end up having to send more troops to the area to strengthen its own defenses, as the US watches to see where Russia will find the manpower. Meanwhile, senior US officials have tried to gain a better understanding of Kyiv’s goal in carrying out the offensive into Russia. Ukraine did not inform the US in advance of the incursion, and the US is still not clear on what the long-term goal is for the operation. On Friday, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the cross-border incursion is aimed at creating a “fair negotiation process” and inflicting “significant tactical defeats” on Russia. “Negative changes in the psychological state of the Russian population will be another argument for the start of negotiations,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on social media. Russia’s reaction may be delayed, officials said, but there is little doubt that a response is coming. Ukraine says it has seized approximately 400 square miles of territory inside Russia, forcing Russian authorities to declare emergencies and carry out large-scale evacuations. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, Wednesday and tried to learn more about the objectives of the offensive, launched nearly two weeks ago. “Throughout the department, we are engaging with the Ukrainians trying to get a better understanding of their objectives,” said deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh. Pressed on whether Austin told Umerov that he supports the operation, Singh demurred. “What I can tell you is where we are supportive and that is Ukraine continuing to defend itself,” she said."

While Pokrovsk is not a major city – about 60,000 people lived there before the war and many have left since the start of the full-scale invasion – it serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military thanks to its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center. Ukrainian troops use the road connecting the two to resupply the front lines and evacuate casualties toward Dnipro. Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, urged the community there to evacuate without delay. “The enemy is rapidly approaching the outskirts of Pokrovsk,” he said in a Telegram post on Thursday. His warning is proof that Moscow has not relented in its attack on other parts of Ukraine, despite Kyiv’s successful incursion across the border over the past week, a major development after two-and-a-half years of open conflict. Ukraine said it has captured more than 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault, forcing tens of thousands of Russians from their homes. On Friday, Russia’s foreign ministry said Ukraine had used Western rockets for the first time to destroy a bridge over the Seym river in the Kursk region, adding the strike killed volunteers trying to evacuate civilians. HIMARS, or the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, has perhaps been the most revered and feared piece of weaponry in Ukraine’s fight and since arriving have helped Ukraine to take back significant swaths of territory from Russia. Ukraine has used US weaponry and vehicles as part of its push into Russian territory, according to US officials, even though the Biden administration did put boundaries on the use of US weaponry in Russia. Ukraine officials said its military, already some 35 kilometers into Russian territory, is still advancing “in some areas from 1 to 3 kilometers,” on Friday. Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from frontline fighting in occupied Ukraine in order to address the territorial loss in the Kursk region. But according to Dobriak, the enemy is “almost right up close” to Pokrovsk, Ukraine’s key logistics and military hub that has become the focus of the Russian offensive in the Donetsk region. Medics of the Ukrainian battalion ""Da Vinci Wolves"" prepare an ambulance for the evacuation of wounded at their base in the direction of Pokrovsk, Ukraine, on August 1, 2024. Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu/Getty Images “They are a bit more than 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles) from the outskirts of Pokrovsk,” he said, adding that the situation “is only getting worse.” For months, Russia has been stretching Ukrainian defenses across the entire front line, trying to capture as much territory as possible before new Ukrainian recruits and fresh batches of Western weapons start arriving on the battlefield. The gains made by Russia have been largely incremental – the front line has barely moved in the past few months – but the recent advance toward Pokrovsk has Ukraine and its allies worried. The city’s capture would bring Russian President Vladimir Putin closer to his goal of seizing all of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. Kostiantynivka is the southernmost part of a belt of four Ukrainian cities – with Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – that form the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses of the region, so any progress of Russian troops toward the city is significant. Officer of Ukraine’s 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade Serhii Tsehotskyi told Ukrainian national broadcaster Suspilne on Friday that Ukraine’s incursion into Russia had not led to a decrease in Moscow’s attacks in the Donetsk region. He said Russian attempts to advance do not stop “for a minute,” and “the battles continue around the clock.” Ukrainian servicemen in an undisclosed area in the Pokrovsk district, the eastern Donetsk region, on August 8, 2024.

Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged Friday that “intense fighting” is taking place in the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Thursday that Russian forces are “maintaining their relatively high offensive tempo” in Donetsk, “demonstrating that the Russian military command continues to prioritize advances in eastern Ukraine even as Ukraine is pressuring Russian forces within” the Kursk region.

Sudzha, Russia CNN — Bodies decomposing in the street. Bullet-marked civilian cars lining the road. Half of Lenin’s face blown away from the statue on the square. Streets littered with shrapnel. Locals huddling in a bomb shelter. The smell of death, in buildings torn open. It is a scene achingly familiar to Ukraine, yet until now alien to Russia. But t he border town of Sudzha was assaulted by Ukraine eleven days ago and claimed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday as under their control. When Russian President Vladimir Putin began his war of choice two years ago, Russia did not expect to get invaded back. CNN crossed into Russia accompanied by the Ukrainian military, past the border post torn to shreds by Ukraine’s first attack. With the skyline ahead occasionally marred by black smoke from explosions, the road itself was surreally calm. On either side, tranquil fields once protected by a Cold War superpower that had not seen an invasion since the Nazis. The turnoff into Sudzha was marked with a huge Orthodox Christian cross, upon which was written “God save and protect us.” Yards away lay the wreckage of two tanks and other armor from the intense fighting days earlier. The town’s streets were mostly vacant, yet echoed with the storm raging around them. Small arms fire and outgoing artillery broke the silence, but at a distance.

Viacheslav Ratynskyi/Reuters Related article Ukraine captures Russian town of Sudzha as Kyiv’s forces advance, Zelensky says Our Ukrainian escort said the Russian attack drones that had blighted Ukraine’s progress on the front lines in the past months were simply too busy at the frontline battles to harass Kyiv’s forces at the border and in Sudzha. Their conspicuous absence, and that of Russian air power, suggested a possible improvement in Ukraine’s capabilities for this surprise assault. The ubiquity of Western-supplied armored vehicles on the roads into Russia showed Ukraine was throwing resources it had long claimed it lacked into this fight. Sudzha was not completely deserted. At one large building, outside the basement entrance, a large cardboard hand-written sign announced, “Here are peaceful people in the basement, no military.” Inna, 68, sat outside. There were 60 other civilians downstairs, she said. “They brought a lot of boxes, their food,” she said of the Ukrainian forces. In the basement was a scene we have witnessed in dozens of Ukrainian towns over the past two years, and still as saddening in Russia. At the entrance to the shelter was Stanislav, who stroked his gray beard when asked how life was. “See, this is not life. It is existing. It is not life.” In the dark, subterranean dank were the infirm, isolated, and confused. One elderly woman, still in her wig and bright red summer dress, rocked slightly as she intoned: “And now I don’t know how it will end. At least a truce so we can live peacefully. We don’t need anything. It’s my crutch, I can’t walk. It’s very hard.” Flies buzzed around her face, in humid gloom. In the next room, the light flickered on a family of six. The man said, “A week. No news. We don’t know what’s happening around us.” His son sat silent next to him, his white face stony. At the end of the corridor, talking to one of our Ukrainian escorts was Yefimov, who said he was in his 90s. His daughter, niece and grandchildren are married to Ukrainian men and live in Ukraine, yet he cannot reach them. “To Ukraine,” he said, when asked where he wanted to flee. “You are the first to mention it. People talked about it but you are the first to come.” The idea of evacuation would be arduous for many here in peacetime. On the street outside is Nina, 74, searching for her medication. The shops are shredded and pharmacies closed. She insists she does not want to leave, with the same passionate defense of her right to live where she always has as so many Ukrainian women of her age, in similar scarred towns. “If I wanted to I would. Why would I leave where I lived 50 years? My daughter and mother are in the graveyard and my son was born (here), my grandkids…  I live on my land. I don’t know where I live. I don’t know whose land this is, I don’t understand anything.” It is unclear how and where this fast, successful and surprise assault ends, or when Russian forces arrive. Yet they will be too late to reverse another dent in Russia’s pride since it began an invasion meant to take only a matter of days in February 2022."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/europe/russia-putin-war-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html,Putin promised poorly trained conscripts wouldn’t be sent to war. Now the front line has come to them,"Messages on social media have revealed how unprepared Moscow was for this kind of attack, leaving conscripts in charge of defending the border with Ukraine.","Aug 16, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Ivana Kottasová,Ukraine,"CNN — Russian President Vladimir Putin made a big promise when he launched his war on Ukraine: conscripts would not be involved in combat. But as Moscow struggles to contain Ukrainian advances deeper into its territory, families of young soldiers deployed in the area are raising the alarm about their loved ones. Messages shared in Russian Telegram channels and other social media over the past few days have revealed how unprepared Moscow was for this kind of attack, including the fact that its military had left poorly trained conscripts in charge of defending the border with Ukraine – the country Russia has been waging war on for more than 10 years. “When the border was attacked at 3 a.m. by tanks, there were only conscripts defending themselves,” said one such message shared on Telegram by a woman who said she was a mother of a conscript soldier in Kursk, the border region that Ukrainian troops crossed into last week . “They didn’t see a single soldier, not a single contract soldier — they didn’t see anyone at all. My son called later and said, ‘Mom, we’re in shock;,” the woman, identified only as Olga, said. CNN has asked Russia’s defense ministry for comment, but has not received an answer. The deployment of conscripts is a thorny issue in Russia. That’s partly because of Putin’s repeated promises that they would not be sent to fight, but also due to fact that the mothers and wives of soldiers have traditionally been an influential voice inside the country where dissent is now almost nonexistent – and many are expressing their anger. The independent Russian news outlet Verstka published an interview with Natalia Appel, the grandmother of one Russian conscript who was serving in Kursk and is now considered missing. She said her grandson Vladislav had been stationed – without any weapons – in a village some 500 meters from the border. “What could the boys do? Go against (the Ukrainian soldiers) with a shovel?,” she was quoted as saying. Russian conscripts called up for military service depart for garrisons from a recruitment centre in Bataysk, Russia on May 16, 2024. Sergey Pivovarov/Reuters A petition calling on Putin to remove conscripts from the area has been shared online and dozens of messages from people who claimed to be family members of Russian conscripts who have gone missing in Kursk region have been posted on various social media, including the Russian network VKotante . The fact that Russia was relying on conscripts to defend the border is likely why Ukrainian troops managed to advance into Russian territory with such apparent ease when they first launched the incursion last Tuesday. Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Ukrainian troops have advanced 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the incursion started. “We have taken control of 1,150 square kilometers of territory and 82 settlements,” Syrskyi told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during an on-camera staff meeting Thursday. Limited training, no weapons All healthy men in Russia are subject to conscription and, if drafted, required to serve one year in the military. The country’s military usually runs two drafts a year, one in the spring and one in the fall, conscripting well over 100,000 young men each time. Draft avoidance is a crime and can be punished with a prison term. The treatment of conscripts has been a political third rail in the past for Russia. During the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and Russia’s war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, the mothers of conscripts mobilized to campaign against the abuse of conscripts. While Russian civil society has largely been defanged under Putin, the treatment of conscripts is still a sensitive issue for families. Avoiding the draft is easier for the sons of the wealthier and politically privileged. Last year, Putin ordered the conscription age to increase by three years to 30, so that anyone between the ages of 18 and 30 could be drafted. Unlike professional soldiers, conscripts receive only limited training before they are sent to their posts, as the law prohibits their deployment overseas and they are not meant to participate in combat operations. Instead, the Russia has often stationed conscripts along its long borders, not expecting them to ever come under attack. But when Ukraine launched its recent surprise incursion, these conscripts suddenly found themselves on the frontline, completely unprepared to defend themselves. The deployment of conscripts to the border was also criticized by Russian opposition leaders. The Anti-War Committee of Russia, a group formed by exiled Russians, issued a statement on Wednesday criticizing the Russian president. It said “the absence of any significant military units of the Russian Federation on the border at the time of the attack and the simultaneous continuous conduct of aggressive military operations for more than 900 days on the territory of sovereign Ukraine is the best proof that Putin is lying again about ‘protecting Russia.’ He doesn’t care about Russia, he is only protecting himself.” Ukrainian servicemen operate an armored military vehicle in the Sumy region near the border with Russia on August 12.

In addition to the troops moved from inside Ukraine, Russia has also sent personnel from the Leningrad military district and Kaliningrad, in Russia, to help defend Kursk, one of the senior US officials said.

Anatoliy Zhdanov/SIPAPRE/AP Conscripts taken prisoner At least some of the conscripts appear to have been taken as prisoners and brought to Ukraine. Zelensky confirmed earlier this week that Kyiv’s forces were taking prisoners of war as they continued to advance into Kursk. The Ukrainian military also released several videos and photos of men they claimed were Russian prisoners of war – some of whom appeared to be very young men. On Thursday, the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, a government department, said a company of Russian soldiers surrendered in the Kursk region and was taken prisoners after being abandoned by reinforcements. The capture of Russian soldiers was the biggest imprisonment Kyiv had carried out against Moscow forces in one go, a source at Ukraine’s security service (SBU) told CNN on Thursday. A video captured by Agence France-Presse near the border showed a Ukrainian military truck carrying a group of blindfolded men wearing what appear to be Russian military uniforms. But while there seems to be outrage over their deployment, this is not the first time Russian conscripts were found to be fighting in Putin’s war on Ukraine. Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia’s Ministry of Defense admitted that conscripts were “discovered” in Ukraine after Kyiv announced that some of the prisoners of war it took were not professional soldiers. The Russian military then claimed the conscripts had been withdrawn and returned to Russia. It said the commanding officer responsible for the deployments had been punished.

Kyiv’s forces have been in the town, located 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk, since last Wednesday, but this is the first confirmation from the Ukrainian president that his army had captured it. Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops have advanced 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 1,150 square kilometers of territory and 82 settlements. Syrskyi said a military commandant’s office has been set up in Sudzha “to maintain law and order and meet the priority needs of the population in the controlled territories.” Sudzha is located next to a Russian gas terminal, a key point for supplying gas from Russia, via Ukraine, to Europe. This has prompted speculation that one of Kyiv’s goals could be to curtail a lucrative source of funding for Moscow. Ukraine’s ground incursion has forced tens of thousands of Russians from their homes and put Russia on the back foot as it scrambles to repel Kyiv’s troops. Wednesday saw Ukrainian drones target four Russian airfields in the largest such attack of the war. A source in Ukraine’s security service told CNN the attack targeted four bases in the southwest regions of Kursk and Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow. Russia’s defense ministry said it destroyed 117 “aircraft-type” drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk and neighboring regions. Ukraine’s assault – which poses a major embarrassment for the Kremlin – represents a notable change in tactics for Kyiv, marking the first time foreign troops have entered Russian territory since World War II.

The development has drawn American attention and US officials are now working to determine precisely how many troops Russia is moving, but sources said multiple brigade-sized elements made up of at least 1,000 troops each appeared to have shifted to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an operation last week. “It is apparent to us that Mr. Putin and the Russian military are diverting some resources, some units, towards the Kursk Oblast to ostensibly counter what the Ukrainians are doing,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Thursday. The Russian troop movements away from Ukraine “doesn’t mean that Mr. Putin has given up military operations in the northeast part of Ukraine or even down towards the south, towards places like Zaporizhya,” Kirby said. “There’s still active fighting along that front.” But the movements have raised the tantalizing possibility that what originally appeared to be a quixotic bid by Ukraine to humiliate Russian President Vladimir Putin could have a more significant strategic impact on the battlefield, depending on how long Ukraine is able to hold the Russian territory. The Ukrainian operation has impressed American officials, particularly the way the Ukrainian military was able to keep its details so secret—the incursion even caught US officials by surprise, officials said. While the operation has risked softening some of Ukraine’s own defenses along the 600-mile frontline, it may also divert Russian troops who have been making some incremental gains inside Ukraine through the summer, sources added. Ukraine says it has captured over 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault, forcing tens of thousands of Russians from their homes. A senior US official and a senior European intelligence official both said a major goal of the operation appears to be to create “strategic dilemmas” for Putin, particularly when it comes to where Russia should allocate manpower. Still, Russia is believed to have hundreds of thousands of troops on the frontline in Ukraine, so diverting a few thousand may not have a large impact in the short term, officials said. Russia also does not appear to be moving its larger and better-trained units away from Ukraine and into Kursk just yet, said two other sources familiar with western intelligence. One of those sources said Russia appears to instead be bolstering Kursk’s defenses primarily with untrained conscripts taken from elsewhere in Russia. “We haven’t seen a substantial move [of Russian troops] just yet, and we can’t tell whether that’s just because they’re only just getting started moving forces, or whether they just don’t have the forces to move,” said one of the sources familiar with US intelligence. In addition to the troops moved from inside Ukraine, Russia has also sent personnel from the Leningrad military district and Kaliningrad, in Russia, to help defend Kursk, one of the senior US officials said. Even as they acknowledged the limited success of the Kursk operation thus far, multiple US and western officials familiar with the latest intelligence cautioned that Ukraine is extremely unlikely to be able to hold the territory for long and emphasized that it’s too soon to judge how the operation will affect the broader outcome of the war. The US also remains reluctant to allow Ukraine to use long-range, US-provided weapons inside Kursk, multiple officials said—not because of the risk of escalation, but because the US only has a limited supply of the long-range missiles, known as ATACMS, to provide to Ukraine and thinks they would be better used to continue targeting Russian-occupied Crimea, officials said. Some officials also raised concerns that Ukraine, which one western official said has sent some of its more experienced forces into Kursk, may have created weaknesses along its own frontlines that Russia may be able to exploit to gain more ground inside Ukraine. “It’s impressive from a military point of view,” the official said of the Kursk operation. But Ukraine is “committing pretty experienced troops to this and they can’t afford to lose those troops.” “And having diverted them from the front line creates opportunities for Russia to seize advantage and break through,” this person added."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the military for the attacks, which he described as “precise, timely and effective,” in a video address released the same day he said Kyiv’s forces had captured Russian soldiers in southern Russia and destroyed a Russian fighter jet. “Our Ukrainian drones work exactly as they should. Still, there are things that cannot be done with drones alone,” Zelensky said. A source in Ukraine’s security service told CNN it was the “biggest attack” on Russia’s airfields since the war began and targeted four bases in the southwest regions of Kursk and Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow. It comes as Ukraine’s massive ground incursion has forced tens of thousands of Russians from their homes and put Russia on the back foot as it struggles to repel Kyiv’s troops.

In Belgorod, which neighbors Kursk, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov declared a regional emergency Wednesday, calling the situation on the ground “extremely difficult and tense” in a message on Telegram. Residents began evacuating Monday because of Ukrainian advances. Regional authorities are now appealing to the Kremlin to declare a federal emergency, Gladkov said.

And we continue to work with our partners on long-range solutions for Ukraine.” Ukraine’s Western partners have been reluctant to supply Kyiv with long-range missiles that can penetrate deep into Russian territory. Zelensky said his forces had advanced in Russia’s Kursk region by 1 to 2 kilometers since the beginning of the day and had captured 100 Russian servicemen. Kyiv has already claimed to have control over some 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault.

Now they have to deal with it. I hope that it will not be in vain and that we will get peace.” Ukraine ’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Kyiv’s forces were pushing farther into Russia after claiming hundreds of square miles of its territory. Kyiv said its troops have been expanding on a “buffer zone” inside Russia, which they say will better protect communities in northern Ukraine. Fedorkovska, 21, came to the evacuation center with her 72-year-old grandmother, who was inconsolable after leaving her husband and the home they’ve shared for 52 years.

Fedorkovska, a student, said her 85-year-old grandfather insisted on staying behind, telling her: “You save your grandmother, and I will guard what we own.” The surprise counteroffensive brought a much-needed boost for Ukraine’s military, but it has also left some Ukrainians, including Fedorkovska and her grandmother, worried about what will happen once Russia gathers enough troops to the area to push back. “I wish our guys good luck, because if they do not hold on to the (Russian) lands they have now seized, I think there will be a lot of troubles in Sumy region. It will be the second Mariupol, I think,” Sergey Zemlyakov, a former soldier who fought in the eastern Donbas region in 2014 and 2015, told CNN at the evacuation center. Mariupol, in the Donetsk region, fell to Russian control in 2022 following months of besiegement and bombardment, thousands of reported deaths, and tales of horror and starvation. Russian aerial attacks Nila Buhaiova, who works at the Department of Social Protection in the Sumy regional administration, said hundreds of people came through the center’s doors in recent days. “The evacuation has intensified over this past week … when the shelling of the Sumy district started, people could not stay anymore, so they left. On Friday there were 270 people, on Saturday 382, and on Sunday 250,” she said. The numbers are dwarfed by the evacuations on the Russian side of the border. Local officials in the Kursk region said some 180,000 people there have been put under evacuation orders, with thousands more evacuated from neighboring Russian regions. But for many Ukrainians, it’s hard to feel sorry for their neighbors. Fedorkovska’s grandparents stayed in their home in Myropillya after the war broke out in 2022, even though the village is surrounded by Russia’s Kursk region on three sides and has been under frequent attack ever since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

But the attacks with guided bombs and aircraft have intensified. Now they can’t reach us with artillery, so they shoot from the aircraft,” Fedorkovska said, explaining why her grandmother had finally decided to evacuate. “We want people to understand what it’s like to live under constant shelling, to live in a place where you have lived your whole life, a place you put your heart and soul into, where you raised your children, went to school … and that you are forced to leave and move somewhere else because there’s constant shelling now.” Olena Lozko is an accountant from the Ukrainian village of Velyka Rybytsia, which sits about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Russian border. She too has left in recent days amid the intensifying attacks by Moscow’s forces. “We are very happy that our soldiers are attacking, but we are very scared. We have nowhere to go, and we are very afraid of these glide aerial bombs,” she said. “The situation is getting worse.” Russia’s FAB-1500 guided glide bomb is a 1.5-tonne weapon nearly half comprised of high explosives.

The explosions left gas billowing from Nord Stream 1 and 2 – two major conduits that transported Russian gas to Europe – and prompted a huge operation to find who was responsible. A spokeswoman for Poland’s Public Prosecutors Office, Anna Adamiak, confirmed Poland had received a warrant from Germany seeking the arrest of a Ukrainian man, named as Volodymyr Z. She added that he had left Poland and was not arrested because he was not on a database of wanted people. The news comes after three German outlets reported that the man – described as a male diver - along with two other Ukrainian suspects, are believed by German federal prosecutors to have launched an audacious underwater attack on the pipeline from a sailing boat in September 2022. After a joint investigation, German outlets ARD, Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Wednesday that the arrest warrant for the man had been sent to Poland’s government to approve in June. Germany’s Federal Public Prosecutor General did not comment on the reports when contacted by CNN. Die Zeit reported that the man denied involvement when contacted by the outlet. The origin of the explosions has been a subject of intense speculation and further stoked political tensions in Europe seven months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Neither of the pipelines were actively transporting gas to Europe at the time of the leaks, though they still held gas under pressure. Investigators found evidence of explosives at the sites in November 2022, leading Swedish prosecutors to conclude that the blasts were caused by an act of sabotage. According to the new German media reports, investigators in Germany believe that the sailing boat set sail from Rostock, Germany in September 2022, stopping in Denmark, Sweden and Poland, with a six-person crew including five men and one woman. During that voyage, the crew is reportedly suspected of diving into the Baltic Sea and attaching explosives to the massive Nord Stream pipelines, which subsequently detonated and damaged both lines, according to the outlets. Last year, three US officials told CNN that the US had received intelligence from a European ally that the Ukrainian military was planning an attack on the pipelines three months before they were hit. The New York Times meanwhile reported in 2023 that intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a group loyal to Ukraine, but acting independently of the government in Kyiv, were involved in the operation. Ukraine’s government has always denied any involvement in the blasts. The Nord Stream project had been controversial long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Several Western countries, among them Poland, raised fears it would increase Moscow’s influence over Europe. Germany nonetheless championed the expensive multimillion dollar, 750-mile second pipeline, before eventually pulling the plug on the plans after Russia’s invasion, just as it was set to become operational.

Tens of thousands of Russians have been forced to flee their homes as Ukrainian troops continued to encroach onto Russian territory over the weekend and on Monday. The incursion – the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II – is a major embarrassment for the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to “kick the enemy out” or Russia, but his troops are yet to stop the Ukrainian advance. Here’s what we know. What happened? The first reports of Ukrainian troops crossing into Russia’s Kursk region, just north of the Ukrainian border, started to emerge late last Tuesday. But it wasn’t until several days later that Kyiv officially acknowledged its military was operating inside Russia. The incursion marked a notable change of tactics from Kyiv. The Ukrainian military has in the past regularly attacked targets inside Russia with drones and missiles, and there have been limited cross-border attacks by Ukraine-aligned Russian saboteurs, but until last week it had not launched any official ground incursions across the border. By Monday, Kyiv claimed to have control over some 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory. In terms of its size, it’s similar to the amount of Ukrainian land Russia managed to seize so far this year, estimated by the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) at 1,175 square kilometers (453 square miles). Still, the area is dwarfed by the more than 100,000 square kilometers, or 18% of Ukraine’s total territory, taken by Russia since the conflict started in 2014. Why is Kyiv doing this? The objective of the incursion remains a mystery. Kyiv is likely trying to achieve several goals: reclaim the initiative and boost the morale of its soldiers while diverting Russia’s attention and embarrassing Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said over the weekend that the incursion was a way to put  “pressure on the aggressor.” Residents of an apartment building damaged after shelling by the Ukrainian side stand near the building in Kursk, Russia, Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024. (AP Photo) AP Related article Ukraine’s Russia gambit punctures Putin’s veneer of invincibility once again On Monday, he added that it was “only fair” and beneficial to destroy the Russian positions that are used to launch strikes against Ukraine, saying thousands have been launched from the Kursk region since the beginning of June. “Russia must be forced into peace if Putin wants to continue waging war so badly,” he said. The Ukrainian government said it didn’t intend to annex Russia’s territory in the same way Moscow has annexed Crimea and other areas seized from Ukraine. “Unlike Russia, Ukraine does not need (foreign territories). Ukraine is not interested in taking the territory of the Kursk region. But we want to protect our people’s lives,” spokesperson for the foreign ministry Heorhii Tykhyi said on Tuesday. Ukraine has been under increased pressure along the 600-mile front line as Moscow in recent months, even as the long-awaited US military aid started to arrive to the front. Moscow’s slow, grinding offensive along the entire frontline has been forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive. While Russia’s advances have been mostly incremental, it has recently managed to inch towards several strategically important towns and roads in eastern Ukraine. How has Putin reacted? With fury. The scale of the crisis became clear on Monday, when Putin held a tense meeting with top security and government officials and the heads of the border regions, vowing to “kick the enemy out.” A video of the meeting published by the Kremlin shows Putin scolding his subordinates, at one point shutting down the Kursk region’s acting governor Alexei Smirnov as he attempts to outline the scale of the invasion. Smirnov was telling Putin that the Ukrainians were some 11 kilometers deep into Russian territory when Putin cut him off saying he can get that information from the military and ordered him to focus on social and economic issues instead. Putin is not used to having his authority and power challenged and the incursion is the second major humiliation for the president in just over a year, after the Wagner mutiny last June. While the private mercenary group’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin ultimately failed and ended up dead after trying to challenge Putin, the episode caused a major crack in the image the president has been cultivating for decades. What does it mean for Russia? The magnitude of the crisis cannot be underestimated. For more than a decade, since Russia sparked the conflict in eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the war Moscow has been waging on Ukraine barely touched the Russian people. Widespread sanctions imposed by the West on Russia made international travel difficult and foreign goods expensive or innacessible, but the sense of safety from foreign attack has remained more or less intact. That changed once Ukraine began using drones and missiles to regularly strike deeper inside Russia earlier this year, especially after Kyiv got permission from some of its allies to use their weapons for cross-border strikes. The ground incursion makes it even more apparent. Moscow has been scrambling to contain the attack. Russian authorities imposed a sweeping counter-terror operation in three border regions – Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk – but stopped short of declaring the incursion an act of war. The ISW said this was likely an attempt by the Kremlin to deliberately downplay the assault to prevent domestic panic or backlash over the fact that Russia was unable to defend its own borders. Ukrainian servicemen operate in the Sumy region near the border with Russia, on August 12, 2024. Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty Images What are Ukraine’s allies saying? Putin has lashed out against Ukraine’s allies on Monday, claiming the “the West is fighting us with the hands of the Ukrainians.” Yet everything seems to suggest that the incursion took by surprise not just Russia, but also some of Ukraine’s closest allies. The Biden administration said last week it wasn’t made aware of Kyiv’s plans in advance, but it reiterated its support for Ukraine. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said: “Make no mistake about it: This is Putin’s war against Russia. And if he doesn’t like it, if it’s making him a little uncomfortable, then there’s an easy solution: He can just get the hell out of Ukraine and call it a day.” Similarly, the European Union, Germany, the UK and other Western countries expressed support for Ukraine. What happens next? Analysts are not expecting Ukraine to attempt to advance much further into Russian territory. The success of the incursion was largely down to the surprise factor, with Moscow scrambling resources to try to defend its borders. Once Russian reinforcements are in place, it is unlikely Ukraine would be able to hold onto the territory it managed to seize. Russia has already relocated some of its troops stationed in occupied southern Ukraine to the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military officials. Ukrainian Ground Forces Spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovii told Ukrainian media Tuesday that “some Russian military units” were moved to Kursk from the Pridniprovsky frontline and the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine. He caveated, however, that Russia had already amassed “a large number of personnel” in the Zaporizhzhia region. “The number of units they are redeploying is relatively small to talk about any weakening or removal of the barrier to continue the offensive in the southern direction,” Lykhovii told Ukrainian TV outlet EspresoTV. “We want to avoid the impression that we are already winning and that Kursk is ours. This is not the case at all. We emphasize that every segment and every area is important.” Ukraine has spent the past few months trying to hold off further Russian advances, first while waiting for the long-delayed deliveries of US weapons and now as it awaits the newly recruited troops to get trained up and arrive to the front lines. The incursion might have given it the boost it so desperately needed. CNN’s Olga Voitovych and Sugam Pokharel contributed reporting."

Two months ago, as Russian troops poured into Kharkiv region, Kyiv was eyeing its borders, concerned at where else Russia might find vulnerabilities. Yet instead, Ukraine appears to have looked at the map, decided Russia was equally exposed, and turned Moscow’s gambit on its head. A week in, and whatever the final outcome of Ukraine’s invasion of Russia, Kyiv’s initially perplexing, perhaps even rash, decision to send thousands of troops into the Kursk region and beyond is paying stark dividends. For the second time in just over a year, the Kremlin has a hostile force marching in its south, and very little it can do about it. Last June, it was the homegrown rogue mercenaries of Wagner, headed to Rostov and on, to decapitate Russia’s top brass. Now, it is Ukraine’s own military, scything off what they claim is 1,000 square kilometers of border territory. Some analysis at the weekend put the figure at about a third of that. Nevertheless, the ability of Ukraine’s commander Oleksandr Syrskyi to even float this claim is a remarkable win in the information war for Kyiv, even if Moscow severely limits what information Russians are exposed to. “Bold, brilliant, beautiful,” was what veteran US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Ukraine’s cross-border operation during a visit to Kyiv Monday. Meanwhile, US Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal called it “historic” and a “seismic breakthrough.” The events are remarkably similar in how they expose the gulf between the veneer of impregnability the Kremlin tries to portray, and the ramshackle reality of its power. And while Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march on Moscow fell apart when the former chef finally seemed to realize he was on his own – and had enraged Putin, rather than gaining his approval for tackling the failing top brass head-on – Ukraine’s forces seem to have little but their own supply lines and ambition holding them back. Ukraine’s lightning advance is another example of their forces’ dexterity and mobility in warfare, over Moscow’s preference for slow, months-long grinding attacks on the same place. It is purposefully unclear exactly where Ukraine’s forces are. Videos pop up from towns far inside Russia, but without context. One overnight emerged from Lgov, about 26 miles from the border, with a soldier saying he promised his mother he would not go far. It is also unclear where Ukrainian forces are digging in and where they are just racing through. The lack of transparency in the Russian system – where mistakes and problems are hidden rather than addressed head-on – works in Kyiv’s favor. It is unlikely Moscow, or even Kursk’s governor, knows the full picture of the mess they are in. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg/Getty Images And the news the Kremlin is getting is uncharacteristically dire. When Kursk acting governor Alexei Smirnov told Putin on state TV on Monday that 28 settlements were under Ukrainian control, with 2,000 people’s fate unclear, and 121,000 residents evacuated, it’s likely the moment was staged and pre-recorded, like most of Putin’s televised meetings. But to what avail? Putin turned the question towards his military chiefs, who he’s slowly decimated over the 30 months of this war’s ebb and flow. They clearly do not have the solution yet. But still Putin tries to play the role of the tsar adjudicating between chaotic and failing departments, despite on Wednesday being assured by his chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, that the Ukrainian advance had been halted. The last time this sort of invasion of Russia happened, Joseph Stalin was in charge, and he did something other than televise his failing leadership. Two questions remain. The first regards the ultimate fate of Ukraine’s incursion. Do they intend to try and hold even the smallest amount of terrain? Do they intend to keep raging across undefended spaces? And how much firepower, manpower, and precious Western-supplied equipment is Ukraine happy to indulge this effort with? The merits of the assault are less in doubt than a week ago when it was first launched. Putin has a bloody nose. But the Ukrainian endgame needs to be as carefully engineered as the invasion to capitalize on Kyiv’s success. The second is what impact does this have on Ukraine’s more challenged frontline in Donbas? During the past week, the successes of Kursk region have been peppered with worse news from Toretsk, or near Pokrovsk, as Russian forces continue their costly, bloody, yet inexorable advance. No matter how small the village, Moscow just keeps attacking. So far, Ukraine’s hope the Kursk operation would lead better units to be withdrawn from Donbas to support Russia’s borders has yet to bear major fruit. As images continue to pour in of poorly trained Chechen troops being taken prisoner en masse by advancing Ukrainians in Kursk, it is clear Russia has sent its less effective units into the fight. They may choose to change that approach. Putin has also entrusted the operation to the FSB, the internal security service that also controls the border guard, which has instituted a “counter-terror operation.” This has previously been used to tackle Islamist insurgencies, not columns of Ukrainian armor. That, too, may have been very short-sighted. Manpower crunch But soon the crunch for Kyiv emerges. Where does this leave its forces a month from now? Has the talk of a manpower crunch over the past months been because they were secretly holding forces in reserve for this assault? Do they extract a strategic advantage great enough from these advances that Moscow’s view of them as a defeated adversary changes? Does the advance make their Western supporters decide the support is truly paying off? Regardless of how efficiently Ukraine answers these questions, Russia has for the second time in 15 months been rudely humiliated. Firstly it was by Putin’s own loyalists, egotistically turning on corruption and mismanagement. This time it is Putin’s own FSB, who couldn’t keep control of the borders, in Putin’s war of choice. This falling tree may not make a sound in the heavily managed forest of Russia’s political space. Yet it probably hit others as it fell. One fact endures however. Both Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia’s Putin have referenced the incursion in terms of its role in talks. Putin said Ukraine was trying to improve its position ahead of talks – talks that still appear to lack an agenda, or a date, or any sense of trust between parties. Residents of an apartment building damaged after shelling by the Ukrainian side stand near the building in Kursk, Russia, on Sunday. (AP Photo) AP For his part, Zelensky said on Monday: “How useful this [incursion] can be for bringing peace closer.” He added: “Russia must be forced into peace if Putin wants to continue waging war so badly.” Kyiv knows it cannot enter talks with Russia without a strong hand, as the wildly deceptive negotiating style of the Kremlin has proven they simply stall for time unless they urgently need something from their interlocutor. Still, even if Syrskyi only has half of the 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) he claims, a change in season to fall is no more than six weeks away, and with it the sludgy slowing of motion on the battlefield. Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive last summer has been eclipsed by the sudden success of this August incursion. The dismal fortunes of last winter are not behind them yet, but they may approach the next with a better hand, and at the very least the idea of the Kremlin’s invulnerability - first broken in their failed initial invasion - shattered for at least the third time in this war."

The scale of the incursion became clearer on Monday when Putin held a meeting with local officials from the border regions as well as some of Russia’s top security, government and law enforcement personnel. The acting head of the Kursk region, Aleksey Smirnov, told Putin that 28 settlements in his region were now under Ukrainian control, adding that Ukrainian troops had managed to advance some 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) into the territory across a 25-mile (40-kilometer) wide stretch of the border. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Monday that some 386 square miles (1,000 square kilometers) of Russian territory were now under Ukrainian control. Putin said the incursion was an attempt by Ukraine to “improve its negotiation position.” “But what kind of negotiations can we even talk about with people who indiscriminately strike at civilians, at civilian infrastructure, or try to create threats to nuclear power facilities. What can we even talk about with them?” Putin said. CNN cannot independently verify Putin’s claims that Ukraine has struck civilians in the incursion. Over the course of the war, Russia has been repeatedly accused of targeting Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure by Kyiv, its Western allies and by international bodies, including the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. Russia has denied the accusations, despite evidence. Putin went on to tell his security chiefs to expel the Ukrainian forces: “The main task is certainly before the Ministry of Defense: to squeeze out, knock out the enemy from our territories and, together with the border guard service, ensure reliable protection of the state border.” The Ukrainian advances have sparked a large wave of evacuations from the border regions. Smirnov said 180,000 people had been told to evacuate and that 121,000 have left already. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the neighboring Belgorod region in southern Russia, said people living in the Krasnoyaruzhsky district were being moved to safer places. “We’re having a disturbing morning – enemy activities on the border of Krasnoyaruzhsky district. I am sure that our military will do everything to cope with this threat. But to protect the life and health of our people, we are beginning to relocate people who live in the Krasnoyaruzhsky district to safer places,” he said in a statement posted on his official Telegram channel. About 11,000 residents from Krasnoyaruzhsky district were evacuated, the head of the district administration, Andrey Miskov, said later. A photo provided by the government of Russia's Kursk region shows people from the border districts of the region boarding evacuation buses. Government of Kursk/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The incursion, which is now affecting two Russian regions, is seen as something of a game-changer in the conflict. The Ukrainian military has in the past regularly attacked targets inside the Belgorod region with drones and missiles, but until last week Kyiv had not launched any official ground incursions across the border in the two and half years since the start of the full-scale war. The extent of the operation remains unclear. An influential Russian military blog Rybar said on Monday that “apparently the (Armed Forces of Ukraine) is not shying away from plans to stretch our defensive formations, create the maximum number of points of tension, and attempt to break through in the east to cut Belgorod off from the north.” A view shows a building on fire in the town of Sudzha following an incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region, Russia, in this still image from video taken August 7, 2024.

A video geolocated by CNN posted on social media over the weekend shows Ukrainian soldiers holding their flag outside a rural social club in Poroz, a village that sits in Belgorod region about a mile from the international border. Several Russian military bloggers reported an attempt by Ukrainian armed forces to attack a border crossing in the Belgorod region Monday morning, in the district that Russian authorities say is being evacuated. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry for comment. The operation, which started last Tuesday, has been shrouded in mystery. Ukrainian officials for days remained silent, refusing to comment on reports of Ukrainian troops operating inside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky finally confirmed Kyiv’s troops had crossed into Russia on Saturday, saying in his nightly address to the nation that “Ukraine is proving that it really knows how to restore justice and guarantees exactly the kind of pressure that is needed – pressure on the aggressor.” On Monday, he said “Russia must be forced into peace if Putin wants to continue waging war so badly.” Zelensky reiterated that it is “only fair” and beneficial to destroy the Russian positions that are used to launch strikes at the Ukrainian territory and reminded that thousands of strikes have been launched from the Kursk region alone since June 1. “Therefore, our operations are purely a security matter for Ukraine, the liberation of the border area from the Russian military,” he noted. Diversionary tactic? The reason for the attack is also unclear. Ukraine has been under increased pressure along the 600-mile front line as Moscow continues its slow, grinding offensive , inching towards several strategically important towns and roads in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff said Russia was targeting Toretsk, a strategic town just north of Donetsk. Toretsk lies on the southern end of a key road that connects Kostyantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, three Ukrainian cities that form the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses of the region. According to two Ukrainian military bloggers, Russian forces are pushing into Toretsk from several locations, trying to outflank Ukrainian forces. One blogger said Russian forces were already operating within the city. Russian military bloggers suggested a similar strategy, claiming Moscow’s armies had advanced in several locations around the town. CNN could not independently verify their accounts but video geolocated by CNN showed Russian forces operating just south of the city. The Ukrainian cross-border attack could be an attempt by Kyiv to divert Russian resources elsewhere. Given the spate of more negative developments from the front lines, the news of a successful incursion may help Kyiv boost the morale of its troops and civilian population. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitoring group, say the situation at the front in the East remains largely unchanged, with Russian forces still retaining momentum and continuing on the offensive despite Ukraine’s push in the Kursk region. Putin accused Ukraine of trying “to destabilize” his country, according to the Kremlin, adding that “a primary military objective” of the incursion is “to halt the advance” of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. He said currently “the pace of offensive operations” in the East “has actually increased by 50%” and the Russian troops are advancing “along the entire front.” Moscow has been scrambling to contain the attack. Russian authorities imposed a sweeping counter-terror operation in three border regions – Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk – but stopped short of declaring the incursion an act of war. The ISW said this was likely an attempt by the Kremlin to deliberately downplay the assault to prevent domestic panic or backlash over the fact that Russia was unable to defend its own borders. “Russian President Vladimir Putin has refrained from officially declaring a state of war, has repeatedly demonstrated his unwillingness to transfer Russian society fully to a war-time footing, and has forgone declaring general mobilization as part of wider efforts to prevent domestic discontent that could threaten the stability of (his) regime,” the ISW said in its update. The counterterrorist regime officially gives Russian authorities wider powers, including the ability to monitor telephone conversations and restrict communications and limiting the movement of people.

Zelensky posted a video showing a large plume of smoke coming out of one of the towers on the plant’s territory. He said radiation indicators were normal but blamed Russia for using the nuclear plant “to blackmail Ukraine, and all of Europe and the world.” “We are waiting for the reaction of the world, we are waiting for the reaction of the IAEA,” he said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Russia must be responsible for this.” Yevhen Yevtushenko, head of the Ukrainian-controlled military administration in the Nikopol district, which looks out onto the plant, said there was unofficial information that Russian forces had set fire to a large number of automobile tires in the cooling towers. He called it “a provocation, or an attempt to create panic” and reassured that the plant is “operating as normal as possible under the conditions of occupation.” Russia, in turn, accused Ukraine of starting the fire on the plant’s territory.

AP Related article Zelensky confirms Ukrainian troops are fighting inside Russian territory The Russian-appointed official in control of occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeniy Balitsky, said the fire occurred “as a result of shelling of the city of Enerhodar by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” Balitsky also said there is no radiation threat to the nuclear plant or the city of Enerhodar. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian-installed Zaporizhzhia administration, said Kyiv forces launched an attack drone from the Ukrainian territory to strike the power plant and called it “a targeted and deliberate blow.” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of “nuclear terror” following the attack and urged the IAEA to respond. The Russian-installed communications director of the nuclear plant, Evgeniya Yashina, told state media TASS that there were no victims following the strike. However, the plant “suffered serious damage for the first time,” she said. TASS reported that “the non-functioning cooling tower No. 1 was damaged, and plastic steam traps caught fire following the Ukrainian drone strike,” citing the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The fire “did not affect the operation of the plant in any way,” and employees of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations are working on its elimination, the plant’s Russian-backed Telegram page said. The IAEA issued a statement on X on Sunday following the incident. “IAEA experts witnessed strong dark smoke coming from ZNPP’s northern area following multiple explosions heard in the evening. Team was told by ZNPP of an alleged drone attack today on one of the cooling towers located at the site. No impact has been reported for nuclear safety,” it said. The incident came after Zelensky confirmed Kyiv’s troops are fighting inside Russia , days into the surprise Ukrainian cross-border incursion into Russia’s Kursk region that has become a major embarrassment for the Kremlin. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the border region of Belgorod with airstrikes and pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups have conducted limited cross-border attacks, but the Kursk operation marked the first time that regular Ukrainian and special operations units have entered Russian territory. “Ukraine is proving that it really knows how to restore justice and guarantees exactly the kind of pressure that is needed – pressure on the aggressor,” Zelensky said on Saturday, thanking “every unit” of Ukraine’s armed forces for making it possible “to push the war out into the aggressor’s territory.” Moscow has been scrambling to contain the attack. Russian authorities imposed a sweeping counter-terror operation in Kursk and two other border regions and tens of thousands of people have been evacuated.

We also document every missile strike,” he said adding that “every one of these strikes deserves a fair response.” Recent Ukrainian missile and drone strikes on Russia show that Kyiv has been living up to Zelensky’s words.

Russia strikes Kyiv The surprise attack in Kursk, which Putin called a “major provocation,” has been a significant win for Kyiv as it continues to struggle to hang onto its territory along parts of the 1,000 kilometer frontline. Moscow has pushed on with its slow, grinding offensive , edging closer in recent weeks to several strategically important towns and roads in eastern Ukraine. Early on Sunday, Moscow launched drone and missile attacks against Kyiv region, according to local officials. A four-year-old boy and his father were killed in a Russian strike in Brovary, just east of the capital city, the officials said, adding that another child was seriously injured.

He called the incident “a provocation” and said “the general staff of Belarus has been ordered to take relevant measures to ensure the security of the state.” “Ukrainians show in this way that they are not ready for peace and continue to escalate this tension,” Lukashenko said, speaking of the recent Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory. Khrenin told journalists “considering the situation in Ukraine and in the Kursk region of Russia” Lukashenko “has ordered to strengthen the grouping of troops” in the Gomel and Mozyr areas bordering Ukraine “in order to respond” to Ukrainian “provocations.” “Military units of special operations forces, ground troops and rocket forces, including ‘Polonez’ systems and ‘Iskander’ (ballistic missile) complexes, have been tasked with marching to the designated areas. Air defense, rocket defense and aviation forces and assets have been built-up,” Khrenin said. On Saturday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry summoned the Charge d’Affaires of Ukraine and “lodged a strong protest” in connection with the incident, the ministry said in a post on X. “The Ukrainian diplomat was warned that in case of repetition of such provocations #Belarus reserves the right to take retaliatory steps to protect its territory,” the ministry said, adding it “may question the necessity of the continued presence of the #Ukrainian diplomatic mission in Minsk.” The ministry blamed Ukraine for “criminal actions” to “radically escalate the situation and represent a dangerous attempt to expand the zone of the current conflict in our region.” It asked the rest of Europe to not escalate the situation. Ukraine has not publicly commented on Belarus’ accusations. “We appeal to the peoples of neighboring Europe: in the event of an expansion of the conflict, the fire will spread throughout the region, including to the EU countries. There will be no winners!” the ministry said on X. Belarusian state media BelTA said Saturday the Foreign Ministry will initiate consultations with allies and partners, as well as international organizations following the incident."

The video, released Wednesday by the Kremlin, showed the Russian president was not happy with news from the southern region of Kursk . At that moment, hundreds of Ukrainian troops, backed by tanks and protected by air defenses, were advancing into the region. Russian soldiers were surrendering; hundreds of Russian civilians in and around the town of Sudzha were fleeing with anything they could grab. In two-and-a-half years of warfare, it was an unprecedented Ukrainian incursion into Russia. Putin told the Kremlin meeting that it was “another major provocation” by Kyiv. The region’s acting governor declared a state of emergency, describing the situation as “very difficult.” Above all, it was humiliating for a Russian state that prides itself on protecting the motherland.

Mic Izvestia/IZ.RU/Reuters Related article Video shows bodies on burnt-out Russian trucks in Kursk region as Ukrainian cross-border assaults rage The Kursk attack was an audacious and counter-intuitive move from the Ukrainian military, what one analyst describes as “doing the least obvious thing.” Despite steadily losing ground in eastern Donetsk, it chose to send elements of experienced brigades into Russian territory, with the apparent goals of embarrassing the Kremlin and forcing the Russian Defense Ministry to redeploy resources and providing the home front with a much-needed morale boost. George Barros at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War says the Ukrainians “achieved operational surprise against great odds and are currently exploiting Russia’s lack of readiness in its border areas.” (The same tactic worked in September 2022 when they recovered much of occupied Kharkiv region within a week.) The Russian regiment tasked with defending this part of the border abandoned its positions. Several dozen soldiers were taken captive, leading President Volodymyr Zelensky to express Friday “special gratitude to our warriors and units who are replenishing the ‘exchange fund’ – by taking the occupiers as captives and thus helping to free our people from Russian captivity.” A column of Russian reinforcements was taken out by a missile attack near the town of Rylsk on Thursday night, possibly because the Ukrainians had managed to hack into multiple traffic cameras that are a feature of Russian highways. One Russian blogger, Aleksander Kots, said he had driven the route. “I noticed that there are cameras working along the entire highway. They are literally blinking their lights.” Meeting little resistance, and with Russian communications in the region reportedly jammed by effective electronic warfare, the Ukrainian brigades pushed more than 20 kilometers (12 miles)﻿ inside Kursk in the first two days of the operation. Good intelligence allowed advanced units to move still further forward in a somewhat chaotic battlefield, often bypassing Russian defenses. By Friday Russian authorities had lost control over at least 250 square kilometers of territory, according to several independent analyses and CNN’s mapping. This wasn’t just a patch of empty Russian countryside. Among the places that came under Ukrainian control was a natural gas transit hub near the border through which Russia supplies Europe with substantial volumes of natural gas. On Friday, a Ukrainian military Telegram channel declared the facility “under the control of the 99th mechanised battalion of the 61st Mechanized Brigade,” one of the experienced units involved in the assault. A video showed soldiers in front of the building, but Gazprom said Saturday that the pipeline was still operating. Inside Russia, the sort of anger that had greeted setbacks at the beginning of the war was rekindled. Andrey Gurulyov, a former commander in the region, reposted a comment on Telegram that demanded military prosecutors investigate decisions by commanders to transfer units from the Kursk region ahead of the attack. And there was resentment amongst Russian civilians in the region, thousands of whom fled their homes. The head of the city of Rylsk – some distance from the most advanced Ukrainian units – said Friday more than half the population of 15,000 had left. Social media videos illustrated the frustration among civilians at the sluggish response of the military; some appealed directly to President Putin. An expeditionary force Ukrainian troops, even if reinforced, cannot expect to occupy several hundred square kilometers of Russian territory. This is very much an expeditionary force, albeit a battle-hardened one, that has exploited the absence of organized resistance to make ground quickly. But holding a large chunk Russian territory is beyond their capacity and probably beyond their goal. Russian reinforcements will eventually make their mark, even if it takes them longer than three days to begin effective defense. On Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry said units had “thwarted the attempts of the enemy’s mobile groups to get to the depth” of Russian territory near Ivashkovsky, Malaya Loknya, and Olgovka in the Kursk region. Olgovka is 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the border.

Emil Kastehelmi at the Black Bird group in Finland, which uses open-source intelligence to track the conflict says “time is running against Ukrainians – (the) Russians won’t be disorganized forever.” Even if the Ukrainians need to pull back from more advanced positions, such an operation still serves several purposes. Barros says it “exposes some of Russia’s planning assumptions and critical vulnerabilities.” And Matthew Schmidt, who has taught strategic and operational planning at the US Army’s Command and General Staff College, said the Ukrainians’ “creative use of force was designed to put pressure on the decision-makers in Moscow” – and possibly cost some of them their jobs. Russian military blogger Vladislav Shurygin crystallized all this in a Telegram post Friday, saying that the enemy had “very skilfully and accurately chosen a different strategy - taking advantage of the bureaucratic rigidity and sluggishness of the Russian management system, to exhaust Russia with continuous unexpected strikes on sensitive infrastructure and the civilian population, provoking discontent, disappointment and apathy.” A view of a building on fire in the town of Sudzha following an incursion of Ukrainian troops into the Kursk region, Russia, in this still image from video taken August 7. Mic Izvestia/IZ.RU/Reuters The Kursk operation also demonstrates to Ukraine’s allies that it still has the energy and imagination to surprise its enemy and embarrass the Kremlin at a time when much of the news from the frontline was bleak for Kyiv. That’s not lost on Shurygin. “The goal of this new strategy is to put Russia before the prospect of an increasingly costly war (financially, reputationally and organizationally) and to force it to negotiate peace by November-December.” Daniel Fried at the Atlantic Council says there is a long history of such surprise military raids – some inconsequential and others impactful. He recalls George Washington’s daring maneuver to cross the Delaware River in 1776, when he returned with captured prisoners and supplies and raised morale for the fight against the British. Fried, a former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, says that by demonstrating Russia’s failure of intelligence and weakness along its border, the raid had punctured the Kremlin’s narrative “that Ukrainian resistance is useless and support for Ukraine is futile.” Ukraine’s Kursk gambit forces the Russian Defense Ministry into some tough choices. It appears that existing groups in Kursk such as the National Guard, FSB and irregular elements are unable to combat the Ukrainians. Barros told CNN that the military command may redeploy elements of the recently created Northern Grouping but the redeployment of significant elements “would likely further stretch these elements and create vulnerabilities in Russian defenses elsewhere along the border.” Alternatively, it may call on Russia’s substantial reserves in a larger-scale operation – but these are critical for current Russian offensive operations inside Ukraine, where the continuous commitment of high numbers of troops has eroded Ukrainian defenses. Or, Barros says, the Russians may turn to aviation to attack Ukrainian armor inside Kursk, thereby preventing Ukrainian forces from consolidating positions and assisting current Russian forces deployed in the area. Whatever combination the Russians choose, they are trying to reverse a humiliating episode in the conflict just as sheer mass and air superiority in eastern Donetsk was beginning to deliver incremental progress, underpinning the Kremlin’s insistence that Ukraine give up four eastern regions as a condition for negotiations. “The unfolding events demonstrate the extent to which Moscow has deeply depended on sanctuary in Russian territory to wage its war against Ukraine,” Barros told CNN. “Russia has undermanned its borders and border fortifications, relying on its perception of safety because it has not felt vulnerable.” Across a southern border with Ukraine that is hundreds of miles long, that perception has been seriously, and unexpectedly, challenged.

In the daytime video – shared by Russian military bloggers and independent outlets, and geolocated by CNN – about a dozen trucks are seen on the side of a road in the village of Oktyabrskoye, about 8 kilometers (5 miles) east of the town of Rylsk, appearing to contain dozens of dead bodies. Some of the trucks are completely burnt out, while others are undamaged but still appear to contain the bodies of military personnel. The video, which a Russian military blogger says shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian strike Thursday night, comes three days after Kyiv shifted tactics with a surprise incursion into Russian territory, prompting the Kremlin to declare a “federal scale” state of emergency on Friday in a region largely untroubled by more than two years of war. Other online forums provided a window into the scale and geography of the incursion. Telegram channels Belarusian Silovik and Archangel Spetsnaza reported fighting around Korenevo, a town about 30 miles northwest of Sudzha, an initial focal point of Ukrainian operations. Dnevnik Desantnika, another Telegram channel, reported that fighting was ongoing near the village of Malaya Loknya, about 11 miles north of Sudzha, and between Cherkasskoe Porechnoe and Russkoe Porechnoe, around 18 miles north of Sudzha. Rybar, one of the more prominent Russian military blogs, published a roundup of developments Friday that said the front lines have “somewhat stabilized” with the arrival of Russian reinforcements. Rybar cited local residents of Vtoroye Knyazhino, a settlement on the outskirts of Sudzha, as saying Ukrainian infantry entered their village.

Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty Images Moscow is firing back though. In one of the deadliest attacks in weeks, at least 14 people were killed and 43 injured in a Russian strike on a supermarket in Kostiantynivka, a town near the frontlines in the eastern Donetsk region, local officials said Friday. Although Moscow has needed no pretext to target civilian areas in Ukraine, such strikes have typically come after setbacks or humiliation on the battlefield. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a rescue operation is underway to free people trapped under the rubble. “Russia will be held accountable for this terror, and we will do our best to ensure that the world continues to stand with Ukraine in supporting our defense and saving the lives of our people,” he wrote on social media. Shifting tactics Although pro-Ukrainian groups of Russian nationals have mounted fleeting cross-border assaults on Russia, and Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the border region of Belgorod with airstrikes, this week’s incursion marks the first time that regular Ukrainian and special operations units have entered Russian territory. The intention, according to US and Ukrainian officials, is partly to divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front – from which they have been able to bombard Ukraine’s Kharkiv region – and partly to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces. US officials say they do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long term. On Thursday, Kursk residents wrote on Telegram that “huge, furious battles are underway,” and recorded a video address to Russian President Vladimir Putin asking for his help. Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said it had sent an additional group of 80 rescuers, including bomb disposal specialists, to Kursk on Friday to help evacuate the population to safe areas. Ukraine typically does not take responsibility for attacks on Russian territory, but on Friday President Volodymyr Zelensky made an indirect reference to the incursion, saying he wanted to “express my special gratitude to our warriors.” “This is extremely important and has been particularly effective over the past three days,” he said. “We must return freedom to all our people who remain in Russian captivity.” A view shows a damaged house following what local authorities called a Ukrainian military strike, in the course of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the town of Sudzha in the Kursk Region, Russia, in this handout image released August 6, 2024.

The source said dozens of fighter jets and helicopters were on the airfield at the time, and that a powerful explosion had led to a huge fire breaking out. Lipetsk’s emergency ministry also reported a fire at a military airfield in the region. “The enemy is hitting civilians in Kursk and Belgorod,” Artamonov wrote on Telegram. “Today [it] massively attacked our region with drones. We will not be frightened, we will not give in, but we are not going to risk the lives of our people either.” Russia’s defense ministry said Friday it intercepted and destroyed 75 “aircraft-type” drones, including 19 over Lipetsk, 26 over Belgorod, seven over Kursk, and several others over the regions of Bryansk, Voronezh, and Orel. It said it also destroyed five over Crimea and eight over the waters of the Black Sea.

Previous Ukrainian attacks on Russia have made some Western officials jittery, with some arguing that Kyiv should fight only a defensive war to avoid provoking a potential Russian escalation. Podolyak said Thursday that the West’s response had been “absolutely calm, balanced, objective, and based on an understanding of the spirit of international law and the principles of defensive warfare.” Unlike Zelensky, Podolyak directly referenced “events in the Kursk region.” “Now, a significant part of the global community considers [Russia] a legitimate target for any operations and types of weapons,” he added. The European Union foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stanno said Wednesday that Ukraine “has the legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller was slightly more tight-lipped, saying Ukraine has to decide its own tactics.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, the sisters have had to navigate the grim consequences of war as they trained for what should be the most exciting weeks of their sporting careers. In the buildup to the Games, the twins joined the Ukrainian synchronized swimming team in Kharkiv, a city near the Russian border which continues to be the target of attacks. “There were many bad instances in Kharkiv as there is constant shelling there,” Vladyslava tells CNN Sport . “Almost every day there is some explosion, both during the day and during the night.” “It always was very chilling as you see the rocket flying, but you don’t know where it will land.” The twins know what it takes to prepare for an Olympics. The duo won bronze at the Tokyo Games in 2020 and have continued to compete at the highest level, bringing joy to the sport through their relentless optimism. But their ability to remain hopeful has been tested in the buildup to Paris, with their training hampered by the daily threat of violence. “One day. we were on our way to training and there was an explosion near us. You are not able to think at that moment where to go, what to do,” Maryna tells CNN. “Your hands are shaking, you don’t understand what to do – so we turned back home.” Maryna and Vladyslava Aleksiiva are set to compete at the Paris Games. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images The twins say their training facility is near a tank factory which is often the target of Russian attacks. As a result, the pool itself has been damaged, with its windows blown out and replaced only with chipboard. There was even a time, they said, that broken glass lined the bottom of the pool. In addition to the war-torn facilities, training itself was frequently interrupted by air-raid sirens, with the twins having to jump out of the pool and head to a nearby bomb shelter in their wetsuits. “It really influenced our training in a bad way, both mentally and physically, the fact that we could not train like other countries in normal conditions,” Maryna admits. ‘A huge responsibility’ Despite the challenges facing the sisters, both are determined to represent their nation at the Olympic Games. Since the beginning of the invasion two years ago, Ukrainian athletes have been urged to act as global ambassadors for their country, flying the besieged nation’s flag at events around the world. Back at home, about 3,000 athletes – from Olympic and non-Olympic sports – have served for the country’s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life, according to Ukraine’s Sports Ministry earlier this year. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. “This is a huge responsibility for all our athletes right now. In these Olympics, we are not only athletes, we also represent Ukraine,” Maryna says. “It is an important mission to represent Ukraine appropriately.” The twins see it as their mission to represent Ukraine on the global stage. Al Bello/Getty Images Although Russia is banned from competing at the Olympic Games, some of its athletes are able to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs). These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements and no reference to the country will be made at the Games through the athletes’ participation. Like many Ukrainians, the twins are disappointed by the International Olympic Committee’s decision to permit Russian athletes. “We don’t see them as persons, they are not humane. They support this war, they kill our athletes, children, people. They destroy our homes,” Maryna adds. Vladislava adds: “Of course, when we see them at the Olympics, we won’t be able to do anything about it and we don’t want to say anything to them at all.” Ukraine has already won XX at this year’s Olympics, and the Aleksiivas are determined to add to the tally when they take to the pool in Paris."

Ukrainian forces are comprised of a mix of Ukrainian regular and special operations units, unlike previous Ukrainian operations inside Russia that often involved undercover units and local sympathizers. The intention, say US and Ukrainian officials, is multifaceted, in part to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces and in part to divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front. US officials do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long-term. Russia claimed on Thursday to have halted a Ukrainian incursion into its territory, but later said that some battles are ongoing in the Kursk region. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, units of the “North” group of its forces, together with the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, “continue to destroy Ukrainian armed forces formations in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, which are directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border.” CNN cannot independently verify these claims. Kursk residents, who live in the Sudzhansky District, recorded a video address to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday asking for his help, saying he has been misinformed about the situation on the ground and the Russian Defense Ministry’s statements about things being under control are untrue. The address was published on a local Telegram channel that is dedicated to covering the latest news out of the town of Sudzha in Kursk region, which has been under Ukrainian attack for several days. “These lies enable the local residents to die. The Chief of the General staff recently told you that the situation is under control, but today huge furious battles are underway in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts,” one of the residents said. “Sudzha was attacked, turned into ruins in a matter of hours. Local administration wasn’t working,” another resident said. The Russian Ministry of Health says 66 people, including nine children, were injured in Ukrainian shelling of the Kursk region since Tuesday. Medicine, blood and its components are available in medical organizations in the required volume, the ministry said. A mobile hospital with 100 beds to provide care to the wounded has been deployed by the Federal Medical and Biological Agency in the Kursk region since Wednesday, Russian state media TASS reported on Thursday citing agency’s press service. This handout photo from Russian authorities shows a damaged house in the town of Sudzha in Russia. Alexei Smirnov/Telegram/Reuters ‘Surrounded by ruins’ People in the region have complained that there was no organized evacuation, that the Ukrainian incursion caught them by surprise, and that they left their homes without belongings and documents in the middle of the night. They cannot contact relatives left behind, they said, because the mobile network is not working in the area. “We escaped under shelling. We were running surrounded by ruins,” one resident said. “We are left alone with children without a place to go, without a compensation, without any money. We escaped with only clothes on our backs,” one woman said bursting into tears. According to the phone calls received from the residents of the Malaya Loknya village in the Kursk region, almost 90% of the village is under the control of the Ukrainian armed forces at the moment, another resident said. Ukraine has not officially confirmed its forces conducted a ground operation inside Russia. Neither the Ukrainian military nor the government in Kyiv has publicly commented on the operation. “Hochu Nayti,” a Ukrainian state project created to provide information about the Russian prisoners of war, missing and dead military personnel in Ukraine, however claimed that “a lot of” Russian soldiers were captured in Russia’s Kursk region following the Ukrainian incursion. Russia accused Ukrainian troops of crossing the border into its Kursk region on Tuesday, claiming that Ukrainian forces launched a “massive attack” and attempted to break through the Russian defenses. The extent of the attack, including whether Ukrainian troops took over any settlements or caused damage to any strategic targets, remains unclear. CNN has geolocated video footage from inside a car that is being driven quickly through the deserted and damaged streets of the town of Sudzha, 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border. Some wrecked vehicles are also seen in the video as the car moves north out of the town. It’s unclear whether the video was shot Wednesday or Thursday. The Russian Defense Ministry said “attempts by individual [Ukrainian] units to break through deep into the territory in the Kursk direction are being thwarted.” It claimed that the Ukrainians had “lost up to 400 servicemen and 32 armoured vehicles, including a tank, four armoured personnel carriers, three infantry fighting vehicles and 24 Kozak armoured fighting vehicles.” The ministry’s claims cannot be verified. Russian military bloggers have described the situation as difficult, with communications jammed.  One prominent blogger was seriously injured Wednesday when his vehicle was struck. Mick Ryan, author of the Futura Doctrina blog and an analyst of the war in Ukraine, said Thursday that the Ukrainian military had deployed “quality formations. It appears that unlike in the 2023 southern counteroffensive where fresh brigades were employed, the Ukrainians have allocated experienced formations to this attack. This already appears to be paying dividends with the depth of the Ukrainian penetration so far.” The US-based conflict monitoring group the Institute for the Study of War said in its assessment on Thursday that “Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers” into the Kursk region on Wednesday. Kyiv remains silent on incursion claims Ukraine’s allies have not commented on the situation beyond saying the country has the right to defend itself. The EU’s foreign affairs and security policy spokesperson Peter Stano told the Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that according to the international law, Kyiv “has the legal right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory.” The White House was taken by surprise by the developments on Wednesday, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre telling reporters that it was not told ahead of time, adding that the Biden administration was “going to reach out to the Ukrainian military to learn more about their objectives.” Jean-Pierre said the US was “supportive of Ukraine as they are defending themselves against Russia’s aggression.” “And so, we’re going to continue to do that. And they are going to take actions … to certainly to protect themselves from these attacks,” she added. But as for the specific operation, we’re going to reach out to them to see what their objective is and continue to stay focused.  We are going to continue to stay focused on making sure they have what they need to defend themselves against Russia’s aggression. Ukrainian troops have found themselves under increased pressure along the 600-mile frontline as Moscow continues its slow, grinding offensive . Russian troops have recently made incremental advances towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, threatening a vital Ukrainian supply line. At the same time, Russian forces claim to have seized the village of Niu York and are getting closer to Toretsk. Kyiv has started receiving new tranches of the long-delayed US military assistance in May, but is still facing troop shortages because many of its newly recruited soldiers are still in training. The Ukraine Military Intelligence said on Thursday that its forces raided the Russian-occupied Tendra Spit on Tuesday, destroying Russian armoured vehicles, an electronic warfare system, and fortifications. The narrow island in the northern part of the Black Sea is about 40 miles long and about 1 mile wide. Ukrainian special forces destroyed Russian “equipment, personnel, and fortifications” during the raid, HUR said, adding that among the destroyed were armored vehicles, in particular MT-LB amphibious personnel carriers, electronic warfare complex and fortifications.

There were no losses among the Ukrainian forces, it said. An incursion into Russia could be an attempt by Kyiv to divert Russian resources elsewhere. Given the spate of more negative developments from the frontline, the news of a successful incursion help Kyiv boost the morale of its troops and civilian population. It could also be a message to Russia’s civilian population – a demonstration that Moscow’s war on Ukraine makes Russia vulnerable to attacks. A Russian military blogger Rybar reported on Wednesday that the Ukrainian military had established control over a gas transit station near the border. The blogger said the station is the only one through which gas from Russia flows to Ukraine and then to Europe. CNN cannot confirm that reporting. The European Union has imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Russia – with the exception of key natural gas imports. The EU was dependent on Russian gas and while it has slashed imports from Russia from 45% of all gas imports in 2021, to 15% of EU gas imports in 2023, some Russian gas still continues to flow to Europe through Ukraine, despite the war.

Ukraine’s decision to launch a large amount of its scant military resources across the border into Russia - in pursuit of headlines but, thus far, an unclear strategic objective – marks a moment of either desperation or inspiration for Ukraine. And it does perhaps herald a new phase of the war. Not because incursions into Russia by Ukraine are somehow new – they have been happening for over a year, mostly by Russian citizens, fighting for Ukraine with obvious Ukrainian military assistance but no official, public role. It feels new because this is, according to Russia at least, the regular Ukrainian army mounting an attack on Russia, and a rare roll of the dice by a Ukrainian top brass whose movements have been criticized mostly in the last 18 months as being too slow and conservative. On Tuesday, Kyiv took badly needed resources and fresh troops and launched them well inside Russia. The immediate effect satisfied two needs: a headline that involved Russian embarrassment and Ukrainian forward motion, and another that Moscow’s troops should scatter to reinforce their borders. After weeks of bad news for Kyiv, in which Russian forces have slowly but inexorably moved towards the Ukrainian military hubs of Pokrovsk and Sloviansk, Moscow is left scrambling to shore up its most essential front line – its own border. Obtained by Reuters video Related video Video shows fighter jets flying over road during attack on Russian border town But even as Kyiv declined to say anything Wednesday about what Russian President Vladimir Putin had called a “major provocation,” the wisdom of this gamble was openly questioned by some Ukrainian observers. There may be a larger strategy at play here. Sudzha, now at least partially under Ukrainian control, is next to a Russian gas terminal, right on the border, which is key to supplying gas from Russia, via Ukraine, to Europe. That arrangement is said to close end in January, and this may be a bid to curtail a lucrative source of funding for Moscow that has angered Kyiv since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022. (As of Thursday, there were no public indications of gas supplies being affected). Yet until the wider importance of this incursion emerges, there remains a huge question mark over the strategic goals of Oleksandr Syrskyi, the comparatively new commander of Ukraine’s forces. Splits in his command have simmered into public view recently, with younger subordinates questioning Syrskyi’s willingness to endure significant casualties in frontline battles of attrition, in which Russia’s superior manpower usually prevails. It is a Soviet mindset, and Syrskyi is from that era. But those dying or returning home as amputees are often from a younger generation who value dexterity and guile perhaps more than brute persistence.

Yuriy Mate/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images Ukraine has for months exceled at targeting – often with what appears to be Western help – Russia’s internal infrastructure , chewing up runways, naval bases, and oil terminals in a bid to cause long-term damage to Moscow’s economy and war machine. But this is different: It is sending a large ground force miles into enemy territory, where Ukrainian supply lines are more fraught and objectives are by definition tougher to pursue. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has long demanded the F-16s to aid his country's fight agains Russia. Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images Related article Ukraine confirms F-16s have arrived in country as Zelensky heralds ‘new chapter’ in fight against Russia The move comes at a time when the Ukrainian effort has begun to see a concrete benefit from Western weapons finally arriving. F-16 fighter jets are new to the front lines but may be able to dent Russia’s withering air supremacy in the coming months. That could mean fewer gliding bombs hitting Ukrainian frontline troops and fewer missiles terrorizing Ukraine’s urban communities. Ammunition remains a problem for Kyiv, according to some accounts, but surely Western supplies may eventually plug that gap. So why this high-risk move now? If we look beyond the immediate positive news cycle for President Volodymyr Zelensky, other goals emerge. For the first time in the war, talk of talks has begun. Russia may be invited to attend the next peace conference held by Ukraine and its allies. The proportion of Ukrainians who approve of negotiations, while a minority, is marginally growing. And the possibility of a Trump presidency is glowering above Kyiv. US Vice President Kamala Harris may retain the same steadfastness as President Joe Biden over Ukraine. But it is important to remember that Western foreign policy is a fickle and easily exhausted beast. NATO’s persistent backing for Ukraine is an outlier. And as the war edges towards its fourth year, questions about how this ends will grow louder. Ukrainian F-16 fighting aircrafts are seen in the air during marking the Day of the Ukrainian Air Forces, in an undisclosed location, Ukraine, August 4, 2024. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Is there any real merit to Ukraine fighting and dying with no real prospect of retaking occupied territory from Moscow? Does Russia want an indefinite grind forward, in which it loses thousands of men for hundreds of yards’ advance, and sees its wider military capability slowly worn down by longer-range Ukrainian strikes? With the prospect of a negotiated settlement now less distant, both sides will scramble to improve their battlefield position before sitting down at the table. It is unclear if Ukraine’s move into Kursk is motivated by that, or a simple move to inflict damage where the enemy is weak. But it marks a rare and substantial gamble with Kyiv’s limited resources, and so may herald the Ukrainians’ belief that greater change is ahead."

Russian President Vladimir Putin called the alleged incursion a “large-scale provocation,” saying Kyiv conducted “indiscriminate shooting from various types of weapons, including missiles, at civilian buildings, residential buildings, and ambulances.” Ukrainian authorities did not comment on the claims and CNN cannot independently verify them. The extent of the attack, including whether Ukrainian troops took over any settlements or caused damage to any strategic targets, remains unclear.

The Russian Ministry of Health says that 31 people, including six children, were injured as a result of Ukrainian shelling in the Kursk region. The mayor of the town, Vitaly Slashchev, described a “very tense” atmosphere, telling Russian state news agency RIA Novosti: “There is no time to talk, many people are calling about evacuation.” The available geolocated videos do not indicate that Ukrainian troops have entered the town. Slashchev had earlier told state news outlet RT that the town was not under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Border guards were “putting up serious resistance to the advancing enemy troops,” according to one unofficial Russian Telegram channel, Dya Mayora. “Unfortunately, enemy reconnaissance groups are penetrating further,” the post added. CNN is unable to confirm the account, but geolocated video shows that parts of Sudzha have been heavily shelled. Drone footage geolocated by CNN shows some 20 men who appear to have surrendered at the heavily damaged border crossing south-west of Sudzha. CNN is unable to confirm the identity of those shown in the video. Sternenko, an unofficial Ukrainian social media channel that distributed the video, said it showed at least 22 Russian soldiers “surrender” in the Kursk region. The acting governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Aleksey Smirnov, says he has “decided to introduce an emergency situation in the Kursk region from August 7th.” He added in a Telegram post that the “operational situation in the border areas remains difficult. To eliminate the consequences of the entry of enemy forces into the territory of the region, I decided to introduce an emergency situation.” It came after the Russian Ministry of Defense said that about 300 troops, supported by tanks and armored vehicles, attacked Russian positions near the villages of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya. Initially, the ministry said the attack was repelled, but that statement was later corrected to say that “the enemy is being inflicted with fire damage.” Later on Wednesday, state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov as telling Putin that “the advance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces deep into Russian territory has been stopped.” Aleksey Smirnov, the acting head of Kursk region, said Wednesday that several thousand people left the area over the past 24 hours. On Wednesday, the Russian National Guard said it has strengthened security measures at a nuclear power plant in the region. Rosgvardia said in a Telegram post that “within the framework of ensuring security of a particularly important guarded facility, Rosgvardia units took additional measures to protect the Kursk nuclear power plant.” The plant is about 50 kilometers north of where clashes and shelling are taking place around the town of Sudzha. It is unclear why Ukrainian forces would launch an attack of the scale described by Russian authorities. Ukrainian troops have found themselves under increased pressure along the 600-mile frontline as Moscow continues its slow, grinding offensive , so it could be an attempt to divert Russian resources elsewhere. Given the spate of more negative developments from the frontline, the news of a successful incursion help Kyiv boost the morale of its troops and civilian population. A Russian military blogger Rybar reported that the Ukrainian military had established control over a gas transit station near the border. The blogger said the station is the only one through which gas from Russia flows to Ukraine and then to Europe. CNN cannot confirm that reporting. The European Union has imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Russia – with the exception of key natural gas imports. The EU was dependent on Russian gas and while it has slashed imports from Russia from 45% of all gas imports in 2021, to 15% of EU gas imports in 2023, some Russian gas still continues to flow to Europe through Ukraine, despite the war. If confirmed, the attack would be a major development in the conflict – even if its immediate impact is limited. While there have been reports of pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups crossing into Russia, none have caused significant damage. The Ukrainian military has regularly attacked targets inside Russia with drones and missiles, but Kyiv has not launched any official ground incursions across the border in the two and half years since the start of the full-scale war. The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitoring group, said it had geolocated footage published on August 6 that shows damaged and abandoned armored vehicles roughly 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) north of the border, but said it could not confirm if they were Russian, Ukrainian or both. Russian forces have meanwhile been inching toward the strategically important city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, threatening a vital Ukrainian supply line. At the same time, Russian forces claim to have seized the village of Niu York and are getting closer to Toretsk.

She doesn’t intervene with anything about the war.” “I believe America will bring her back to me,” Van Heerden said. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused Karelina of taking part in “public actions to support the Kyiv regime.” The organization to which Karelina reportedly gave money, the New York-based non-profit Razom for Ukraine, said it was “appalled” by her detention.

Nearly two-and-a-half years later, the war grinds on with Ukrainians fighting a battle for survival and trying to push Russian forces out of their country. After missing out on a medal at the last Games in Tokyo in 2021, the world of Ukrainian fencer Olga Kharlan – and that of her countrymen and women – was turned upside down. “When I didn’t succeed in Tokyo, I thought it’s the worst time in my life and then, when the war started, I said nothing compares to what’s happening to all your country,” the 33-year-old told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies. “When you see any Ukrainian abroad or come back home, you speak only about 24 th of February [and] how you spent first day of the war. “This is our story right now. We try to live with that. We try to build the future. This is the way to say to each other that we deserve to live, we deserve to exist. “Nobody can take our home. We will fight to try that to the end and all the world will support us.” A moment of joy Kharlan, competing at her fifth Olympic Games, is making up for lost time in Paris. Days after the opening ceremony, she claimed a dramatic individual bronze medal, rallying from a six-point deficit to beat South Korea’s Choi Se-bin and hand her country its first medal at the 2024 Games. It served as a tonic for her to put on a brilliant performance and lead Ukraine to a stunning comeback win against South Korea for the country’s first gold in Paris.

Ezra Shaw/Getty Images The victory was not only the second gold in the event for Ukraine after they won the title in 2008 but ensured the sabre fencer became Ukraine’s most successful Olympian ever with six medals. Following the stunning triumph, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the Ukrainian team. “I thank them for the result, for the spirit, for showing that Ukrainians win!” he wrote on his X , formerly known as Twitter, account. “Ukraine knows how to inspire both at the Olympic Games and times like these!” It’s a message that’s left a powerful impression on Kharlan. “This is history for my country. This is history for all the world and shows to all the world that we can do it. Ukraine can do it. And sport, it’s one of the ways to say that Ukraine can fight and to say to all the world that Ukraine has to win,” she says, grasping her medals. “During this moment, you see how the whole country is united and they’re celebrating even through this very difficult moment [with] air sirens, bombing, troops on the frontline. “They are watching and they’re also celebrating, and this is a moment of joy. “Right now, it’s [like] some movie with a happy ending, but when your country is under bombing every day, it’s not a happy end completely.” Kharlan celebrates her women's sabre team gold on the podium. Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images It’s a brief moment of joy not just felt at home but also in person with her family who’ve made it to the French capital from their residence in the besieged city of Mykolaiv. While Kharlan’s mother Iryna, 61, sister Tetiana, 40, and 3-and-a-half-year old nephew Tymophii traveled from the southern Ukrainian city, her father Hennadiy, who was a professional athlete in sailing, remains at home. “My sister, when she comes, I win. I won like two world championships with her, so I said [to her], ‘Let’s take you to Paris!’” she says smiling. “[My father]’s not really a talker, let’s say, but I know what he’s thinking. He’s so proud of me and I’m so happy to make him proud. “I made my grandmother proud who – on August 15 – will be 81. I know that my grandpa and grandma, they’re looking [down on me] and they would be very proud to see it. Unfortunately, they’re not with us anymore. I dedicate it to them. In my heart, in my mind, they’re always there.” ‘I wouldn’t change anything’ Kharlan, though, very nearly wasn’t in Paris. While competing at the World Championships in Italy last year, the leader of Ukraine’s national fencing team refused to shake hands with her defeated Russian rival, Anna Smirnova. Smirnova walked away before staging a sit-down protest for about 45 minutes. The symbolic move, made as Kharlan’s country was fighting back against Russia’s invasion, was risky for the four-time individual world champion’s chances of racking up enough points to qualify for the Games. Kharlan was initially disqualified, but the following day was readmitted to the tournament and given an automatic place at next year’s Paris Olympics by the International Olympic Committee who said the decision was “in keeping with the Olympic Spirit.” Kharlan refusing to greet Anna Smirnova of Russia, registered as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN), during the 2023 FIE Fencing World Championship Women's Sabre 1st round match in Milan, Italy. Tadashi Miyamoto/AFLO/Shutterstock Does she still stand by her decision? “I realized that it can be risky, but to think about this right now, I wouldn’t change anything. I would do the same no matter what decision would be. It won’t change for a long time,” she explains. “It was a lot of, injustice – Ukraine at war. My parents in Ukraine, Mykolaiv under bombing. I can’t go to Olympics anymore. … But on the next day, everything just changed completely because of Ukrainian people, because of Ukrainian media, all the world media. “When I had this all support from Ukraine, this is like this huge hug from Ukrainian people … It’s more than sports. “I don’t want to boycott competitions. I want to go to fight, but I won’t shake hands because there’s no respect. Even though they’re neutral, we all know that they are not neutral.” Pointing to her medals she adds: “This is proof that Ukraine deserves to be in the Olympics, and this is the way how it’s supposed to be.” Always in our memory Ukraine is fielding its smallest ever team at a Games consisting of 140 athletes. While Khalan and her teammates have had the opportunity to travel and compete in the French capital, thoughts of those who haven’t been able to make the journey have remained at the forefront of their minds during the competition. Gold medalists Olena Kravatska, Alina Komashchuk, Kharla and Yuliia Bakastova celebrate on the podium on August 3. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images According to Ukraine’s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes – from Olympic and non-Olympic sports – have served for the country’s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. “It was my first words when I won the bronze and it was the first words when, we won the gold. Everything that we are doing and that we have done during these two years, it was for them,” she says. “We have also fencers who were killed by Russia, who went to the frontline. I still have friends who are fighting for our future and our lives. “It’s our need to fight for them because they couldn’t. … They will never do it again and they will always be in our memory.”"

After the attack, JNIM claimed that a “complex ambush” had wiped out the convoy, killing 50 Russians and several Malian soldiers, and published videos showing several vehicles ablaze as well as dozens of bodies in the area. A Tuareg militant group spokesman said some Malian troops and Russian fighters had also been captured during the battle. According to some unofficial Russian Telegram channels, as many as 80 Russians were killed.

Journalist Artem Khudolieiev was another Ukrainian who felt passionately that Russian and Belarusian athletes shouldn’t be allowed to compete at the Paris Olympics for having openly supported the war in Ukraine. As a result, he started checking the social media output of Russian and Belarusian athletes as well as watching videos of various events held in the two countries. Then he shared what he had discovered with various sporting and government bodies. “From the very beginning, I had an understanding of why I was doing this,” Khudolieiev told CNN. Artem Khudolieiev sent dozens of emails to prevent athletes who supported Russia's war against Ukraine from participating in the 2024 Olympics. Svitlana Vlasova/CNN “I believe that everyone who can do something should do it. Evil must be punished. And if there are any opportunities to punish it, then it should be done.” Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian and Belarusian athletes were suspended from almost all elite sporting competitions . “Knowing how the International Olympic Committee (IOC) works, what lobbying opportunities officials have in various federations, I understood that they [athletes] would be returned closer to the Olympics,” said Khudolieiev. “And the fact that many of the athletes support the war, go to rallies in support of the war – this could be one of the factors that could prevent this return. So it’s necessary to collect such facts,” added the journalist as he reflects on his work.

He estimated there were as many as 600 such athletes, based on his internet sleuthing. “I collected posts in support of the war, if they were on Instagram. In particular, there were photos of athletes with the Russian military, who had already taken part in the invasion, likes of posts with the letter Z, likes of posts of the military,” said Khudolieiev, referring to the symbol associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At first, Khudolieiev said he acted independently, collecting evidence and sending it to sports and government organizations. Khudolieiev, who works as a publishing editor for the Watchers Media website, then enlisted the support of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Ukraine and the Ministry of Sport, which had also been actively lobbying for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes who supported the war from the Olympics. Six months before the Olympics was due to start, the ministry and the NOC began attaching all the evidence that Khudolieiev had provided to their official appeals, posting these letters on their website. “We understand that … many countries don’t care what happens in Ukraine. There are those who also sympathize with Russian athletes,” Vadym Gutzeit, head of the Ukrainian National Olympic Committee, said in an interview with CNN. “For us, this is completely incomprehensible because, during the war, unfortunately, not a single athlete from Russia or Belarus spoke out against the war,” added Guzeit. “Not a single athlete condemned this war. It is not clear to us at all when we see athletes at sports competitions or events where they support this war against Ukraine, they support the killing that is taking place in Ukraine.” Taking on Russian Olympians “ Friends, let’s unite together and support the mobilized guys who are now defending our homeland ,” Vladislav Larin – a Russian taekwondo gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics – said on social media in the spring of 2023 when the war in Ukraine was in full swing. Larin posted the video on his social media account, where it was seen by Khudolieiev. In addition to Larin’s call, the subtitles of the short video said that collected donations would be spent, among other things, on medicines and ammunition for the mobilized Russian military. These five seconds could be key to explaining why the athlete was suspended from the World Championships and why he did not qualify for the 2024 Olympics. Khudolieiev also found evidence on social media of support for the war by another Russian Olympic taekwondo champion , Maxim Khramtsov. “In October 2022, Khramtsov posted on his Vkontakte page congratulating Putin on his 70th birthday, saying that he loves him and that all Russian athletes love and support him. He also added a hashtag with the letter Z, for peace,” said Khudolieiev, referring to the letter widely adopted in Russia as a pro-war symbol. The journalist saved the videos of the athletes and, in the belief that they showed Khramtsov and Larin’s support for the war in Ukraine, Khudolieiev said he sent this information – in more than 30 emails – to officials of World Taekwondo and some national federations of taekwondo. The participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes has been one of the major talking points leading up to this year's Olympic Games.

Individual Neutral Athletes explained A few weeks later, it emerged that both athletes had been suspended from the championships. Although no official reasons for this decision were made public and Khudolieiev said he did not receive any feedback on the numerous emails he sent, the journalist told CNN that he felt his work was having an impact. “I’m more than sure that the reason was my very facts because there was no other evidence,” said Khudolieiev. “And out of the entire team, it was the two athletes I reported about who were suspended from the competition, while the rest of the Russians and Belarusians were allowed to participate. “I thought it was a victory, that they had no chance of making it to the Olympics because they had already admitted that they supported the war.” However, according to Khudolieiev, World Taekwondo then allowed Larin and Khramtsov to return to competition. Larin and Khramtsov continued to compete and eventually received their licences to participate in the 2024 Olympics, but were then suspended from the competition on June 15 after one of the stages of the IOC’s special commission’s review. Both athletes deleted their posts from social media, while Larin and his wife blocked Khudolieiev’s profile from being viewed by him, according to the journalist. Aftermath of a Russian missile strike on the office building of the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action (FSD), Kharkiv, north-central Ukraine. Viacheslav Madiievskyi/Ukrinform/Future Publishing/Getty Images/File They did not publicly admit that the reason for their suspension from the competition was their support for the war. “We cannot comment on individual cases and the decisions of the Review Panel,” the IOC told CNN. “It has reviewed the athletes in accordance with the IOC EB decision and the principles that were established. We have nothing further to add.” The Russian Olympic Federation did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding Larin and Khramtsov. Taekwondo World also did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. “After all these facts were made public, Russian titled athletes no longer raise money for the Russian army, as was the case with Larin,” said Khudolieiev. “They are being careful on social media, no one likes anything in support of the war. “Posts have disappeared entirely, and they even delete old posts. They already understand that this could have an impact on their careers. “It is important that the world knows that they have been suspended for supporting the war,” added Khudolieiev. “In Russia, sport is not outside of politics, but is one of the industries that is used to support the war, to popularize it among young people.” The ongoing struggle For this year’s Paris Olympics, the International Olympic Committee set strict eligibility conditions for Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in December 2023. In March 2024, a special commission was set up to assess the eligibility of each athlete with a Russian or Belarusian passport to participate in the Olympic Games. In July, human rights foundation Global Rights Compliance (GRC) released a report stating that over two thirds of Russian athletes set to participate at the Olympics have violated the IOC’s “Principles of Participation” regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes has been one of the major talking points leading up to this year's Olympic Games. Illustration by Leah Abucayan/CNN/Getty Related article Can Russians and Belarusians compete at the Paris Olympics? Individual Neutral Athletes explained This includes evidence of “athletes supporting war on social media, participating in pro-war tournaments and being members of Russian military-linked institutions,” according to the GRC. The IOC did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the GRC report. Khudolieiev speculated that it is highly likely that the IOC Special Commission took his evidence into account when determining which athletes to include in the Olympics. “The whole process [of assessing neutrality] was very non-transparent, so it’s hard to say whether they did their own investigation,” said Khudolieiev. “There were three former athletes in this IOC commission, who, as far as I know, all do not speak Russian. “When the IOC representatives were asked about the work of this commission, they said that a lot of information was coming from Ukraine and they were checking it. “They also said that they themselves collect information about Russian military contracts on official Russian websites. As for the support of the war on social media, I don’t think any such work was done,” said Khudolieiev. The commission divided all neutral athletes into several groups and conducted the assessment in several waves. After each assessment, the number of neutral athletes was reduced. Earlier this year, Russian and Belarusian neutral athletes had around 70 licences to participate in the Olympics. According to the Ukrainian side, even among those admitted, there are Russian and Belarusian athletes whose neutrality is questionable, as there is clear evidence of their support for the war. According to the Ukrainian side, even among those admitted, there are Russian and Belarusian athletes whose neutrality is questionable, as there is clear evidence of their support for the war. In early July, Ukraine appealed to the IOC with evidence of 13 athletes’ support for the war. Ukraine expected that a special commission reviewed these materials and the number of neutral athletes would be further reduced. “I would like to note that the Russian Federation usually had more than 300 athletes at the Olympic Games,” Gutzeit told CNN. “It was one of the most powerful teams at the Olympics, and in terms of medals, too. “And today I think there are maybe 30 or 40 athletes who will be at the Olympic Games under a neutral flag, without any symbols, without the anthem, they are not allowed to go to the opening ceremony, they will not be in the overall medal ranking. “I think this is also a victory,” added Gutzeit. Ultimately, as of July 20, only 32 athletes accepted the invitation to compete under the AIN designation and traveled to Paris, according to Olympics.com. Khudolieiev said he did not expect such results when he set out to collect evidence of Russian and Belarusian athletes’ support for the war. “In taekwondo, we managed to get the entire {Russian] team, all four people, banned because I submitted information that they all participated in the World Military Games in November 2022,” said Khudolieiev. “There are photos of them in uniform. In wrestling, we managed to prevent all four Olympic champions from being admitted. In judo, we managed to suspend many. “In general, I think we managed to exclude about 30 people from participation with our facts. This also has positive consequences in that, for example, because the Russians were suspended or refused to participate in wrestling and judo, Ukraine received, I think, five additional licences. This is also, in a sense, a help to our athletes.” In June, Sergey Soloveichik, the president of the Russian Judo Federation, said that none of the four judokas who had qualified to compete in Paris would be participating due to the “humiliating terms” outlined by the IOC, according to Russian news agency TASS. “The Russian Judo Federation condemns the unsportsmanlike method of qualification, which is geared to undermine the principles of unity of our team and break the spirit of Russian athletes,” said Soloveichik. Khudolieiev said his next mission will be to focus on the 2026 Winter Olympics, where, in his opinion, there should be no place for Russian and Belarusian athletes who support the war in Ukraine. “What can Russia boast of in the world? They say they have a lot of nuclear weapons and a lot of Olympic medals. Now they will not have the second,” said Khudolieiev. “Well, maybe they will win one or two medals, but it will not be like it used to be.”"

The submarine Rostov-on-Don was hit in the port of Sevastopol on Friday, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said in a statement Saturday. “The boat sank on the spot,” the General Staff said, without providing further evidence. If confirmed, the sinking would be Ukraine’s latest blow to Russia’s navy, which Kyiv claims has already lost a third of its Black Sea Fleet. CNN is not able to independently verify the claim, and the Russian Defense Ministry has not commented on the alleged attack. The alleged loss of the Rostov-on-Don “proves once again that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,” the General Staff said. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry hailed the attack, saying in a post on social media that “a Russian submarine went to the bottom of the Black Sea” after it was attacked in Sevastopol’s port. “As a result of the attack, the submarine sank. Great work, warriors.” Russia has occupied Crimea since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago, it has come under sporadic attack from Kyiv’s forces.

Commissioned in 2014, the Rostov-on-Don is a 73.8-meter (242-foot) Kilo II-class submarine and carries a crew of 52. With a submerged displacement of 3,100 tons, the diesel-electric-powered vessel can carry Kalibr cruise missiles. Taking out Russian assets armed with Kalibr missiles is an important part of Kyiv’s military strategy because Russia has used Kalibr and missiles like it to attack vital Ukrainian infrastructure such as power plants, said Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst. “Hitting this submarine is a big, big deal,” Leighton said. Ukraine has targeted the Rostov-on-Don before. The submarine was “severely damaged” in a Ukrainian missile attack in September 2023, according to Ukraine’s General Staff. After that attack, open-source intelligence photos, including ones cited by Britain’s defense ministry, showed what the ministry said was “catastrophic damage.” But Ukraine’s General Staff said the Rostov-on-Don was repaired and recently tested in the waters of Sevastopol harbor.

More than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own, technological innovation , audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea. Russia’s worst naval loss of the war was the sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva in April 2022. In October last year, satellite imagery indicated that Russia relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks. In addition to striking the submarine, Ukrainian forces also severely damaged four S-400 anti-aircraft missile launchers on Friday, the Ukrainian General Staff said. Leighton said destruction of the anti-aircraft batteries could help open up the skies over Crimea for Ukrainian warplanes to take on more Russian targets on the occupied peninsula."

But the Russians can also count a win. This was not an episode ripped from a John le Carré-style thriller, with spies on both sides being exchanged across a bridge. Instead, the Kremlin collected human collateral – journalists and opposition figures, both Russian and foreign – to secure the release of Russians apparently serving the interests of the state. Among those headed back to Russia are convicted hackers and several Russian nationals detained in the West for spying. And the biggest prize for Russia was the return of Vadim Krasikov, a convicted hitman whose release had been publicly sought by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Krasikov was convicted by a German court of the 2019 killing of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, an ethnic Chechen of Georgian nationality, in a Berlin park. In a February interview with right-wing media personality Tucker Carlson, Putin cast the assassination of Khangoshvili as a public service, describing Krasikov as “a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit.” Krasikov was convicted by a German court of the 2019 killing of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili. Berlin Police The release of Krasikov and others accused of espionage appears to send a familiar message. If you work for us, you will ultimately be rewarded and protected. And if you betray us, our memories are long. Take the case of Viktor Bout, the Russian who was exchanged in 2022 for basketball star Brittney Griner. Described as “one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers” by the US Department of Justice – and the inspiration for the anti-hero of the Hollywood film Lord of War – Bout was long suspected of ties to Russian intelligence services. After his return to Russia, Bout found a place in politics, winning a seat in a regional legislature. He had flattering interviews in the press and appeared at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, the favorite annual talking-shop for Putin and the Russian elite. Anna Chapman, one of 10 Russian sleeper agents deported from the US in a 2010 prisoner swap, was also feted on her return to Russia.  She was elected to a pro-government board. She also launched her own line of clothing. Chapman and nine other so-called “illegals” were traded for four people, including former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, who had been convicted of spying for the United Kingdom. Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok in the English cathedral city of Salisbury in 2018. Britain blamed the poisoning on Russia; Russia has consistently denied involvement, although Putin referred to Skripal as a “scumbag” and a “traitor,” his contempt suggesting that Skripal had gotten his just desserts. Personnel in protective gear investigate the nerve-agent poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in Salisbury, England, in this 2018 file image. Frank Augstein/AP/File The long arm of the Kremlin also seemed apparent in the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko , a former Russian agent turned whistleblower. Both a 2016 British inquiry and the European Court of Human Rights concluded the two men who allegedly poisoned Litvinenko – former KGB and FSB employee Andrei Lugovoi and former Russian army officer Dmitri Kovtun – were acting on behalf of the Russian state. Lugovoi went on to win a seat in the Russian parliament. He won an “Order of Merit” medal from Putin in 2015. This pattern of history, then, reinforces a message to all who work the Russian state – and especially for its massive security and intelligence apparatus – that Russia looks after its own. Putin, after all, is a graduate of the intelligence services, and knows the code of honor that is peculiar to world of Russian espionage. But what does this complex deal tell us about Russia’s ongoing confrontation with the West? Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, relations between Moscow and Washington have been at an all-time low. But the negotiations that led to Thursday’s swap show that channels of communication between US and Russian officials remain open. We know, for instance, that a multi-country exchange of prisoners that might have freed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was being discussed when Navalny died in a Russian prison in February. Those discussions, CNN reported, involved Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich; former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also supported back-channel efforts to free Navalny. And even with the Ukraine war raging, top US and Russian generals have also kept crucial lines of communication open, in large part to keep the United States and Russia from veering inadvertently into open conflict. The exchange of Russian opposition figures, however, is also a sort of victory for the Kremlin. Even in prison, individuals such as Vladimir Kara-Murza – who was serving a lengthy sentence for treason – retained stature internationally as prisoners of conscience. Dissidents such as Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko, who was sentenced to seven years for a protest that involved putting anti-war messages on price tags in a Russian grocery store – have laid bare the absurdity of Russia’s draconian wartime media laws. The exchange, at least in the short term, means those anti-war voices are exiled, and not a threat to the system. The release of Russians in the swap means that Russia’s political climate is no less repressive. And in geopolitical terms, little changes. Following the prisoner exchange, the West will still have to confront a Russian leadership that has made clear what its priorities are: protecting the interests of the security state and maintaining a path of open hostility toward the West."

It marks the largest attack on the capital so far this year, and the seventh time Russia has targeted Kyiv this month, military officials said on Wednesday. The “massive” attack lasted more than seven hours and the drones came in two waves, Kyiv officials said, adding that “not a single drone reached its target.” There were no hits to residential or critical infrastructure and no casualties in the Kyiv region, according to regional military head Ruslan Kravchenko. However, 13 houses were damaged and rescuers extinguished one fire caused by the downed drones. “The majority of the UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] debris fell outside of the settlements,” he added. Dramatic video released by the Ukrainian Air Force shows one drone on fire, falling from the sky and landing in a field — causing a large cloud of smoke but no visible damage. Russia also attacked the country’s Mykolaiv region with an X-59 guided missile from the airspace of the occupied Kherson region, which Ukraine said it also shot down. However, separate attacks on eastern and southern Ukraine killed at least two people Wednesday morning. The Kremlin did not comment on the attacks in its regular briefing with reporters on Wednesday. Repeated calls for more air defense systems Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk called the drone barrage targeting Kyiv “one of the most massive attacks by Shahed-131/136” drones, comparing it to the Russian attack on New Year’s Eve in which 90 Shaheds were launched. “Just like then, today the Ukrainian air defense has withstood and repelled a massive attack by enemy drones,” he said. “Mobile fire groups of all the Ukrainian Defence Forces, tactical aviation of the Air Force and Army Aviation of the Land Forces, anti-aircraft missile units and electronic warfare units of the Air Force were involved in repelling the air attack.” During another wave of aerial attacks days before the New Year’s Eve holiday, Russia fired an unprecedented number of drones and missiles at targets across Ukraine, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 150 others, according to Ukrainian officials at the time. Since then, Ukraine has repeatedly pleaded for allies to provide more air defense systems. “Ukrainians can fully protect their skies from Russian strikes when they have sufficient supplies,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday. “The same level of defense is needed against Russian missiles and the occupier’s combat aircraft. And this can be achieved. We need sufficiently courageous decisions from our partners — enough air defense systems, enough range,” Zelensky added. “And Ukrainians will do everything correctly and precisely.” The Biden administration announced on Monday a new lethal aid package for Ukraine totaling about $1.7 billion and largely consisting of missiles and ammunition for missile, artillery and air defense systems that the US has previously provided to Ukraine. Deaths in eastern and southern Ukraine In southern Ukraine, a 68-year-old man in Kherson was killed in a drone strike on Wednesday morning, according to the region’s military head. A 73-year-old woman was also injured in that attack, and elsewhere in the region three people were injured in Russian shelling, the official said. In the Donetsk region, one resident in the city of Toretsk was killed, and four others were injured in attacks elsewhere. Ukraine’s Armed Forces said it will “continue to effectively hit important military targets of the Russian occupiers,” claiming that on Tuesday night Ukraine carried out a strike on a weapons and military equipment storage facility near the city of Kursk, Russia. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region said a fire broke out at a facility there “after an attack by the Ukrainian armed forces.” CNN’s Michael Conte contributed to this report."

Russia has been stretching Ukrainian defenses across the entire eastern front line for months, trying to capture as much territory as possible before new Ukrainian recruits and fresh batches of Western weapons start arriving on the battlefield. The gains made by Russia have been largely incremental – the front line has barely moved in the past few months – but the recent advance toward Pokrovsk has Ukraine and its allies worried. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the difficult situation in his nightly address to the nation on Sunday, saying Ukrainian troops were facing “extremely challenging” realities in that area.

Analysts at the United States-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Tuesday that Russian troops have recently made “significant tactical advances” in the area, which sits just northwest of Avdiivka, the previously fiercely contested town that Ukrainian troops withdrew from in February. Russian forces were about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Pokrovsk on Tuesday, according to the ISW, continuing what it called “intensive efforts to advance and conduct a limited tactical encirclement of Ukrainian forces in the Pokrovsk direction.” Pokrovsk is not a major city – about 60,000 people lived there before the war and many have left since the start of the full-scale invasion. But it serves as a key hub for the Ukrainian military, thanks to its easy access to Kostiantynivka, another military center. The road connecting the two is used by the Ukrainians to resupply troops on the frontlines and evacuate casualties toward Dnipro. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear that his goal is to seize all of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. Kostiantynivka is the southernmost part of a belt of four Ukrainian cities – with Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – that form the backbone of Ukraine’s defenses of the region, which is why any progress of Russian troops toward Kostiantynivka is worrying. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces captured the Ukrainian villages of Lozuvatske over the weekend and Vovche on Monday. Both of them are about 15 kilometers (nine miles) from the road between Kostiantynivka and Pokrovsk. Kyiv said its troops are fighting hard to push Russian troops back – adding Tuesday that the Ukrainian Armed Forces prevented 52 attacks in the direction of Pokrovsk in the past 24 hours. It is unlikely the pressure will ease any time soon. Residents wait before being evacuated to a shelter in Pokrovsk. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images Ukraine finally started to receive new batches of US weapons in May, following months of delays, and it has recruited thousands of new soldiers that are currently in training and are expected to start arriving at the front lines in the fall. The combination of the two should give Ukraine a much-needed boost and Russia’s strategy appears to be to slow this down as much as possible. By pushing ahead and making these gradual, seemingly incremental advances along the more than 600-mile-long (1,000-kilometer) front line, Russia is forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive.

Orban, whose own government has passed a number of anti-LGBT measures , said Russia had gained clout in many parts of the world by cracking down on LGBTQ+ rights. “The strongest international appeal of Russian soft power is its opposition to LGBTQ,” he said. He added that Ukraine would never become a member of the EU or NATO because “we Europeans do not have enough money for that”. “The EU needs to give up its identity as a political project and become an economic and defence project,” Orban added. The EU opened membership talks with Ukraine late last month, although a long and tough road lies ahead of the country before it can join the bloc.

Around 50 brands are scheduled to show via a variety of mediums, from traditional runway shows to installations, presentations and performances. Most events will take place at the Mystetskyi Arsenal — Ukraine’s National Art and Culture Museum Complex — while a parade of designers and models will walk through the city in “a symbolic demonstration of unity,” according to a press release. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of neighboring country Ukraine almost three years ago, more than 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died . With Russian forces suffering even bigger losses (earlier this month, the UK Defense Ministry said more than 70,000 soldiers were likely killed or wounded in May and June 2024 alone), authorities in Moscow are offering record signing-on bonuses of around $22,000 to attract new recruits to fight in the conflict. “We still have war in the whole country, and we feel the war in the whole country,” Lisa Ushcheka, head of international communications for Ukrainian Fashion Week, told CNN in a video call. “Because of the missile attacks, the blackouts and power outages. There are regions that (have) extremely hard shelling, regions that are suffering. We are used to it, and we have to live in this war reality. It is our new reality.” Protective measures will be in place for all eventualities. The Mystetskyi Arsenal, for example, where most shows will take place, is equipped with bomb shelters. “Once we hear the air raid siren, all guests will be asked to proceed to the bomb shelter,” Ushcheka said.

Organizers have been discussing the possibility of returning to Kyiv for the last six months, said Ushcheka, who hopes the conflict doesn’t escalate. “If the war intensifies,” she told CNN, “and something unexpected happens, because each day the situation changes, of course in the worst case scenario we can cancel.” Ivan Frolov, a Kyiv-born fashion designer scheduled to exhibit in September’s showcase, added that the Ukrainian spirit has become evermore adaptable in the face of adversity. “Since the war started, we don’t only have a plan B, but a plan C, G, even Z.” Yevhen Samuchenko Related article A Ukrainian photographer’s love letter to his homeland “But life doesn’t stop,” said Ushcheka.

In February 2023, Frolov presented his Fall-Winter 2023 collection in a group show alongside labels Ksenia Schnaider and Paskal in London. “We were so appreciative of that possibility,” he said over Zoom. “For me, that show was not just about reaching a hand out and saying, ‘Please help us. We need your help.’ That was about us saying ‘We are very strong. We are very talented. We are the same as you. We are here.’” Each participating brand has agreed to make a donation in support of a new palliative care unit in the city, monies that will be used to buy specific medical equipment to help those with severe and incurable injuries. Guests will also have the opportunity to donate throughout the event. “We hope that it will be inspirational for the whole world,” said Ushcheka. “Because it’s a historical event, a fashion week taking place in a country where there is a war going on.” For Frolov, the prospect of staging a return show in Kyiv is emotionally overwhelming. “I’m happy my sunglasses are black,” he said, from behind a pair of dark glasses. “Because my eyes are wet right now. I love Kyiv very much. I was born in Kyiv and Kyiv is everything to me. With the support of the Minister of Culture and the Minister of Economy I’m able to travel and visit other countries, but I can’t leave the country for more than one month, because I feel sick without Kyiv. I feel empty without Kyiv. It’s my motherland, it’s my soul.” “This September, I want to reinstall Kyiv as one of the main cities of fashion in the world.”"

Hong Kong CNN — Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Hong Kong to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions during a visit to the city on Thursday. The United States and European Union have sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, including the supply of critical dual‑use goods such as semiconductors. Kuleba “called on the Hong Kong administration to take measures to prevent Russia and Russian companies from using Hong Kong to circumvent the restrictive measures imposed for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued after the minister met with Hong Kong leader John Lee. “These restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia’s capacity to wage war and kill people in Ukraine,” it added. “The Minister stressed that Russia’s machinations should not spoil Hong Kong’s reputation as a highly developed liberal economy based on unwavering respect for the rule of law.” Dual-use items are goods, software or technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications. The US has said that some of the dual-use items targeted by its sanctions are critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government told CNN on Friday that it “implements and strictly enforces” United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions. While the UN General Assembly has passed resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine, similar resolutions at the UNSC have been vetoed by Russia, a permanent member of the group.

However, international companies based in Hong Kong, including Chinese banks, have generally adhered to US sanctions to avoid any risk of being frozen out of the dollar dominated global financial system. Kuleba’s visit to Hong Kong was the final leg of his trip to China, the first time the close partner of Russia has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago. Beijing, which has forged deeper ties with Russia since the invasion and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for Moscow, has repeatedly decried “unilateral sanctions” and what it calls “long-arm jurisdiction” by Western countries, saying they have no basis in international law. In a meeting in the southern city of Guangzhou on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that, “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.” Kuleba told Wang that Ukraine was prepared for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but stressed that Kyiv saw no such willingness from Moscow. The Ukrainian diplomat’s visit comes as Beijing faces increasing pressure from the West over its deepening ties to Russia and allegations that it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense."

A former nationalist parliamentarian and professor, Farion was known for her unfavorable attitude towards the Russian language, which is spoken in eastern Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine launched a criminal investigation against the academic last year, after she published a social media post with a screenshot of a message from a pro-Ukrainian student in occupied Crimea, containing the name, surname and other personal data of the sender. That information became the basis for his persecution by the Russian special services. During the investigation in November, Farion told authorities that she categorically rejected Russian-speaking members of the Armed Forces fighting against Russia’s full-scale invasion, according to Reuters, saying she could not call them Ukrainians. Her statement triggered a wave of outrage among sections of Ukrainian society."

The financial sweetener comes as President Vladimir Putin struggles to recruit soldiers for his army as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on in its third year. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin introduced the one-time signing bonus of 1.9 million rubles (about $22,000) for city residents who join the military, according to a statement on Tuesday. Anyone taking up the offer would earn as much as 5.2 million rubles ($59,600) in their first year of service, the statement added. Those willing to join the fight in Ukraine can also receive one-time cash payments of about $5,690-$11,390 for injuries, “depending on the severity,” and the family of a soldier killed in action could be paid $34,150. While Russia’s casualty numbers remain shrouded in secrecy, estimates say the death toll among troops is high. More than 70,000 soldiers were likely killed or wounded in May and June alone, the UK defense ministry said in an update on July 12, as the Russian army faced high losses on a new front in the Kharkiv region. It is estimated that Russia has lost 87% of the active-duty ground troops it had prior to launching its invasion of Ukraine and two-thirds of its pre-invasion tanks, a source familiar with a declassified US intelligence assessment provided to Congress told CNN in December last year. Social media is filled with video footage taken by drones of Russian troops being killed or left with life-changing injuries in what soldiers grimly call “ meat grinder ” battles against Ukrainian defenders. Ukrainian soldiers have often spoken of how their outnumbered forced face so-called human wave assaults from an enemy whose commanders appear happy to tolerate brutal attrition rates. As personnel deaths mount, the Kremlin is looking all over the place to find fighters to send to the front. Putin has ordered the country’s military to increase troop numbers by 170,000, which would take the overall number of Russian military personnel to more than 2.2 million, including 1.32 million troops, according to a decree published by the Kremlin in December. That equates to boosting the Russian army’s size by 15% and marks the second such expansion of the army since Putin launched its invasion. Putin initially ordered an immediate “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens in September 2022 following a string of defeats that caused recriminations in Moscow. The mobilization meant citizens who were military reservists could be called up and that those with military experience were subject to conscription. The conscription campaign led to fierce demonstrations – particularly in Russia’s ethnic minority regions where mobilization efforts were concentrated – and has sparked an exodus of military-age men fleeing the country to avoid joining the war. Although the mobilization campaign was suspended in November 2022 after officials said the target of recruiting 300,000 personnel had been met, Russia has been recruiting fighters beyond its borders to fight in Ukraine. Russia has recruited as many as 15,000 Nepalis to fight its war in Ukraine, with many of them left traumatized, while an unknown number remain missing or possibly dead. A Nepali soldier who spoke to CNN said Afghan, Indian, Congolese and Egyptian recruits were among those being trained in Russia’s military academies for foreign fighters."

Zygar was found guilty of “public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the armed forces of the Russian Federation,” according to the statement shared by the court on Tuesday. Under draconian media laws passed after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, discrediting the Russian military or spreading “fake news” about military operations can be grounds for prosecution in Russia. “The court’s verdict is ridiculous but fortunately I’m fine - unlike those political prisoners who are currently held in Russian prisons,” Zygar told CNN following the court’s decision. “I urge everyone not to forget about them. At the moment, almost 3,000 are being prosecuted for political charges in Russia,” he added.

He is the author of several renowned books, including “All the Kremlin’s Men,” which details the inner workings of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s administration, and “War and Punishment,” which examines the historical pretexts for Russia’s war on Ukraine . Zygar was designated a “foreign agent” by Russia’s Ministry of Justice in October 2022 and placed on an international wanted list in April 2024. The court said Zygar’s sentence will commence upon his extradition to or detention in Russia, although the Russian government has not successfully extradited any prominent dissidents or critics since the invasion of Ukraine. The verdict follows another conviction in absentia of a prominent Russian-American journalist, reporter and writer Masha Gessen , who lives in the United States. Gessen – an opinion columnist for The New York Times and the author of numerous books about Russia – was sentenced to eight years in prison for criticizing the Russian military last Monday. Another Russian journalist and blogger, Oleg Kashin, currently based in the United Kingdom, was placed on the wanted list last week, according to the Russian Interior Ministry, which did not specify the charge against him. Law enforcement agencies told state news agency TASS that the move might be related to Kashin’s alleged violation of foreign agent regulations."

According to a draft law supported by the State Duma Committee on Defense, carrying internet-connected cell phones whose data can identify Russian troops or the location of forces will be classified as a “gross disciplinary offense” punishable by up to 10 days of arrest. Multiple offenses could lead to up to 15 days of arrest. The law would also prohibit the use of other electronic devices meant for “household purposes” which allow for video and audio recording and the transmission of geolocation data. Both Russian and Ukrainian militaries have reportedly used enemy cell phones to identify targets during the war, scraping data from photos and messages to track coordinates and launch attacks. The United States and its “Five Eyes” intelligence allies – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom – warned last year that Russian military hackers had been targeting Ukrainian soldiers’ mobile devices in a bid to steal sensitive battlefield information. Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) also assessed that Russian hackers had sought to infiltrate the Android tablets used by the Ukrainian military for “planning and performing combat missions,” using code designed to steal data sent from the devices to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite system, which have been crucial to Ukraine’s battlefield communications .

Although the Kremlin has acknowledged the risks posed by soldiers carrying cell phones, Russian military bloggers have criticized the draft law, claiming it shows the Duma’s lack of understanding of the nature of modern warfare. “The bosses live on another planet,” one blogger, called “Obsessed with the Z War,” wrote on Telegram on Monday. Another blogger, Veteran Records, said: “Nowadays, gadgets are needed in war not just by individual specialists, now literally every soldier needs a gadget in war. And this is not a luxury or a whim – it is a necessity dictated by time and circumstances.” Instead of “uncontrolled” gadgets like smartphones, the blogger suggested creating a “controlled” gadget that cannot reveal sensitive battlefield information. “If we can’t create a gadget ourselves, let’s ask the Chinese, they’ll do anything for money,” they wrote. Russian soldiers are already banned from publicly distributing information that could reveal the identity or location of military personnel. Under Russia’s legislative process, draft laws must first be considered by the Duma, before progressing to the Federation Council, the upper house. The Council cannot amend laws passed by the Duma, but can approve or reject them."

Hungary’s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has ruffled feathers among EU leaders by claiming recently that the union has a “pro-war policy.” Borrell responded to Orban’s comment during a press conference in Brussels, saying, “I understood that we have to send a signal, even if it is a symbolic signal, that being against the foreign policy of the European Union and disqualifying the policy of the European Union as the ‘party of war’ has to have some consequences.” “We analyzed the statements and the actions implemented” by the Hungarian prime minister and foreign minister, the chief diplomat of the EU said. “I can say that all member states, with one single exception, were very much critical about this behavior,” he added. “European Union policy is not a pro-war policy. We strongly rejected that,” Borrel said, adding, “the only one who is pro-war is Putin.” The informal EU Council meetings of foreign and defense ministers were due to take place in Budapest from August 28 to 30, according to the EU council website, with Hungary currently holding the rotating European Union presidency. Borrell’s decision comes after European Council President Charles Michel firmly hit back at Orbán’s claim that the EU has led a “pro-war policy” in a letter published last week. “ Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,” Michel wrote. Orban visited the White House during Trump's presidency in 2019, and has more recently visited the former President in Florida.

The authoritarian Hungarian leader has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the Ukraine conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia’s military effort. In his letter to those leaders, Orban said that during the meetings there was a “general observation” that “the intensity of the military conflict” in Ukraine “will radically escalate in the near future.” A letter signed by over 63 European lawmakers, addressed to the three EU chiefs, said Orban had “caused significant damage” through his meetings. They called on the bloc’s leaders to suspend Hungary’s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that “mere verbal condemnation” of Hungary has “no effect.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later slammed the Hungarian prime minister’s visit to Moscow as an “appeasement mission.” In response, Orbán told CNN he was simply fulfilling his “Christian duty” by visiting Putin. “If you have a position and you can have an impact on bad things to improve it, you have to do so,” Orban told CNN last week.

More than two years on, another shift once unthinkable is underway on conscription.","Jul 21, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Radina Gigova,Ukraine,"CNN — Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine , many, including Kyiv, were skeptical that a major war could return to Europe. More than two years on, another shift once unthinkable is underway on conscription. Several European nations have reintroduced or expanded compulsory military service amid Moscow’s mounting threat, part of a range of policies aimed at boosting defenses that are likely to be scaled up even further. “We are coming to the realization that we may have to adjust the way we mobilize for war and adjust the way we produce military equipment and we recruit and train personnel,” said Robert Hamilton, head of Eurasia research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who served as a US Army officer for 30 years. “It is tragically true that here we are, in 2024, and we are grappling with the questions of how to mobilize millions of people to be thrown into a meatgrinder of a war potentially, but this is where Russia has put us,” he said. The risks for a larger war in Europe have been rising after Russian President Vladimir Putin “finally resorted to open conflict” in Ukraine, pursuing his aim to “recreate the Soviet empire,” said Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.), who served as NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe. “So we’ve now got a war in Europe that we never thought we would see again,” said Clark, who led NATO forces during the Kosovo War. “Whether this is a new Cold War or an emerging hot war is unclear,” he continued, but “it’s a very imminent warning to NATO that we’ve got to rebuild our defenses.” Those efforts include conscription, he says. Return of conscription underscores new reality A number of European countries halted mandatory conscription after the end of the Cold War, but several nations – particularly in Scandinavia and the Baltics – have reintroduced it in recent years, largely because of the Russian threat. Failure to enlist can result in fines or even jail time in some countries. Latvia is the latest to implement conscription. Compulsory military service  was reintroduced on January 1 this year, after being abolished in 2006. Male citizens will be put up for the draft within 12 months of reaching the age of 18, or graduation for those still in the education system. “At first there was a lot of pushback,” said Arturs Pīlācis, a 20-year-old student. He’s yet to go up for the draft but voluntarily went on a month-long military course. But ultimately, “the need for a state defence service was clear,” he said. “There wasn’t really an option where we can stand by and think things will go on as they were before because of the unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.” Latvian army servicemen with a M109A5 howitzer attend a military parade to celebrate the anniversary of the independence declaration in Riga, Latvia on November 18, 2022. Ints Kalnins/Reuters In April, Norway presented an ambitious long-term plan that will nearly double the country’s defense budget and add more than 20,000 conscripted soldiers, employees, and reservists to the armed forces. “We need a defense that is fit for purpose in the emerging security environment,” Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said. Conscription in Norway is mandatory and in 2015 it became the first member of the NATO defensive alliance to conscript both men and women on equal terms.

Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN Related article ‘Everyone will fight.’ Ukrainian men weigh their options as new draft law comes into effect Economics student Jens Bartnes, 26, completed his military training at the age of 19. “I am happy I did it, I learned a lot from that year that I wouldn’t learn otherwise – about myself, about my physical and mental limits and abilities I suppose, but also about teamwork. It’s a whole different way of life,” he said. “I am willing to fight for my country if need be, because I believe in the values that the Norwegian society is built on and I believe those values of inclusion and equality and democracy are worth fighting for,” Bartnes added. Max Henrik Arvidson, 25, was conscripted into the Norwegian military for one year between 2019 and 2020. Like Bartnes, he sees military service as an essential duty. “I know the only way we can stand against more Russian aggression is by keep supplying Ukraine with weapons and aid, while standing strong together with NATO as a whole and the European Union.” ‘Big mental shift’ Debates about conscription have also been taking place in other European countries that currently don’t require it. In the UK, the Conservatives floated the idea of military service in their ill-fated election campaign. But perhaps the most surprising transformation is underway in Germany , which since the end of World War II has had an aversion to militarization. In another first since the Cold War, Germany this year updated its plan should conflict erupt in Europe, and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius presented a proposal in June for a new voluntary military service. “We must be ready for war by 2029,” he said. Boris Pistorius, Federal Minister of Defense, visits the air base in B'chel and talks to soldiers on 18 July 2024. Thomas Frey/picture-alliance/dpa/AP “We are seeing the debate now raging. And that’s the first step,” said Sean Monaghan, a visiting fellow in the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This doesn’t happen overnight, it’s a big mental shift.” Not everyone is ready to answer the call. In Lithuania, for instance, opinions about military service among students vary, said Paulius Vaitiekus, president of Lithuania’s National Students’ Union. Since the country reintroduced compulsory military service in 2015 due to a “changed geopolitical situation,” about 3,500 to 4,000 Lithuanians between the ages of 18 and 26 are enlisted each year for a period of nine months. Vaitiekus said students have launched initiatives to send supplies to the Ukrainian frontlines. There was “a shift in the mindset of the youth towards being more active, although not necessarily through conscripting,” he added. With conscription remaining an unpopular topic in some countries, NATO is struggling to meet its new goal of having 300,000 personnel ready to be activated within one month and another half a million available within six months, Monaghan said. “While NATO has stated it has already met that goal, the EU has said its members would struggle. NATO relies on American forces to meet its target. European allies need to find new ways to generate personnel. Something has to give here,” he said. Another problem is that that target would only allow NATO to fight a relatively short conflict of up to six months, Monaghan added. Large strategic reserve force models A possible solution is a more nimble, modern military. One of NATO’s newest members , Finland, has the capacity to activate more than 900,000 reservists, with 280,000 military personnel being ready to respond immediately if needed. However, during peacetime, the Finnish Defence Forces employs only about 13,000 people, including civilian staff. “Finland is a good example” as its reserve force can be integrated into a very small active force, said Hamilton, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Historically, he explained, Finland was “wedged” between NATO and the Soviet Union, aligned with neither, so needed to be able to defend itself alone. Norway and Sweden , NATO’s newest member, have similar models, both maintaining significant numbers of reservists, though not as many as Finland. Sweden, where conscription is now also gender-neutral, called up around 7,000 individuals in 2024. The number will rise to 8,000 in 2025, according to the Swedish Armed Forces. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, “what we see is that both knowledge and the attitude have changed,” she said. “Sweden has had conscription since 1901 so it’s really part of our culture in a way,” said Marinette Nyh Radebo, communications manager at the agency that helps test recruits and reports to the Ministry of Defense. “When the conscription was activated again, in the beginning, we said that conscription is good for your CV, for applying for a new job for example,” Radebo said. “But today our communication is more like, this is a duty that you have to do for Sweden.” Soldiers on the parade ground at the base of the Swedish Army's Gotland Regiment near Visby, Sweden, on March 25, 2022. Mikael Sjoberg/Bloomberg/Getty Images Is NATO ready for war? The NATO alliance has been revising its strategy and boosting capabilities over the past decade in response to the growing threat from Moscow. Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022, which followed its support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, inevitably prompted allies to reassess whether they were ready for war and strengthen their defenses. “Since 2014, NATO has undergone the most significant transformation in our collective defense in a generation,” NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah told CNN. “We have put in place the most comprehensive defense plans since the Cold War, with currently more than 500,000 troops at high readiness.” But there are calls for allies to increase their capabilities further and faster. While NATO allies “are definitely ready to fight tonight,” there is still a question of whether they are ready for a protracted war such as that in Ukraine, Monaghan said, pointing out there is still work to be done in a number of areas. Those include industrial capacity, defense spending and societal resilience – where the question of conscription would come in.

Sean Gallup/Getty Images/File Related article Opinion: Ukraine deserves to hear the truth about NATO The way military personnel are recruited and trained is a decision for individual nations, Dakhlallah said, adding: “Around a third of NATO members have some form of compulsory military service.” “Some allies are weighing up conscription. However as an alliance we do not prescribe mandatory military service,” Dakhlallah said. “The important thing is that allies continue to have capable armed forces to protect our territory and our populations.” In addition to the fighting in Ukraine, Russia has also launched a hybrid war across Europe , experts say, involving attacks on infrastructure, cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, election interference and the weaponization of migration. “That has only become more aggressive,” Monaghan said. “All of which is to say NATO allies face a very different geopolitical situation than they did over the last couple of decades.” The situation could be further complicated by the US presidential election in November. Things will look very different if former President Donald Trump – who has said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO country that doesn’t meet the bloc’s defense spending guidelines – returns to the White House. “I think there is a very good understanding among the military leaders of NATO that they must cooperate, and there is a desire to do that,” Clark said. This year saw World War II veterans gather for D-Day commemorations , some possibly for the last time. Their descendants may now have to take on the kind of responsibility that it was hoped would not be needed again. “I think young people in Europe and the US will come to realize that this generation, like the generation that fought WWII, it didn’t ask to be the ‘Greatest Generation,’ but the circumstances thrust that burden on them,” Clark said. “In democracies, we don’t like to prepare for war, we don’t want to think about these things,” he said. However, “I think people will respond to the circumstances that they see.”"

Angry residents gathered on the streets near residential buildings shouting “Give me light,” after experiencing power cuts for several days, videos posted on social media show. Work to repair the accident is underway and residents are being supplied with drinking water, the city’s mayor Evgeny Naumov said Saturday. “We all need to remain calm and understand what is happening, although this is not easy,” he said in a Telegram post. The power cuts came as the city is experiencing unusually high temperatures and on Friday a daily record was set for the fourth day in a row, according to Russian state news agency TASS. The maximum temperature was 39 degrees Celsius on Friday, according to TASS. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said Saturday that the “abnormal heat,” the lack of proper capacities during peak load periods and the operation of the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant were some of the factors that contributed to the outages. One of the units of the Rostov plant, the largest in the region, was temporarily shut down earlier this week due to a technical malfunction. “There has been abnormal heat in the Krasnodar region for a week now. The load on the energy system is colossal,” Governor Kondratyev said. “I know and understand all the indignation of residents due to the power outages.” He said he is “in constant contact” with energy workers and that “Where possible, emergency crews repair breakdowns as quickly as possible.” Kondratyev said the city’s mayor is currently in the area that has been affected the most and “constantly reports on the situation.” Public protests in Russia are very rare, especially after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government has introduced war censorship laws that can result in severe punishment, including imprisonment, for discrediting the military."

Zelensky suggested Moscow should send a delegation to the next peace summit that he hopes to hold in November. Russia was not invited to the previous peace conference, held in Switzerland last month, as Zelensky said any talks could only happen after a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. Kyiv is currently facing the double whammy of a difficult frontline situation and political uncertainty over the level of future support from Ukraine’s closest allies.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Zelensky said Ukraine was not receiving enough Western assistance to win the war, pointing out that its outcome will be determined way beyond Ukraine’s borders. “Not everything depends on us. We know what would be a just end to the war, but it doesn’t depend only on us. It depends not only on our people and our desire, but also on finance, on weapons, on political support, on unity in the EU, in NATO, in the world,” the president said. Former US Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said it was plausible Zelensky’s shift in tone was a reaction to the events unfolding in the United States, where former President Donald Trump on Monday announced a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine, JD Vance, as his running mate. Speaking to CNN from the Aspen Security Forum, Herbst said that it was possible Zelensky was trying to reach out to the potential future Trump administration by stressing he would be willing to negotiate – as long as the deal on the table is just. “It has to be (a) reasonable peace, which does not permit Russian occupiers to continue to torture, repress and murder the people of Ukraine who are being occupied,” he said. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of torture and human rights abuses in Ukraine despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Trump and Zelensky spoke on Friday in what Trump called a “had a very good phone call”. The former president said he would “bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives” while Zelensky said the two discussed “what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.” Unacceptable terms Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeated several times in recent months that he would be willing to negotiate with Ukraine – albeit on terms that remain completely unacceptable to Ukraine and its Western allies. Putin said Russia would end its war in Ukraine if Kyiv surrendered the entirety of four regions claimed by Moscow: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Large swathes of these regions remain under Ukrainian control, so he is essentially asking Ukraine to give up territory without a fight. Putin also said any peace deal would require Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO, prompting Kyiv to call the proposal “offensive to common sense.” Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said that considering Putin’s public demands, Zelensky’s words were likely meant as a message to the rest of the world.

It is willing to sit at the negotiating table. But this cannot be totally on Russian terms, and it cannot lead to (the) capitulation of Ukraine to Russia … Putin is demanding the control of regions he can’t conquer militarily,” she told CNN. Lutsevych believes Putin has stepped up his calls for negotiations because he knows his window of opportunity may be closing. Despite being considerably bigger and stronger than Ukraine, Russia has not managed to fulfil its territorial goals – even when Kyiv was receiving only limited help from the West. Moscow’s initial attempt to take the capital ended up in a defeat and the front lines have not moved considerably in more than a year. Uncertainty ahead New US military assistance started reaching the front lines in Ukraine in May, after months of delays caused by political deadlock in the US Congress. At the same time, Ukraine finally received permission from some Western nations to use their weapons to strike targets inside Russia – although only in limited circumstances and in areas near the border with Ukraine. While this has helped slow Russian progress and averted a possible reoccupation of the Kharkiv region, Ukraine is still defending territory, rather than pushing forward to reclaim areas currently under Russian occupation. “Ukrainian forces are going to have to accumulate equipment, material and manpower for a future counteroffensive operation, and that’s part of the Russian calculus that we are seeing – the Russian military command very much appears to be pursuing a strategy where they are conducting consistent, grinding offensive operations throughout the entire front line,” said Riley Bailey, a Russia analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War. By making gradual, creeping advances along the more than 600-mile-long (1,000 kilometer) front line, Russia is forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive, Bailey said. “They will need to degrade the Russian forces and capabilities that are part of the offensive operations, which would bring some more flexibility and ease some of the pressure,” Bailey said. “Ukraine can then start making some operational choices that it hasn’t been able to make in the past few months.” But the success of any future Ukrainian counteroffensive will depend primarily on how much support it receives from its Western allies going forward. Zelensky said this week that the current level of support was enough to hold off further Russian advances, but not win the war. This week brought more uncertainty on that front, as Trump announced that he had picked Vance as his vice-presidential nominee. Vance has previously suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Trump himself has claimed he would “end the war in one day” and said the US shouldn’t be sending money to Ukraine with no strings attached. Ukrainian infantry fire at Russian positions in eastern Ukraine on July 5, 2024. Libkos/Getty Images At the same time, it emerged that Germany, which is among Ukraine’s biggest supporters, plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year – although it suggested Ukraine should be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the G7 last month. If the worst-case scenario for Ukraine was to materialize – if the US stopped providing aid, Europe didn’t step up its assistance and Ukraine wasn’t able to access the frozen Russian assets – Russia would likely start to make much bigger gains. Herbst said that if the Democrats win the US presidential election in November, the current US policy of supporting Ukraine is likely to continue, with more aid flowing in. “If Trump were to win, we don’t know what he will do. But we know that there are serious people on his national security team who will understand that Putin is a direct threat to American interests and that it is important or critical to the US that Putin lose in Ukraine,” he added. But Herbst said there is one more factor which could convince a possible Trump administration to keep helping Ukraine. “If his team cuts off aid, and Ukraine collapses, that will be a major defeat to the United States, caused by the Trump team. And a defeat that would dwarf the embarrassment and the damage done by Biden’s incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. And there will be people on his team that will understand that,” he said. Analysts expect the Ukraine aid package – the more than $60 billion approved by the US Congress earlier this year – to last Kyiv about a year to 18 months, which could be enough time for Ukraine to regroup and launch a new counteroffensive. Lutsevych said that Ukraine desperately needs to make battlefield gains and then see if there is a real desire by Russia to negotiate – which she says doesn’t currently come across as genuine. “But what evidence do we have that Russians are willing to negotiate? Putin is putting his country on a total war footing,” she said, adding that the war will likely end only if Moscow begins to feel threatened. “I think this war will end when Putin begins to feel that the Russian control over Crimea is threatened.” Ukrainian servicemen of the 148th Separate Artillery Brigade of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, prepare a M777 howitzer before fire toward Russian troops near a front line, amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine May 1, 2024.

It seems to be working Ukraine has already stepped up its attacks against the peninsula, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and home to Moscow’s Black Sea fleet. Kyiv claims its military has struck and sunk or severely damaged several Russian warships in the area, disabling at least a third of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. Ukraine has also managed to hit and temporarily shut down the Kerch Strait bridge that connects Crimea with Russia on several occassions. The southern front – which stretches from the Donbas in eastern Ukraine across the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, with Russian-occupied territory creating a land bridge between Russia and Crimea – will be a key target. While Zelensky’s tone might have shifted this week, his position on what a peace deal should look like hasn’t, or at least not publicly. The majority of Ukrainians do not want the government to give up any territory at all. “Right now, it is politically difficult, if not impossible, to state that a peace can be achieved without the full return of all Ukrainian territories. But that doesn’t mean that over time, it couldn’t become possible,” Herbst said. He believes Kyiv could “speak with some justification of Ukrainian victory in this war,” even if Ukraine doesn’t manage to get back all of its pre-war territory – as long as it reclaims enough to be an economically viable and secure state. “But for it to be a secure state, especially in those circumstances, it must be a member of NATO. I believe that if this were truly on the table, meaning with the full faith and power of the United States behind it, this in theory could lead to a stable peace,” he said. “It wouldn’t be a just peace, because you’re still consigning millions of Ukrainians to the tender mercies of a vicious regime of the Kremlin, which has shown it has no love — and that’s a very polite way to phrase it — for Ukrainians who believe they are Ukrainians, and not little Russians.” CNN’s Olga Voitovych contributed reporting."

In February, he told the Munich Security Conference “the American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,” arguing that in a world where munitions manufacturing is limited, the only option for Ukraine is a negotiated settlement.

The former president has also hinted at paring back military aid to Ukraine and claimed that he could have the war settled through negotiation in 24 hours if reelected. And yet the mood among European leaders arriving in the rolling Oxfordshire countryside is one of resignation, and resolve. “I think whoever wins the US race… it will be more America first,” Belgium’s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told CNN. “And I think the only answer to that is Europe needs to stand on its own legs… what we see in the Republican convention confirms that.” Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, the head of one of NATO’s newest members, has read Vance’s book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” describing it as “very good.” On the isolationist leanings of a Trump-Vance ticket, he is circumspect. “Am I worried? No. Because the United States wants to remain a superpower,” he told CNN. Sen. JD Vance speaks on the third night of the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, July 17, in Milwaukee. Will Lanzoni/CNN “Is there a rebalancing going on? Yes. Europe needs to take care of its defense more.” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen argues Europe stepping up its commitment to its own security has nothing to do with the US. “We have to be more capable of defending ourselves, with a more and more aggressive Russia, not only when it comes to Ukraine,” she told CNN. “It’s every day now that we’ve seen hybrid attacks, cyber attacks, disinformation.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, just two weeks into the job, was hoping the Thursday summit involving 42 European heads of state or government would be a strong show of unity, “a signal to Russia of our resolve.” And yet one EU leader has signaled something quite different to Russia. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has never supported military aid to Ukraine, chose the first week of his rotating EU presidency this month to visit President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, on what he called a “peace mission.” CNN video Related video ‘Don’t be so negative toward Trump or JD Vance’: U.S. foreign policy vet’s advice to Europe The visit was about fulfilling his “Christian duty” Orban told CNN on Thursday. “I try to do my best to convince everybody that peace is better than a war… it’s not easy to convince them.” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, reelected Thursday to another five-year term, called the trip “an appeasement mission.” Speaking at the meeting at Blenheim Palace, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was blunt. Preserving European unity is critical to a long-lasting peace, he said . “But if someone in Europe tries to resolve issues behind others’ backs… if someone wants to make some trips to the capital of war… then why should we consider such a person? The EU and NATO can address all their issues without this one individual.” Europe did manage a show of unity, but one that faces mounting tests, including the prospect of a new US administration that may pull its support for Ukraine, and an increasingly active Ukraine-skeptic in its midst."

Satellite images have revealed that several Pantsir-S1 air defense systems have been installed in the vicinity of the presidential residence on Lake Valdai in Novgorod region. The Valdai residence could be a high-profile target, as Putin is known to be spending time there during the summer. The palatial property sits inside a large government vacation resort in the Valdai national park, on a peninsula wedged between two lakes. Access to the whole complex is severely restricted – the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park. First reported by Radio Liberty, satellite images show the Russian-made Pantsir-S1s have been moved into the area at some point between last September and this May, just as Ukraine became better at developing and using drones capable of striking deeper inside Russia.

Courtesy: Maxar Technologies Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies show air defenses strategically positioned in the area, including on a tower located deep in a forest just a few kilometers away from the compound. The Pantsir-S1 systems are designed to combat short-range cruise missiles and drones, suggesting the move to station them near the residence may be a response to Ukraine’s increasingly audacious drone attacks. CNN has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment but has not received a response. Kyiv has recently been given permission to use Western weapons to strike across the border into Russia, but this is limited to military targets that are near the border with the Ukrainian Kharkiv region and are supporting Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. For any strikes deeper into Russia than that, Ukraine must rely on its own weapons. Drones are a big part of the strategy. Ukraine’s drone program has grown significantly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. What began with efforts to modify cheap, off-the-shelf drones that could be used for surveillance has turned into the development of long-range attack drones that are capable of striking hundreds of miles beyond Ukraine’s borders. So far this year, Kyiv has claimed that Ukrainian drones sank or severely damaged several Russian warships in the Black Sea and caused damage to the Kerch Strait bridge between Russia and Ukraine’s Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. People clear rubble from a building of one of the largest children’s hospitals of Ukraine, ‘Okhmatdyt’, partially destroyed by a Russian missile strike on July 8, 2024 in Kyiv, Ukraine.

In April, it said its drones hit the Niznekamsk oil refinery – one of the five largest in Russia – in Tatarstan region, more than 1,100 km (700 miles) from the border. And last month, the Ukrainian military said it had destroyed one of Russia’s newest and most advanced fighter jets, the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, with a drone strike almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines. “Ukrainian drone strikes deep within Russia continue to pressure Russia’s air defense umbrella and force the Russian military command to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to cover what it deems to be high-value targets,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based group, said in a battlefield update on Wednesday, pointing to the decision by Russia to move the Pantsir-S1 systems there. The presidential residence is well protected from would-be invaders. Access to the complex is severely restricted – the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park. A special permit is required to access the wider park and the resort is completely off-limits – according to its official website, it has been closed indefinitely since last November. The retreat’s history as a vacation destination for Russia’s top officials dates back to the time of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who had a dacha – or summer house – built in the area, according to the Russian Presidential Property Management Department, the body that manages the holiday complex. Nikita Khrushchev and Boris Yeltsin both enjoyed time at the residence, according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti. CNN’s Allegra Goodwin contributed reporting."

Now that the former president has picked JD Vance as his running mate, they potentially have a lot more to worry about. By choosing Vance, Trump has sent a clear signal that, if elected, his America-first foreign policy will be back in force. Vance, a junior senator for Ohio, is a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine as it tries to defend itself against Russia . Like Trump, he has repeatedly criticized NATO and its European members for not spending enough on defense. And he has made a number of comments that have raised eyebrows across the pond – including when he said the United Kingdom would become the “first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon” under the new Labour government. His nomination puts an end to the hopes by some of America’s allies that Trump might soften his foreign policy stance if reelected. That hope was fueled by Trump himself. While he has often repeated his claim that he “would end the war” in Ukraine in one day if reelected and said he would not send any more money to Kyiv, he stopped short of getting his allies in Congress to block the $61 billion aid package approved earlier this year.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Related article The West finally allowed Ukraine to strike back at Russia — and it seems to be working “He could have told members (of the Congress) not to vote for it and instead he tacitly allowed it to go through,” said Kristine Berzina, a geopolitics and security expert who leads the German Marshall Fund of the United States’ Geostrategy North program. “So there was a sense in Washington that Trump has been in a fairly pro-Ukrainian moment, and that he should have the benefit of the doubt – perhaps his views on Europe and Ukraine have evolved, especially given the much higher defense spending in Europe now,” she told CNN in an interview. But with the selection of his running mate, Trump dashed these hopes. “JD Vance does not appear to be interested in being a good ally to Europe,” Berzina said. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Ukraine and NATO have dismissed that scenario, because it would most likely mean Kyiv would have to give up some of its pre-war territory. “I think what’s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace. I think Russia has incentive to come to the table right now. I think Ukraine, Europe and the United States have incentives to come to the table,” he said at the conference, adding that the fact that Putin “is a bad guy does not mean we can’t engage in basic diplomacy.” On Wednesday, Russia welcomed Vance’s stance on Ukraine. “He (Vance) stands for peace, for cessation of aid. We can only welcome this because, in fact, it is necessary to stop pumping Ukraine with weapons, and the war will end,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press conference at the United Nations. Lavrov added that Russia “will be ready to work with any American leader elected by the American people” as long as this leader “is ready for an equitable, mutually respectful dialogue.” In Munich, Vance notably skipped a key meeting between a bipartisan delegation of US senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he didn’t think he’d learn anything new there. He did attend a meeting with Zelensky in Washington in December but left early . Asked by CNN’s Kaitlin Collins about Vance’s assertion that the outcome of the war would not change even if Ukraine received US funding, Zelensky said Vance did “not understand what is going on here.” “To understand it is to come to the frontline to see what’s going on… without this support. And he will understand that millions of people will be killed,” he added. “He doesn’t understand it, of course, God bless you don’t have the war on your territory.” Senator JD Vance speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill. Jose Luis Magana/AP Pivot to China Vance has argued that the US should turn its focus away from Russia and toward East Asia. Earlier this week, he said the war in Ukraine must be brought to a “rapid close” so that America could focus on “the real issue, which is China.” That’s the “biggest threat to our country and we’re completely distracted from it,” Vance said in an interview with Fox News Monday. In an op-ed published in the New York Times in April, Vance also argued that US efforts to supply Ukraine with air defense systems could be detrimental to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. “These weapons are not only needed by Ukraine. If China were to set its sights on Taiwan, the Patriot missile system would be critical to its defense,” he wrote. The idea that East Asia, and China specifically, poses as big, if not a bigger, threat to the US than Russia is not unique to Vance. Trevor McCrisken, an US foreign policy expert and associate professor at the University of Warwick, said there is bipartisan agreement between Democrats and Republicans that China is the biggest threat internationally to US interests. “Both parties say you’ve got to be strong, and you’ve got to prevent China from fulfilling whatever ambitions it might have, economically, militarily, and so on. It’s just that most Democrats and the more moderate Republicans believe that Russia is also a threat,” he told CNN in an interview. In the eyes of most Western leaders, the threats from China and Russia go hand in hand. Just last week, NATO leaders called China a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war on Ukraine in the alliance’s most forceful statement on Beijing’s involvement in the conflict.

Historically, the US has had to go in and bail out Europe so many times.” Sam Greene, the director of the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and a professor of Russian politics at King’s College London, said Vance’s nomination should make it clear to America’s allies that the shift toward the Trumpian kind of Republican foreign policy is likely more long-term. “The last time we had a Trump presidency, I think Europeans looked at this as potentially a four-year blip, and then breathed a sigh of relief when Biden was elected and thought that we’d return to normal … and I think that there was some wishful thinking in that, and people have now begun to recognize that,” he said. The effect of this shift, Greene said, is apparent even now – despite the White House being in Democratic hands. US President Joe Biden had an extremely hard time getting the latest Ukraine aid package through Congress, forcing Ukraine’s European allies to start thinking about a plan B. The initial delay in Congress approving the package resulted in a Czech-led initiative to find and fund alternative sources of ammunition for Kyiv, among other efforts to look for assistance elsewhere. “The unreliability of American leadership in Europe has been a fact that Europeans have now had some time to get used to. Even if Biden is reelected, America will be difficult to rely on,” Greene said. If Trump chose someone with a more traditional foreign policy stance to be a running mate – for example the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, America’s allies could have hoped that post-Trump, the Republican party might pivot back to what Greene called “trans-Atlantic solidarity.” “But if in fact, not only are we looking at another Trump administration, but we’re looking at a future of the Republican Party that is dominated by people like JD Vance, then that is a much more sobering prospect for Europe,” he said.

For the first time in 12 years, Ukraine will be represented in all the synchronized disciplines of high dive and the 3-meter springboard, for both men and women. “We live under constant pressure,” said Psymenska, who will be competing at her third Olympics. “During the day, we spend all our energy preparing for the Games. But at night, we wake up either from explosions or from the sound of sirens. It’s a lot of stress.” Anna was born in central Ukraine but later moved to live and train in the eastern city of Luhansk. She left in 2014 when Russian forces occupied that territory. “I didn’t even bring my things with me. I never thought I’d ever come back there again,” said the diver. Psymenska says she has a recurring dream ever since fleeing: going back to Luhansk, but Russians won’t let her leave town. Anna Pysmenska hiding in a basement in February 2022. Courtesy Anna Pysmenska She then moved her training to Kyiv until February 2022, when Russia again tried to invade the city where she lived. Following the start of the war, Psymenska moved to Croatia with her team before returning to Kyiv in the summer of 2022. But constant Russian attacks make preparation and concentration challenging. “We train every day. Physically, we are ready. But morally, it’s quite difficult. I was hysterical a few days ago. Because of the constant blackouts, I eat incomprehensibly. You can’t plan anything. The lights are never on. It’s the Stone Age. It’s very unnerving,” said Psymenska. Blackouts and sirens As Russia continues to strike Ukraine’s energy facilities across the country, blackouts have become longer. The Ukrainian Diving Federation had to buy a powerful generator for the swimming pool where the divers train to deal with constant power outages. If an air raid siren sounds during practice, the athletes immediately stop and go down to the bomb shelter. “Diving is a difficult sport,” Ilya Tselutin, the national team coach, said to CNN. “Before jumping, you have to prepare and warm up. Coming back after, athletes have to prepare again from scratch before jumping.” National diving team coach Ilya Tselutin with team members. Courtesy Ukrainian Diving Federation There are set to be 136 divers from around the world who will participate at the 2024 Olympic Games in France. A panel of judges will score each dive based on various criteria, including how aesthetically pleasing a diver’s movements are, the complexity of the dive and how well they enter the water. Synchronized diving is also scored on how well the two divers match each other’s movements. But for Tselutin, these Games are more than just about the sport of diving. “The task of the divers is to win top-level medals and to raise the Ukrainian flag as high as possible. This is their front right now. To show that our country is very strong, that the nation is invincible,” he said. A debut in Paris The Paris Games will be 21-year-old Danylo Konovalov’s first Olympics. Each day he begins at 7 a.m. and has two training sessions.

His parents still live in Mykolaiv, a city that Russian forces constantly hit. “I’m not reading the news. I feel much calmer this way. My mom calls me and tells me how things are so that I can concentrate on a sport,” Konovalov said to CNN. On July 5, the diving team had a farewell ceremony in Kyiv. It began with a priest’s blessing at a church near the pool where the athletes train. Konovalov admits that he has a few superstitions that he religiously observes. “I have my lucky swimwear in which I jump well. It’s also important to find the right place for your slippers. If the jump goes well, I only put my slippers in the same place,” he said.

Orban’s letter, addressed to European Council President Charles Michel and sent to all European Union leaders, was written in the wake of his controversial meetings with former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “I can […] surely state that shortly after his election victory, he will not wait until his inauguration, [Trump] will be ready to act as a peace broker immediately. He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,” Orban wrote. The authoritarian Hungarian premier has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia’s military effort. In his letter to those leaders, Orban said that during the meetings there was a “general observation” that “the intensity of the military conflict” in Ukraine “will radically escalate in the near future.” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski addresses a press conference with EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at the Foreign Ministry in Warsaw, Poland on February 5, 2024.

Orban – a rare, longtime ally of Trump in the EU – has undertaken what he has previously called his “peace missions,” meeting Putin in Moscow on July 5 and Xi in Beijing on July 8. Last Thursday he met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. He also visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv at the start of July, marking his first visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Orban called on EU leaders to try to find a “window of opportunity” to usher in a “new chapter” in EU policy in his letter, urging them to “make an effort to decrease tensions and/or create the conditions for a temporary ceasefire and/or start peace negotiations” in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency last month, unveiling a slogan – “Make Europe Great Again” – that mimicked Trump’s 2016 election motto. But his visits with Putin, Xi and Trump have gone down poorly with EU lawmakers, who have accused Orban of vitally “misrepresenting” and “undermining” the EU’s stance on foreign policy. In a letter to Orban Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel hit back against many of the points made by the Hungarian prime minister. “The most direct way to peace is for Russia to withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the UN Charter,” Michel wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. Michel wrote that “no discussion about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine” and rejected Orban’s claim that the EU has led a “pro-war policy,” saying that “it is quite the opposite.” “Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,” Michel wrote. Michel noted “the EU’s position on Ukraine is agreed by consensus by the European Council, and was confirmed most recently in June.” The European Council president also told Orban that Hungary, which holds the rotating presidency of the council until the end of the year, “has no role in representing the (European Union) on the international stage and received no European Council mandate to engage on behalf of the union.” “I made this clear even prior to your visit to Moscow and this was subsequently reiterated by High Representative Borrell in his statement of July 5,” Michel wrote. Michel said in his letter that he would share it with the other members of the European Council, and would “also inform Ukraine of this exchange.” A separate letter signed by 63 European lawmakers , addressed to the three EU chiefs, said Orban had “caused significant damage” through his meetings. “In his so-called peace mission, Prime Minister Orban deliberately left the impression that he was acting on behalf of the entire European Union, whereas in reality he has no authority to represent the EU or any other member state other than his own,” the Members of European Parliament said. The lawmakers called the meetings particularly damaging considering that Hungary currently holds the presidency of the European Council, saying Orban was guilty of “abusing” the position that he assumed at the beginning of July. EU lawmakers finished their letter by calling on the bloc’s three leaders, Michel, Ursula von der Leyen and Roberta Metsola, to suspend Hungary’s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that past examples had shown that “mere verbal condemnation” of Hungary has “no effect.”"

Gessen was convicted in absentia on charges of disseminating “false information” about the Russian armed forces, according to the Moscow court statement. The Russian-born journalist and writer is an opinion columnist for The New York Times and the author of numerous books about Russia, including the award–winning “The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia.” Gessen, who lives in the United States, has been heavily critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine and, over many years, has condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on human and LGBTQ+ rights. In a letter posted to Facebook Monday, Gessen called the charges “illegal and unfounded.” Gessen, who uses “they/them” pronouns, said that “as far as I understand from the indictment,” the charge is related to an interview they conducted with anti-war Russian blogger Yuri Dud , which was published on YouTube.

My statements are based on data collected during my journalistic work,” Gessen said, highlighting a series of interviews they conducted in Bucha, Irpin, Kyiv, and Kryvyi Rih in 2022, as well as their previous journalistic work in Chechnya. “Based on this work, I believe that Russian military personnel committed a number of war crimes in Bucha, Irpin, and other settlements of Ukraine, namely: murder of civilians, illegal detentions, torture, and looting.” “Many years of experience in other conflict zones allow me to say that these actions are not exceptional but, on the contrary, quite typical for Russian military personnel,” Gessen added. “This is exactly what was discussed in the interview with Yuri Dud.” The YouTube interview has been viewed more than 6.6 million times since its release in September 2022. The International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as a number of Western states and international institutions, have accused Russia of war crimes during its ongoing war in Ukraine. In March, the ICC charged two high-ranking Russian officials with directing attacks at civilians, causing excessive harm to civilians, and the crime against humanity of inhumane acts. While the Russian military has conducted its invasion, the Kremlin has sought to stifle criticism of its strategy at home. A number of prominent anti-war figures have been sentenced and convicted since February 2022, under vague new laws that punish what the Kremlin deems to be fake news about its military. “Criminal prosecution is an attempt to punish me for the conscientious and consistent fulfillment of my professional duties,” Gessen said. “I am outside the Russian Federation, so the so-called court can ‘consider’ my case, ‘arrest,’ and ‘sentence’ me only in absentia. However, I regard the criminal prosecution and putting me on the wanted list as an attempt to intimidate me and prevent me from carrying out my professional activities.” The trial of American journalist Evan Gershkovich is meanwhile set to resume Thursday, having been brought forward at the request of the defense, Russia’s Sverdlovsk regional court has said. Gershkovich is the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War. His trial began last month, with the journalist appearing in the courtroom’s glass cage, his head recently shaved. He was arrested while on a reporting trip for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release."

Sikorski explained that some missiles fired from around St. Petersburg fly along the Polish border through Belarusian airspace, before briefly entering Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before hitting targets inside Ukraine. “Our dilemma is the following: if we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace, the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property,” he said. “And the Ukrainians are saying, ‘Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they’re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory,’” he said, “To my mind, that’s self-defense but we are exploring the idea.” Chinese troops arrive in Belarus for drills Belarus Ministry of Defence Related article China and Belarus conduct joint military exercises right next to NATO and EU’s border Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Warsaw to sign a security cooperation agreement between the two countries. Sikorski said the idea of Poland downing Russian missiles was discussed in that agreement. “At this stage, this is an idea. What our agreement said is we will explore this idea,” he said. On Wednesday, Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz told Polish national radio service Polskie Radio 24 that such a decision would only be made with NATO allies. “If NATO does not make such a decision, Poland will not make it individually,” Kosiniak-Kamysz said. However, speaking in an interview with Ukrainian national TV later on Sunday, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg appeared to pour cold water on the idea, saying the bloc would not become part of the conflict. Asked to comment on the Polish idea, he said that NATO would not get “involved directly.”"

But only now can they finally strike where it hurts: Inside Russia’s territory.,"Jul 15, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Ivana Kottasová,Ukraine,"CNN — Bankir and his men have been trying to fight off Russian attacks along the Ukrainian front lines for more than two years. But it’s only now that they are finally able to strike where it hurts : Inside Russia’s own territory. The newly granted permission by the United States and other allies to use Western weapons to strike inside Russia has had a huge impact, Bankir said. “We have destroyed targets inside Russia, which allowed for several successful counteroffensives. The Russian military can no longer feel impunity and security,” the senior officer in Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN. For security reasons, he asked to be identified by his call sign only. After many months on the back foot because of ammunition and manpower shortages, Kyiv is finally able to take full advantage of Western military aid that started to flow into the country last month, after months of delays . Soldiers on the front lines say the deliveries are beginning to make a difference – especially since they can now use the arsenal to strike across the border at certain military targets supporting Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. “We can see the impact of the aid every day. Artillery, longer-range multiple launch rocket systems with various types of ammunition and submunitions… it’s affecting the overall battlefield picture,” Ivan, an officer with the 148th artillery brigade, told CNN. He also asked for his full name not to be published for security reasons. “We are deploying the most effective weapons systems in the areas where the Russians are trying to break through the defensive lines and there has been a significant slowdown in the Russian advance,” he added. While Kyiv hasn’t managed to reclaim large swathes of territory, it has successfully averted what could have been a disaster: The occupation of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city.

Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters ‘Tragic moment’ Part of the northern Kharkiv region, including the cities of Izium, Kupiansk, and Balakliia, fell into Russian hands soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The occupation was brutal. When the area was liberated in the fall of 2022 , Ukrainian troops found evidence of what they say were war crimes committed by Russian forces, including multiple mass graves and torture chambers. In May this year, Russia launched another cross-border attack on the region, trying to exploit Ukraine’s ammunition shortages before the expected arrival of the first Western weapons. The consequences were deadly. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said that at least 174 civilians were killed and 690 were injured in Ukraine in May, the highest number of civilian casualties in a year.

International security expert Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian defense official and the co-director of foreign relations and international security programs at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told CNN that the re-occupation of previously liberated areas north of Kharkiv was a “tragic moment” for Ukraine. But it also marked a major turning point. “It triggered a change in the position of our Western partners, it encouraged them to, at least partially, remove the restrictions on the use of the Western weapons,” he said. Fearing an escalation, the US and other Western allies had long prohibited Kyiv from using their weapons to strike inside Russia, restricting their use to Ukrainian areas under Russian occupation. That has allowed Russia to use the border areas as safe staging grounds for offensives and missile attacks. “(Russia) knew that Ukraine did not have the capacity to strike these targets on the Russian territory,” Melnyk said. “If the decision (to provide aid) wasn’t made, if we lost American support and military assistance, that would have been a game changer.” But the possibility of Russian re-occupation of parts of Kharkiv region convinced some of Ukraine’s key allies, including the US, to lift the restrictions. This allowed Kyiv to hit and destroy or severely damage key targets inside Russia.

Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Related article Before Biden can save Ukraine, he must use the NATO summit to save himself According to Ukrainian defense authorities, these included a regiment command post in Belgorod region, an ammunition depot in Voronezh, a drone facility and an airfield in Krasnodar, communication centers in Bryansk and several naval sites in occupied Crimea. The arrival of long-range ATACMS missile systems was a particular game-changer, Melnyk said. While Ukraine was previously able to strike targets inside Russia using Ukraine-made drones, ATACMS make these strikes far more efficient. “Speed matters,” Melnyk explained. “With drone strikes, Russians have hours to react, because they can detect Ukrainian drones early. Russian pilots can have a coffee and a cigarette before jumping into the cockpit and taking off to take it down. With the ATACMS, it’s a matter of minutes,” he said. Konrad Muzyka, an independent defense analyst  and the director of Rochan Consulting who has recently returned from eastern Ukraine, said Russia is also no longer able to target Kharkiv region with S-300 and S-400 missile systems. “Ukraine started conducting HIMARS strikes on targets in the Belgorod region and forced the Russians to push their S-300 system with which they were striking Kharkiv much further away, so now Kharkiv is beyond their range of Russian S-300 systems,” he said. While Russia switched to aerial glide bombs – guided munitions with pop-up wings dropped by fighter jets from a distance of some 60-70 kilometers – out of range of Ukraine’s air defenses, the elimination of the S-300 threat has provided at least some relief to Kharkiv.

But while the new weapons are making some difference, Ukraine is long way off being able to push Russian forces off its territory. Another officer with the 148th separate artillery brigade who goes by call sign Senator told CNN that there is still a lot more that Ukraine needs. “It isn’t enough to turn the tide at the front. Enough to hold the enemy back, yes, but not enough to change the situation dramatically,” he said. “The enemy is now exhausted but not destroyed,” he said, pointing to the fact that Russia still has complete air superiority over Ukraine. Kyiv is now pinning its hopes on the deliveries of F-16 fighter jets which should start soon – the first Ukrainian pilots were set to complete their training in the US this summer. But Muzyka said it is far from certain the jets will bring a massive change to Ukraine’s fortunes.

David Ake/Getty Images Related article Opinion: As NATO leaders meet in Washington, 5,000 miles away desperation sets in “The F-16s are combat aircraft from 1980s and 1990s and their capabilities are worse than the most modern Russian combat aircraft,” he said, adding that the newest Russian jets would likely prevail in an air battle with the F-16. However, Ukraine can still use the F-16 to deny Russia control over the skies – and push away Russian aircraft delivering bombs. Yet the new weapons are just part of the puzzle. “If it had not been for the supplemental package, Ukrainians would be in a much worse situation right now, but at the same time, the current situation is not only the result of a lack of actions by the US Congress, it’s also the result of the decisions that were made and were not made in Kyiv, especially when it comes to mobilization,” Muzyka said. “The decision to introduce a wider mobilization was probably as important, if not more important, and it came too late,” he said. The new mobilization law, which requires all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military, came into effect in May. He said that while Ukraine has managed to recruit a significant number of men over the past month and half, it will take time for these new soldiers to be trained up and ready for the front lines. “Ukrainians are going to be in a very difficult position until August, September, when the first mobilized guys start to enter the front line. If they can get to that point, then there is a big likelihood that they will manage to stabilize the situation from August onwards, but until this happens, more Russian gains are highly likely.” Muzyka said that with the new weapons arriving and battalions and brigades getting a boost soon from the new recruits, Ukraine will need to decide on its next steps. “It is unclear what the plans are. What is the strategy for counteroffensives? The problem is that Ukraine is waiting to see what equipment the West can supply them with, and the West is waiting to see what plans Ukraine have for the future,” he said. Time is of the essence here. Experts estimate that the $60 billion US aid package approved earlier this year will last for – at best – a year or 18 months. Ukraine’s allies made fresh pledges on arms this week while at a NATO summit in Washington, DC, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for all restrictions on their usage to be lifted. Given the possibility of former US President Donald Trump winning a second term in November – he has little time to spare. Maria Kostenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina contributed reporting.

While the US president – who faces mounting pressure over whether he is fit enough to serve another term in office – played down the gaffe at a high-stakes news conference later that day, the incident was scrutinized internationally. Russian state media seized on Biden’s performance to further criticize the NATO alliance, saying it turned the event into “a farce.” CNN video Related video See moment Biden mistakenly calls Zelensky ‘President Putin’ However, when asked by press at Ireland’s Shannon Airport Saturday what his reaction was to the error, Zelensky shrugged and said, “It was a mistake.” “I think United States gave a lot of support for Ukrainians.

The Biden Administration announced a new $2.3 billion military aid package for Ukraine on Wednesday, and said an additional $2.2 billion will be purchased for Ukraine from US arms manufacturers under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which provides Kyiv with longer-term support. Weeks earlier, the United States and Ukraine signed a bilateral security pact , which commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, as well as more weapons support and intelligence sharing. Zelensky at the time described the security pact as “a bridge to Ukraine’s membership in NATO.” In May, Biden also accepted a request from Ukraine for a change in policy, giving Ukraine permission to strike inside Russian territory , close to the Kharkiv border, with American munitions."

The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said. The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature. When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US. For more than six months, Russia has been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe, largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism — all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv. But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west. Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German manufacturer of the vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine’s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine in the coming weeks , an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow’s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel.

Fabian Bimmer/Pool/Getty Images The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign — one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe. “We’re seeing sabotage, we’re seeing assassination plots, we’re seeing arson. We’re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,” a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. “I believe very much that we’re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.” The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement, “Russia’s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. “The United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,” she said. “We have also been clear that Russia’s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.” The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement, “Russia’s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. “The United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,” she said. “We have also been clear that Russia’s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.” German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN’s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it shows how Russia is “waging a hybrid war of aggression” on European allies. “We have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,” Baerbock said. In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin “will not be intimidated by the Russian threats﻿,” emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at “undermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.” A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment. “The necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,” Hoffman said. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing Russia’s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion among NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc’s 75th anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country. But the campaign — and in particular Russia’s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil — has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all. Russia’s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a shotgun approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland, CNN has reported , a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company. Some analysts have referred to the effort as a “hybrid” campaign, one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia’s sabotage efforts that way. “I fundamentally reject the idea that what we’re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of ‘hybrid’, I think of … defacing monuments,” the senior NATO official said. “Things that meet that traditional definition of ‘below the threshold of armed conflict.’” Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations — lethal action — “I’m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that ‘hybrid’ implies,” the official said. It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy. Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat’s car: US military bases across Europe were placed on a heightened state of alert last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed actors were considering carrying out sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw’s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And French authorities last month detained a Russian-Ukrainian man who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow.

Dariusz Borowicz/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/Reuters “They’re doing it now because they believe that as there are a number of elections happening throughout the west, that this is a prime opportunity to try to undermine public support for Ukraine,” the senior NATO official said. The official also said that Russia sees a window of opportunity before additional weapons and ammunition promised by the west arrive on the battlefield in Ukraine. For Russia, this “is a prime time to target the west in these types of operations to try to undermine support and prevent the flow of weapons there.” CNN’s Zachary Cohen, Nadine Schmidt and Chris Stern contributed to this report."

Russia is “undertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,” the official said, adding that Russia’s preference for US presidential candidates has not changed from previous election cycles. The official declined to elaborate, but US intelligence previously assessed that in the 2020 US election, Russia conducted a range of influence operations to denigrate Joe Biden’s candidacy and support Donald Trump’s candidacy.

Iran is a chaos agent, and China is holding fire on the presidential race,” the ODNI official said. “We assess China, for now, does not plan to influence the outcome of the presidential race, because it sees little gain in choosing between two parties that it perceives as both seeking to contain Beijing,” the official said. All three countries have denied trying to interfere in or influence US elections. ODNI officials did not reveal many specific examples of what they see as Russian election influence activity, but they said it has included familiar tactics such as amplifying influential US voices online to promote the Kremlin’s agenda. Artificial intelligence is making the job easier. AI allows Russian operatives to mimic an American Southern or Midwestern accent in ways that native Russian speakers would fail to, the ODNI official said. Separately on Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the disruption of nearly a thousand social media accounts that officials said Russia operatives were using to pose as US residents and parrot Kremlin propaganda about the war in Ukraine. Iran, meanwhile, “seeks to stoke social divisions and undermine confidence in the US democratic institutions around the elections,” the ODNI official said at the press briefing. “Iran has demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting US political and social tensions through a variety of means, including social media.” Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the United States related to the conflict in Gaza , US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in a statement on Tuesday. China’s ‘unwieldy’ foreign influence apparatus Historically, China has shown less interest than Russia in sowing divisions among Americans during US elections, according to intelligence officials. But there have been recent indications that Chinese operatives have become more willing to directly target American voters. Since 2020, senior Chinese officials have issued broad directives to Chinese operatives to “intensify efforts to influence US policy and public opinion in China’s favor,” and senior Chinese officials have aimed to “magnify US societal divisions,” according to a US intelligence assessment declassified in December. Those influence efforts have included using fake social media accounts to attack US politicians online. The subject has become a source of tension in US-China relations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN previously reported . But US officials have been skeptical of Xi’s ability to control the vast Chinese bureaucracy when it comes to potential election influence efforts. “Even if Beijing sets limits on its activities … the PRC’s influence apparatus is very large and at times unwieldy, and individuals that are not under its direct supervision may attempt to influence election activities that they perceive are in line with Beijing’s goals,” the ODNI official said Tuesday, using an acronym for the Chinese government."

Hong Kong CNN — China is a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, NATO leaders said Wednesday, as the defense alliance hardens its stance on Beijing and the “systemic challenges” they say it poses to their countries’ security. The joint declaration marks NATO’s most pointed tone yet on China’s role in a war that has galvanized the 75-year-old bloc, which celebrated its anniversary this week at a three-day leaders’ summit in Washington hosted by US President Joe Biden. China’s “no limits” partnership with Russia and its “large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base” are enabling Moscow to wage its war, the NATO leaders’ statement said, as they urged Beijing to “cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort.” The US and European leaders in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia’s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods. The NATO leaders also elaborated to a greater extent than in the past on concerns over China’s growing capabilities and activities in outer space, and reiterated their previous unease about what they called Beijing’s “malicious cyber and hybrid activities,” including disinformation, and “rapidly” expanding nuclear arsenal. “We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency with the view of safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests,” the statement said, referring to China by the initials of its official name. “At the same time, we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC’s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.” The NATO leaders’ declaration Wednesday comes as the 32-member alliance - historically focused on security in North America and Europe - has in recent years upped its engagement with US allies in Asia and increasingly seen its security as linked to the region, even as member countries have pursued divergent policies toward China. For the third consecutive year, leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea attended the NATO leaders’ summit in another sign of closer ties between the bloc and those countries, as well as Australia.

Sergei Bobylov/Pool/AFP/Getty Images China and Russia’s tightening ties Beijing has deepened political, economic and military ties with Moscow since President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 declared a “no limits” partnership – and their shared opposition to what they said was NATO’s expansion – during the Russian leader’s visit to the Chinese capital, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia’s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its economy, which has been heavily sanctioned in the wake of that invasion, while the two nuclear-armed neighbors have continued to hold joint military exercises. Meanwhile, China has claimed neutrality in the war and sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker, even as the US and European leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is Beijing’s backing of Moscow through its economic and diplomatic support, as well as the provision of dual-use goods.

China’s position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard. We aim to promote peace talks and seek political settlement,” a statement from its mission to the European Union said. The Chinese statement also reiterated Beijing’s position that it has never provided lethal weapons in the conflict and has strict dual-use export controls, defending its trade with Russia as “normal.” The US and European leaders have in recent months raised alarm that such exports are revitalizing Russia’s defense sector and allowing it to survive despite hefty international sanctions. The US has said that dual-use exports have specifically enabled the production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. Both the US and the EU have sanctioned Chinese entities they allege are supporting the war effort. Later Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry also condemned the declaration, with a spokesperson framing NATO as a “great threat” to the world and reiterating Beijing’s claim that the alliance was “fanning the flames” of the war in Ukraine. NATO’s increasing focus on Asia The NATO leaders’ declaration is the latest step in what has been the bloc’s gradual hardening of tone on China in recent years. NATO leaders first mentioned the need to jointly address “opportunities and challenges” posed by China in a 2019 declaration, before moving to refer to “systemic challenges” the country poses in 2021. That shift has come alongside an increased US policy focus on the Indo-Pacific amid a deepening rivalry with Beijing as China under Xi’s leadership has grown increasingly aggressive in the region and in its broader foreign policy. NATO’s attention on Asia has also been accelerated over the past two and a half years by hardening geopolitical fault lines in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin’s tightening relationship with not only China but also North Korea and Iran. NATO leaders on Wednesday also said Pyongyang and Tehran were “fueling” Russia’s war through “direct military support,” and condemned North Korea’s exports of “artillery shells and ballistic missiles” to Russia – which multiple governments say they have tracked since last year when Putin hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Russian Far East.

Beijing has watched warily as NATO’s engagement grows with other powers in the Asia-Pacific. China is widely seen by observers as hoping to be the dominant force in the region and to push back on the US presence there, as Washington bolsters its longstanding Indo-Pacific security partnerships and interests. China and Russia have also converged over their shared opposition to NATO, part of a broader aspiration from both to reshape a world order they see as unfairly dominated by the US, and both have blamed the Western security alliance for provoking Moscow to invade Ukraine. In its statement Thursday, Beijing’s EU mission called on NATO to “correct its wrong perception of China,” and “abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game.” “The Asia-Pacific region is a place for peaceful development, not a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition … NATO should not become the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,” the statement said.

Surveillance cameras where NATO trains Ukrainian troops. Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot. Russia has been engaged in a “bold” sabotage operation across NATO’s member states for more than six months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official. Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf. The NATO official said they had observed “an unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia’s hybrid warfare” over the past six months, which included “physical sabotage” on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. “It is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual delivery,” the senior NATO official said. “It is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate (our) allies.” Warsaw's largest shopping center, Marywilska 44, burns during a massive fire on May 12, 2024. Russia was ""likely"" behind the fire, according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Dariusz Borowicz/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/Reuters Russia has dismissed the claims as unfounded but Russian sabotage and hybrid warfare will be on the agenda of the NATO 75th anniversary meeting in Washington, DC, which began Tuesday. Yet it is unclear how publicly member states will express their outrage at what analysts have called the Kremlin’s new “shadow war,” as they may be reluctant to provide Moscow with a propaganda win, or foment alarm at a series of security breaches across Europe. Recent high-profile arrests have revealed the ad-hoc, clumsy nature of how the Kremlin’s intelligence operations have evolved since the start of the war in Ukraine. Last year, 14 Ukrainians and two Belarusians were arrested in Poland in one case on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence. A Ukrainian, who under Polish privacy law can be identified only as Maxim L., 24, was sentenced to six years after weeks of receiving tasks from a Russian handler, Andrzej, whom he had never physically met but encountered on the Telegram messaging app in February 2023. Andrzej at first paid him $7 in digital currencies for spraying anti-war graffiti around Poland, Maxim said. Yet the tasks soon became darker.

CNN has blurred his face in line with Polish law. Jaroslaw Gorny/Imago ‘Easy money… it seemed so insignificant’ In a rare interview with CNN inside the maximum-security wing of Lublin prison, Maxim said he had fled Ukraine to Poland in a frustrated bid to escape unemployment and poverty. “It was easy money,” he said of the work Andrzej offered. “I needed money badly.” He said he did not feel an obligation to fight for Ukraine after the Russian invasion in February 2022. “That country has never done anything for me,” he said. “I don’t believe that just because you are born in a certain country, you have to go to war for it. Don’t get me wrong: I am not pro-Russian, I am not pro-Ukraine. I am not pro-anything.” Andrzej soon started sending Maxim location pins where he should plant surveillance cameras along the railway tracks near the border town of Medyka, through which military and humanitarian aid would flow to Ukraine. “I didn’t think any of it could cause any actual harm. It seemed so insignificant,” he said. Andrzej later asked him to burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company in the eastern Polish town of Biala Podlaska, he said, which Maxim says he faked, taking a photograph of the fence with lumps of coal he had placed to mimic fire damage.

That was when I decided I’d quit. But I never got a chance. I got arrested the next day.” Polish internal security agents arrested Maxim on March 3, 2023, after weeks of surveillance, sparked partially by the discovery of a gas station receipt Maxim had accidentally dropped on one of his operations, according to a Polish official. Multiple other arrests followed this, making it the largest known Russian espionage operation in Poland of recent times, raising concerns in Warsaw about the extent of Moscow’s infiltration. Two Russian citizens were detained last August on suspicion of recruiting to Wagner and a Polish man and two Belarusians this May for alleged arson. Another Polish man was arrested in April 2024 for possessing ammunition, and surveilling Rzeszow Jasionka airport, a hub for moving NATO arms to Kyiv, in a suspected plot to assassinate Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also frequently uses the facility. The Polish plots join a series of incidents across Europe which, when viewed together, portray the widescale ambition of Moscow’s operations. Russia was “likely” behind an arson attack that hit Poland’s largest shopping center in May, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, and suspicions have been voiced about another fire at an ammunition factory, south of the capital, in June. Czech officials have voiced concerns at Russian involvement in the hacking and disruption of its railways last year.

While the incidents have not all been definitively linked to Russian intelligence, they have been unified by the apparent involvement of amateurs, or petty criminality aimed at spreading fear or disruption. A ‘pretty dangerous game’ The senior NATO official said Russian sabotage on NATO states amounted to a “pretty dangerous game, if (Russia believes) these things are always below the threshold of armed conflict,” that would not trigger the NATO Article 5 stipulation that an attack on one member state is an attack on the entire alliance. “Finding where that line is, is a difficult and dangerous calculation to make,” the official said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s beleaguered invasion of Ukraine shows the Kremlin head was not always getting good military advice. Russia is using the “full gamut” of hybrid operations, the official added. “We see everything from high-end operations in Europe, where we have seen as much as 400,000 euros ($433,000) paid for some type of intelligence activity, to some places where thugs are being hired for a couple of thousand euros.” CNN's Nick Paton Walsh shows how a Ukrainian drone team works tirelessly to send explosive payloads into Russian territory.

The incident was a high-profile peak in what Estonian officials have said is a years-long campaign by Moscow to destabilize its tiny NATO neighbor, about a fifth of whose population of 1.3 million is Russian-speaking, according to a 2021 analysis by the EU. Recent months have seen GPS jamming impede civilian aircraft landings, and even the buoys that demark part of Russia’s border with Estonia disappear, amid a short-lived call from Moscow for the maritime frontiers to be reassessed. Harrys Puusepp, a spokesman for the KAPO, Estonia’s internal security service, told CNN that Russian activities had escalated over recent months. “We saw a significant rise in their activity in the last autumn, and by winter, we were able to apprehend more than 10 (suspects). The number has grown by now – persons who were involved in their hybrid activities against Estonian security – in a kind that we hadn’t seen before.” He said the operations were moving “towards physical attacks” and suggested the war in Ukraine might lead to more aggressive Russian tactics in the months ahead, if operatives were redeployed to the Baltic areas from the war. “We have to face the facts. Russia is big enough to have resources to fight a war against Ukraine and also maintain its security operations against European countries… against us. There are people who take part in the war against Ukraine, and then they are rotated to some other region or area. They have more experience. Their mindset is more violent. They are perhaps not so patient anymore trying to get results.”"

The leaders did not provide a specific timeline for Ukraine to join the defensive alliance. Instead, they said they would “be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree, and conditions are met.” “We welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms,” the leaders said in the Washington Summit Declaration, released after a meeting of NATO’s North Atlantic Council Wednesday. “As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,” the declaration said. The declaration outlined the alliance’s ongoing support for Kyiv, including previous announcements on new air defense systems and the establishment of the “NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners.” The description of Ukraine’s path as “irreversible” comes after months of diplomatic negotiations in the lead up to the Washington Summit and was a point of contention among the allies. Prior to the release of the declaration, some diplomats had argued that it was not enough to just describe the path as “irreversible,” but that there must be strong support undergirding that description. Moving the training and equipment coordination under the auspices of NATO has been seen by many as a way to ensure ongoing support for Kyiv in the case of the reelection of former US President Donald Trump. Officials have quietly expressed concerns about what a second Trump presidency could mean for the defensive alliance and for the military support for Kyiv as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues with little sign of a military or diplomatic conclusion. There is “a growing and understandable doubt about the future of Western support” for Ukraine, a European diplomat said last week. The aim of the NSATU “is to place security assistance to Ukraine on an enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable, and coherent support,” the declaration said, noting that it “will not, under international law, make NATO a party to the conflict.” “It will support the transformation of Ukraine’s defence and security forces, enabling its further integration with NATO,” the declaration said. The leaders also announced “a pledge of long-term support” to Ukraine, with the intention  “to provide a minimum baseline funding of €40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail.” The declaration also expressed “profound concern” over the “deepening strategic partnership” between China and Russia “and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order.” The declaration calls Beijing “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine through its so-called ‘no limits’ partnership and its large-scale support for Russia’s defence industrial base,” and calls on China, “as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort.” It noted that China “cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,” echoing the growing public concern from the US and European allies about Beijing’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. The declaration also said China “continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security” through “sustained malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation.” It recognized the Indo-Pacific as “important for NATO,” but did not suggest a strong role for the alliance in this area. “We welcome the continued contributions of our Asia-Pacific partners to Euro-Atlantic security,” it said. “We are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defence, countering disinformation, and technology.”"

Russia has repeatedly denied targeting the hospital in Kyiv and alleged, without evidence, that a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile caused the blast. But a UN human rights official said evidence suggested Moscow’s forces were responsible for the deadly strike. “Analysis of the video footage and assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children’s hospital suffered a direct hit rather than receiving damages due to an intercepted weapons system,” Danielle Bell, head of the UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told reporters Tuesday. Bell said the attack damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards at Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital , which has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country, adding that Ukrainian officials have since transferred 600 children to other hospitals. “This terrible attack shows that nowhere is safe in Ukraine,” Bell added. The UN assessment tallies with weapons experts, who told CNN that it was highly likely a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile struck the children’s hospital in Kyiv on Monday. Reviewing video footage that CNN had verified and geolocated and images of fragments from the scene, weapons experts said that evidence strongly suggests the hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile as opposed to a Ukrainian air defense projectile. Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CNN Wednesday that the flight profile in the footage of the missile hitting the hospital is “exactly correct for the Kh-101, with the right dive angle, under power and not tumbling or falling like a spent air-defence missile might.” The silhouette of the rocket visible in the footage also matches the Kh-101, Bronk said. Two adults were killed in the strike and 16 others - including seven children - were injured, according to Ukrainian officials, as Russia launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people in total.

The Russian attacks came as NATO leaders gathered in Washington, where the United States and NATO allies agreed to give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen Kyiv’s air defenses, members of the defense alliance said in a joint statement on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden also announced plans to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit – providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia’s invasion. During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that “the United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.” ‘Targeted attack by Russia’ Images and video from the aftermath of the strike on the Kyiv hospital show children with cancer being treated outside the facility and an injured toddler with blood on his face and arms. A CNN team at the site on Tuesday said the level of destruction there showed how forceful the explosion must have been. A pile of debris could be seen in place of where part of the facility once stood, while underneath a section of flooring lay the remnants of a car that was completely flattened when the building came crashing down. The UN’s monitoring mission said it was likely that a KH-101 cruise missile launched by Russia struck the children’s hospital. It made the determination “based on video footage, which shows the technical specification of the type of weapon that was used” and that such footage “shows the weapon directly impacting the hospital rather than being intercepted in the air,” Bell said.

All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded.” But the US also blamed Russia for the hospital strike. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UNSC meeting that the Russian “attack makes abundantly clear: Putin is not interested in peace.” Kyiv described the strike as a “targeted attack by Russia,” with the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) saying a Russian long-range cruise missile struck the facility. “Relevant evidence has already been found at the scene of the tragedy: in particular, fragments of the rear part of the Kh-101 missile with a serial number and part of the steering wheel of the same missile,” the SBU said. SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk vowed the agency would respond to what he said were Russian war crimes. “This retribution will be both legal and moral,” he said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi “strongly raised the issue of early discharge” to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his two-day trip to Moscow this week, stressing the need to bring all Indians home “as early as possible,” Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters in a news briefing. “The Russian side promised the early discharge of all Indian nationals from the service of the Russian army,” he said. Moscow has not commented on the agreement, but New Delhi has been pushing for the release of its nationals from the Russian army for months, telling CNN in April that it was a “top priority.” The Indian Ministry of External Affairs previously told CNN it has been in continuous contact with Russian authorities to secure their release. By some estimates, Russia has been sending thousands of foreign men to fight in Ukraine since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of its southwestern neighbor in February 2022. Many of them are young men from South Asia, enticed by the prospect of steady employment and higher salaries in Russia. In Nepal, prominent opposition lawmaker and former foreign minister Bimala Rai Paudyal told parliament earlier this year that between 14,000 and 15,000 Nepalis were fighting on the front lines , citing testimony from men returning from Ukraine.

In early March, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it had busted major human trafficking networks that were duping men into Russian military jobs, with 35 such cases identified. “The trafficked Indian Nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in Russia-Ukraine War Zone against their wishes,” the CBI statement said. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Kwatra said he does know the precise number of Indians recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine, but anticipates it is between 35 and 50 people. Of those, 10 Indian nationals have already returned to India, he said. “Now, the two sides will work on it and see how expeditiously we can get them back into the country,” Kwatra said. India has no law preventing its citizens from serving in a foreign state’s military. One family from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad recently told CNN they spent two months trying to find out what happened to their brother after he traveled to Russia on the promise of job opportunities. Imran Mohammad said an employment agency had enticed his brother Asfan Mohammed with an offer for helper and security jobs in the Russian army, saying he could get a Russian passport and national card within a year. Instead, Asfan was sent to the battlefield in Ukraine and was killed in combat. “These brokers duped the boys and put their lives in danger,” Imran said, referring to Asfan and other Indians sent to war. 10-	Ramchandra Khadka praying outside a temple in Kathmandu for his comrades fighting for Russia (Source: CNN) CNN Related article Russia has recruited as many as 15,000 Nepalis to fight its war.

Several returned Nepali fighters who spoke with CNN earlier this year blamed Russia for using them as cannon fodder in the war. “It’s the Nepalis and other foreign fighters that are actually fighting in the front of war zones. The Russians position themselves a few hundred meters back as support,” said Suman Tamang, after he returned from Russia. The Nepalis who fought for Russia said they had received only brief training before being sent into combat. Ramchandra Khadka, who returned to Nepal after suffering injuries in Ukraine, told CNN that after only two weeks of training, he was sent to the front lines in Bakhmut – a town in eastern Ukraine that saw some of the heaviest fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces – with a gun and a basic kit. “I didn’t join the Russian military for pleasure. I didn’t have any job opportunities in Nepal. But in hindsight, it wasn’t the right decision,” Khadka said. “We didn’t realize we would be sent to the front lines that quickly and how horrible the situation would be.” CNN’s Brad Lendon, Vedika Sud, Sugam Pokharel, Matthew Chance, Mihir Melwani, and journalist Nishant Khanal contributed reporting."

To this end, we must be strong and uncompromising altogether,” Zelensky said. “And first of all, America, and first of all, the leaders of America, and the president of the United States as a leader of the free world, to be uncompromising in defending democracy. Uncompromising against Putin and his country. Uncompromising to every possible terror.” Zelensky’s remarks at the Ronald Reagan Institute in Washington come on the sidelines of the summit, which has placed providing long-term support for Ukraine in the war against Russia at the top of the agenda. In the coming days, the Ukrainian leader will seek to shore up and boost allied support for his country and meet with President Joe Biden. Zelensky urged America to provide more “answers” to Ukraine and other allies bordering Russia, saying, “We have proven more than once that the more we have, the harder it is for Putin to make war. He still thinks that war might pay. He still thinks that humiliating America might pay.” Ukraine, he said, “can significantly limit Russian actions in south Ukraine and push the occupiers out of there if the American leadership assists us with the necessary deep strike capabilities against Russian military and logistics in our Ukrainian Crimea.” The US has promised “significant” announcements on Ukraine during the three-day global gathering, which Biden kicked off earlier in the evening with remarks announcing plans to supply new air defenses to the country . Ahead of the summit, NATO members made clear that Ukraine would be the main focus. “The priority one, two, and three is Ukraine,” a European diplomat said. However, there are looming questions whether the shows of support will be enough as the war drags on with little sign of a quick diplomatic or military victory for Kyiv. Concerns about the future of NATO should Trump win November’s presidential election are weighing on many attendees who were not reassured by Biden’s disastrous debate performance late last month. “I hope that if people of America vote for President Trump, I hope his policy with Ukraine will not change,” Zelensky said during an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier Tuesday night, adding that he doesn’t know the former president “very well” but that the two had “good meetings” during the Trump administration. Visit follows deadly Russian attacks Zelensky touched down in the US capital on Monday evening in the shadow of deadly Russian attacks on cities throughout Ukraine earlier that day. The barrage of missiles hit buildings across the country, including Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital , and killed more than three dozen people. In reference Russian officials’ claims that the Kremlin was not behind the attack, Zelensky said in his remarks, “Russia always knows where its missiles hit. Always.” On Tuesday evening, the US and some of its NATO allies announced they will give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen Kyiv’s air defenses against ongoing Russian aerial barrages. The US, Germany and Romania will each provide a Patriot battery of their own, while the Netherlands will work with other countries to enable an additional Patriot battery, according to a joint statement. Meanwhile, Italy would also provide a SAMP-T long-range air defense system. “This is yet another significant step following the US decision to prioritize Ukraine in air defense missile deliveries,” Zelensky wrote on X following the announcement. “I am grateful to President Biden for his leadership and to all partner countries for their commitment to providing us with air defense capabilities as quickly as possible. “Russia’s air terror against Ukrainians, including yesterday’s brutal strike on the children’s hospital, must be met with unity and strength, with resolute and bold decisions. And that is precisely what such decisions ensure,” he wrote. Officials said the timing of Moscow’s assault – a day before the start of the summit – was calculated. It was “a hello from Putin to all the NATO countries … making fun of us trying to follow red lines,” as Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of Ukraine’s parliament, said. They also said the attack underscored the need for continued military support for Ukraine – and the ability to use those weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. “This attack, this attack on Ukraine’s future – because children are our future – shall not remain unresponded,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in remarks alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday. “I am looking forward to our discussion on how we can further strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities.” “We want the lifting of any sort of limitations on the weapons Ukraine is receiving,” Stefanchuk said at an event in Washington on Monday. The Biden administration recently shifted its policy to allow US weapons to be used in strikes into Russian territory where Russian forces are engaging in cross-border attacks into Ukraine. However, Ukrainian officials want to see that policy expanded further to allow strikes against Russian military targets anywhere in Russian territory. Stefanchuk on Monday called for “a stable and forecastable supply of these weapons,” ammunition and to be able to “effectively counter the threats from the skies,” meaning F-16 fighter jets. “We don’t want to wait for another sanctions package like an iPhone package,” he said, noting they just need one kind of sanctions: ones that “will make Russia feel the economic pain for this war.” In remarks when he arrived in the US capital, Zelensky said Kyiv will fight for “decisive actions” from the United States and Europe at the summit Ukraine seeks NATO membership Ukraine also wants clear progress toward membership in NATO. The matter caused a diplomatic spat last year ahead of the summit in Vilnius, with Zelensky fuming that it was “unprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine’s membership” to NATO. This year, officials said there has been far greater communication with the Ukrainians in the lead up to the summit. The European diplomat said there have been “deep and frank conversations” with Ukrainian officials. Presidential adviser Andriy Yermak was in Washington last week in part to work on commitments ahead of the summit. As CNN reported Monday, Ukraine’s path to NATO was described as “irreversible” in a draft text of the alliance’s joint communique, according to three sources familiar. Still, some say that there must be a stronger commitment to Ukraine. A senior European diplomat quipped that “this irreversibility is very much reversible.” A senior Biden administration official said Friday that what they “described in terms of the bridge to membership and the deliverables that NATO will be unveiling for Ukraine is quite substantial.” “We’re not talking about some sort of plan for how they’re going to get from here to there. We’re talking about standing up an entire command at Wiesbaden and we’ll look at how we do these various pieces that I mentioned earlier – training, coordination, equipping, coordination, logistics, force development. This is a very serious effort to get Ukraine in a position, as I said earlier, where it will be ready to assume its roles and responsibilities within the alliance on day one,” the official said. “I’ll let the Ukrainians speak for themselves, but I think they understand the value of what NATO will be doing for that,” they said.

The US, Germany, and Romania will each provide a Patriot battery of their own, while the Netherlands will work with other countries to enable an additional Patriot battery, each country announced in a joint statement. Meanwhile, Italy would also provide a SAMP-T long-range air defense system. The statement said the air-defense systems “will help to protect Ukrainian cities, civilians, and soldiers, and we are coordinating with the Ukrainian government so that these systems can be utilized rapidly.” During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that “the United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.” “They will get this assistance before anyone else gets it,” Biden added. Watch Biden’s full remarks here: Biden gives closely watched speech at NATO summit Israel also receives defensive interceptors from the United States, though the country relies far more on its Iron Dome to intercept drones and rockets. The US had previously discussed sending Patriot interceptors in Israel to Ukraine. In addition to the long-range aerial defense systems, the US and other countries are also providing Ukraine with “dozens” of short- and medium-range systems to help Kyiv intercept Russian drones and missiles. The systems including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard systems. Canada, Norway, Spain, the UK and other countries will “play an integral role” in providing the systems to Ukraine, while “many other supporters” will provide the interceptor missiles, the statement said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would fight for “decisive actions” from the United States and Europe to help Ukraine. “It is not only our country that needs it – everyone needs it, literally every partner, all nations,” Zelensky said in his first remarks after arriving in the US. The Ukrainian president said he would ask for more air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, and additional security guarantees, “including weapons and finances, political support.” One day before Biden’s announcement, Russian strikes across Ukraine killed at least 22 people and injured 68 more, according to Ukrainian officials, including a strike on the country’s largest children’s hospital. On Monday evening, Biden called the strikes a “horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality.” Two-and-a-half years into the war with Russia, Zelensky has repeatedly asked allied nations to strengthen his country’s air defenses to thwart Moscow’s military prowess overhead. The United States has been a crucial ally to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in 2022 – but the future of that alliance has been thrown into question. Former President Donald Trump has said he would pressure Ukraine into a peace deal with Russia that would see Kyiv cede territory in the process if he wins the presidency. Earlier this year, Trump said he would allow Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” with countries that don’t meet NATO defense-funding obligations. Support for Ukraine was also a prime topic at this year’s G7 summit in Italy, where Biden and Zelensky signed an agreement that commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. But that agreement could be undone under a different administration. Biden spoke Tuesday from the Mellon Auditorium, where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949 – creating the alliance – and where former President Bill Clinton held the alliance’s 50th anniversary summit. Given the backdrop, Biden leaned into the history of the alliance and the trajectory of the threats it has faced – and argued that, under his leadership, NATO has become stronger than ever. “All we allies knew before this war Putin thought NATO would break,” Biden said. “Today, NATO is stronger than its ever been in its history.” He concluded his speech by presenting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Video Ad Feedback Watch the moment Biden awarded NATO secretary general a major honor 03:46 - Source: CNN Biden’s remarks were scripted and read from a teleprompter, but the stakes were high for the president as many members of his own party and the public writ large are watching him closely following his poor debate performance late last month. Some members of his own party have recently said they want more evidence of his mental and physical fitness before deciding whether to back him for four more years. Biden largely got through his speech without any major hiccups, though he did appear to accidentally read stage instructions from his prepared remarks while presenting the medal to Stoltenberg. Though foreign diplomats were horrified by Biden’s debate performance, the president has several more chances to prove himself this week – including during a solo press conference on Thursday.

CNN — A year ago, NATO heads of state gathered in Vilnius, Lithuania, for their annual summit. A gathering designed to send Russian President Vladimir Putin a message about NATO’s resolve and commitment became clouded instead, however, by the question of Ukraine’s eventual membership in the alliance. Daniel R. DePetris Courtesy Daniel R. DePetris The communique released after the multi-day event reaffirmed a commitment given by the alliance during the 2008 summit in Bucharest: Ukraine will become a NATO member, even if the timing is yet to be determined. For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the reaffirmation was far short of his expectations . He called NATO’s unwillingness to establish a concrete timeframe for Ukraine’s membership “ unprecedented and absurd ,” causing consternation in the Biden administration and nearly derailing the summit . Washington and Kyiv were able to patch up the acrimony. But with NATO leaders in Washington this week to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the alliance, the Ukraine membership question continues to hover over the proceedings like humidity in the dog days of August.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Related article Biden to open NATO summit by announcing new air defenses for Ukraine The United States and its allies will no doubt continue to insist ad nauseam that it’s only a matter of time before Ukraine is given the privilege of joining NATO. Indeed, according to the draft communique for this week’s summit, NATO is preparing to emphasize that Ukraine’s path to joining the allliance is “irreversible,” — a declaration first made by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in April . In reality, however, Ukraine is nowhere near membership. NATO doesn’t look prepared to bring Ukraine into the alliance, and there’s a good case to be made that bestowing membership status on Kyiv would be bad policy. It’s long past time for the Biden administration to stop pretending otherwise. The White House should give Zelensky the honesty he deserves. First, the US should be clear up front about how difficult it is for an aspiring country to become a member of NATO. Its charter makes clear that member nations agree to defend any other member of the alliance that comes under attack: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.” On paper, Poland is as obligated to come to the defense of the US as the US is obligated to come to the defense of Poland. Several key NATO members, however, haven’t been especially eager to come to the defense of Ukraine. In 2008, when then-President George W. Bush wanted to offer Ukraine (and Georgia, another former Soviet state) a plan to get the accession process started, allies like France and Germany were opposed to it .

David Ake/Getty Images Related article Opinion: As NATO leaders meet in Washington, 5,000 miles away desperation sets in After the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014 put the issue on the agenda once again, it was the US that had qualms. Then-President Barack Obama instead said that Washington would call a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission , a body to nurture the bilateral relationship. Biden stated as recently as last month that he is “not prepared to support the NATO-ization of Ukraine.” Because NATO makes decisions through consensus , any single member can block Ukraine’s accession. The notion that Kyiv will enter NATO as long as the war in Ukraine is churning is of course fanciful for the simple reason that the members of the alliance would then be compelled to fight Russia directly, which raises the question of whether bringing Ukraine into NATO, even if feasible, is actually wise. Zelensky, who has spent a great deal of time since Russia’s invasion trying to press the subject of membership, himself understands this necessary delay quite well . Some foreign policy scholars, like former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, have recommended extending a NATO invitation to Ukraine to pave the way for when the war is over. This would presumably deter Putin over the long-term and prevent Moscow from using any ceasefire to rebuild its military for another invasion of Ukraine months or years down the line.

Why would Putin consider a ceasefire or diplomatic settlement with Kyiv if he knew that NATO membership for Ukraine was just around the corner? Far from promoting a settlement, this idea could make the war’s termination virtually impossible for Putin, who explicitly called on Ukraine to drop its aspirations to join NATO as a core condition of any peace negotiation. As dozens of foreign policy experts wrote in an open letter last week (which I signed), “The closer NATO comes to promising that Ukraine will join the alliance once the war ends, the greater the incentive for Russia to keep fighting the war and killing Ukrainians so as to forestall Ukraine’s integration into NATO.” All that aside, it’s not altogether clear that extending a NATO security guarantee to Ukraine would be fully honored — which could undermine the alliance itself. NATO countries have repeatedly demonstrated that they won’t get into a direct shooting war on Ukraine’s behalf . The West’s justifiable reticence to get involved militarily in Ukraine suggests that when push comes to shove, NATO is not going to plunge itself into a war with the world’s largest nuclear power. A NATO security guarantee without credibility is merely a paper promise, one which Russia might choose to test. NATO would then be presented with two unpalatable options: stand idly by and erode the power of its collective defense clause or wage an unwanted war against a country with more than 5,500 nuclear warheads .

The US exposes itself as a superpower giving a prospective client state false hope. NATO reveals itself to be divided on the Ukraine accession question. And Ukraine is forced to endure the humiliation of being strung along, like a proverbial hamster on a wheel that can’t reach the hunk of cheese in front of it. The best Ukraine is likely to get from NATO is more air defense batteries and missiles, a stronger training program for its troops and a commitment to help Kyiv hold the line. Biden should tell Zelensky point-blank that NATO membership is a fool’s errand — and while he’s at it, he ought to apologize to all Ukrainians, for waiting so long to state the obvious."

Moscow launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people, according to the latest figures released by authorities on Tuesday. Search and rescue operations continued into Tuesday after the large-scale bombardment struck the capital, as well as in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. The death toll includes 33 people in Kyiv, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said in an update Tuesday. Earlier, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said four children were among the dead after a boy’s body was found under the rubble in the capital’s Shevchenkivskyi district. Two people were killed and at least 16 others injured in the strike on Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital . The facility is Ukraine’s largest children’s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Every year, around 7,000 surgeries – including treatments for cancer and hematological diseases – are conducted at the hospital, according to Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Footage from the children’s hospital showed volunteers working with police and security services to sift through the rubble as smoke billowed from the facility, as staff described how they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Two floors of the hospital were demolished, comprising an area of 400 square meters (4,300 sq. ft.), the emergency service said, while Ukraine’s health minister Viktor Liashko said intensive care units, oncology departments and surgery units had been damaged. “Now we have evacuated all the children. Those who came for routine treatment have gone home, consulted with their doctors, and will decide where they will continue their treatment,” he told CNN Tuesday. “The rest of the children who were on oxygen support and connected to life support devices are now in hospitals and are being provided with adequate medical care.” In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hold an informal meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence, outside Moscow, on July 8, 2024.

It came a day before US President Joe Biden was set to host a crucial NATO Summit in Washington, where announcements over the alliance’s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called the strikes a “horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality.” “It is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,” Biden said, noting that he would meet with Volodymyr Zelensky during the summit “to make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable.” Meanwhile, seven people were killed in a Russian attack Monday on a private medical facility in Kyiv belonging to the Adonis network, the company said. Of those killed, five were staff members and two were patients, Adonis said. Russia’s defense ministry on Monday claimed that Moscow had struck “military industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces” using long-range, high-precision weapons. At a special meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday called to discuss the Russian strike, Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia denied targeting the children’s hospital. “We have not bombed the children’s hospital,” Nebenzia said when responding to an accusation that Russia committed a war crime for allegedly striking the hospital.

Gleb Garanich/Reuters Eyewitnesses recount hospital strike Eyewitnesses recalled scenes of chaos moments after the Russian missile slammed into the children’s hospital. Ophthalmologist Lesya Lysytsia told CNN: “You see the light, then the sound, then everything falls down and then over the next several seconds you think, ‘are you still alive or is it the end and what to do? Where are the patients? How are the patients? How are the children?’” Natalia Sardudinova, a senior nurse, described the strike as “scary,” when “windows were crunching.” She told CNN that two children were in operating theaters at the time of the blast, and they were relocated to a shelter in the basement once their procedures were completed. “Everything was in smoke, there was no air to breathe. The doctor was cut by shrapnel. The windows and doors were blown out. One nurse in the hospital was heavily injured,” Sardudinova added. “My hands are still shaking. They don’t let anyone in now, they are afraid it will collapse.” Yulia Vasylenko, the mother of an 11-year-old cancer patient at the hospital, said her son Denys was evacuated outside following the strike. “My son is on painkillers. He has cancer. He has been without medication for half a day. He was brought down the stairs from the third floor. There was smoke (and) heavy dust,” she said. Iryna Filimonova, a senior nurse at the pediatric urology department, told CNN an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. “The lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,” Filimonova said. “The baby was brought down (to the shelter)… Some of my nursing colleagues who worked in the operating theaters and some doctors were cut by glass fragments. Our department was destroyed.” A picture shared by President Zelensky on his official X page showing a young patient injured in the strike. ZelenskyyUa/X Another operating theater nurse, Oksana Mosiychuk, said one medical team tried to extinguish a blaze that broke out in their department, including an operating table which had caught fire. Air raid sirens continued to ring out over Kyiv in the aftermath, with CNN video showing people who had been evacuated pushing children on stretchers to safety. Scores of volunteers later dropped off much-needed supplies and donations – including water, food, medicine and diapers – to the hospital. A UN team who visited the site later saw children “receiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,” the UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. In the hospital’s newer building, 12 departments were damaged, and a section of Ukraine’s only oncology and hematology laboratory was completely destroyed, according to the Kyiv military administration. Immediately after the strike, patients, their families and medical staff were evacuated out of the hospital buildings. DmytroKuleba/X UN holds special meeting Zelensky had called for an emergency assembly of the UN Security Council after the strike while vowing retaliation over the attacks. At the special meeting Tuesday, Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador, alleged, without any proof, that a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile is what struck the hospital. “If this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded,” Nebenzia said.

Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov, appealed for more air defense systems to support the war-torn country. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the West to provide it with more air defense systems to better protect its cities. Last month, he praised Biden for prioritizing a delivery after the two presidents signed a security agreement . Ukraine’s prosecutor general sent evidence of Monday’s Russian attacks to the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday. It came as several European nations denounced the shelling, with France urging for the attack to “be added to the list of war crimes for which Russia will be held to account.” Germany and Slovakia have agreed to take in children from Ukraine for treatment. German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a rescue flight will leave on Wednesday, according to a post from the German embassy in London on X. Meanwhile, the Czech foreign minister said he summoned the Russian ambassador in Prague over the attack on the hospital. Monday’s attack is the tragic but all too familiar reality for many of Ukraine’s civilians over the past two and a half years since Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Since February 2022, the conflict has claimed the lives of 11,126 people and injured 21,863 others, according to data in May from the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Additionally, the heavy fighting has caused an estimated 3.7 million people to be driven from their homes and internally displaced while nearly 6.5 million people have fled to neighboring countries, the UNHCR has said. According to the World Health Organization, there have been more than 1,600 instances of heavy weapons attacks impacting medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 141 people killed in these attacks. Health minister Liashko told CNN on Tuesday that of the impacted facilities, “more than 250 have been completely destroyed and cannot be restored. Only new ones can be built.” Last December, 12 pregnant women and four newborn babies had a fortunate escape from a maternity hospital in Dnipro that had been extensively damaged in an airstrike. Previously, the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital in Mariupol less than a month after Russian troops flooded across the border sparked international condemnation.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow on Monday, while less than 600 miles away Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities in a morning rush hour assault that killed at least 39 people. Modi’s two-day trip marks his first visit to Russia since Putin began his full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two and a half years ago, with images and video Monday showing the two leaders hugging, chatting over tea, riding in an electric vehicle and watching a horse show. “It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,” Zelensky said in a post on X on Monday, referring to the deadly Russian attacks. Modi did not address the strikes directly during a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday though he did say solutions to conflict are unlikely to come through war, but rather peace and dialogue. “Whether it’s conflict war or terror, any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die,” Modi told reporters while seated alongside the Russian president, appearing to deliver his most critical comments to date against Russia’s war in Ukraine. “As a friend, I have always said that peace is necessary for the prosperity of future generations, but I also know that on the battlefield, solutions aren’t easy to come by between guns, bombs and bullets. We have to adopt a path to peace through dialogue,” Modi said. The Indian prime minister said the “world is watching this current visit and interpreting it in various ways.” He added: “India is ready to support you in every possible way to achieve peace. I assure you and the world that we are in favor of peace and, after talking to my friend Putin yesterday, I have hope.” Modi said the two leaders had discussed Ukraine when he made a five-hour visit to Putin’s Novo-Ogaryovo residence late Monday. Putin also confirmed to reporters Tuesday that the pair had discussed Ukraine, thanking Modi for his attempts to find a solution to the conflict.

He also announced the opening of two new consulates in the Russian cities of Yekaterinburg and Kazan to “facilitate travel and business.” “No matter if the temperatures in Russia are in minus, Russia-India friendship has always been in plus,” he said. “This is a relationship built on a foundation of mutual trust and mutual respect.” The large-scale daylight bombardment struck the capital Kyiv, and cities including Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk – some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. In Kyiv, 29 people were killed, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko on Tuesday. Two people were killed and at least 16 others were injured in the strike on Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital . The facility is Ukraine’s largest children’s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Videos from the scene showed volunteers working with police and security services to dig through the rubble as smoke billowed from the hospital. Search and rescue operations for people potentially trapped beneath the debris continued on Tuesday.

Two children had been in the operating theaters at the time of the blast, and both were relocated to the basement shelter once their procedures were completed, a senior nurse told CNN. Another senior nurse said an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. “The lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,” Iryna Filimonova said. “The baby was brought down (to the shelter). I immediately ran to help clear the rubble.” United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said the blast forced medical workers to treat sick children outside the facility. Patients were “receiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,” he said in a statement. Russia’s defense ministry on Monday claimed that its forces struck “military industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces,” with long-range, high-precision weapons. Without providing evidence, the Russian ministry also claimed that photos and videos from the hospital blast confirmed the damage was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. Modi’s Russia visit Meanwhile, in the Russian capital on Tuesday, Putin and Modi held official talks at the Kremlin. Earlier in the day, they visited an exhibition center hosting a pavilion on the nuclear industry, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Putin had welcomed the Indian leader to his Novo-Ogaryovo residence late Monday, where the Russian president greeted him as a “dear friend” and said he was “very happy” to see him, TASS reported. Modi thanked Putin for hosting him at his suburban property, saying in a post on X: “Looking forward to our talks tomorrow as well, which will surely go a long way in further cementing the bonds of friendship between India and Russia.” The trip is a sign that New Delhi and Moscow remain close despite Russia’s deepening dependence on China and is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India has longstanding ties to Moscow and remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment. It has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin’s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West.

We seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.” The United States has raised concerns with India about its relationship with Russia, a US State Department spokesperson told reporters in a media briefing Monday. “I will look to Prime Minister Modi’s public remarks to see what he talked about, but as I said, we made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia,” spokesperson Matthew Miller said. “We would hope India and any other country, when they engage with Russia, would make clear that Russia should respect the UN Charter, should respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” While India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia’s invasion.

Biden called Russian missile strikes in Kyiv – including on the children’s hospital – a “horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality,” in a statement Monday evening. “It is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,” Biden said.

During his two-day visit, Modi is expected to attend a private dinner hosted by Vladimir Putin and hold talks with the Russian president, according to India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. The summit will “provide an opportunity to the two leaders to review the whole range of bilateral issues,” Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi last week, adding that Modi and Putin will “also share perspectives on regional and global developments of mutual interest.” India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin’s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West.

Modi last met with Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO meeting in Uzbekistan, when he told the Russian leader: “Now is not the time for war.” But while India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia’s invasion.

They greeted each other with a hug, chatted over tea and rode around in an electric vehicle. Putin also showed Modi the stables and they watched a horse show. The trip is Modi’s first bilateral visit since winning a third consecutive term in a massive general election last month and is seen as a rare break in convention for an Indian leader who typically travels to neighboring countries such as Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The visit also comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing, which has simmered in recent years. Modi’s trip follows Putin’s return from Kazakhstan, where the Russian leader last week attended the annual leaders’ meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia, at which he claimed Moscow-Beijing relations were experiencing “the best period in their history.” For India, that burgeoning relationship is “a matter of deep concern,” said Nandan Unnikrishnan, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “That is one of the reasons that Mr. Modi is undertaking this trip because traditionally, the Soviet Union and then subsequently Russia, has been a balancer in our relationship with China, which has been not the best since the late ’50s of the last century,” he said.

Modi’s visit to Russia is also widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. Despite undermining Western sanctions by purchasing large quantities of Russian oil, New Delhi has remained close with the United States, a key partner as both countries share concerns over China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders’ summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine. Following his Russia trip, Modi will visit Austria in the Indian leader’s first visit to the European nation, according to his office. CNN’s Ivan Watson contributed reporting."

How strong of a guarantee to provide to Ukraine about its future membership to NATO has been a key source of debate between the 32 members of the alliance ahead of this week’s summit in Washington, CNN previously reported. The draft could change before the final version, but the presence of the “irreversible” language would be a significant signal to Kyiv and Moscow as the war in Ukraine continues with little sign of an end. One of the sources, a US official, said the White House supports the use of the word in the final communique as long as the document also reaffirms that Ukraine’s work on democratic reforms must continue. The official said the final version is expected to contain that language. While many Europeans have emphasized the need for strong language around Ukraine’s eventual future in the alliance, US and German officials had proposed describing a “bridge” to NATO membership for Ukraine. However, officials have also stressed the importance of “tangible measures,” in the words of a European diplomat, to support Kyiv’s ongoing fight against Russia. Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of Ukraine’s parliament, said at an event Monday that it’s not just about language, but it’s about actually bringing Ukraine closer to NATO. A US senior administration official said Friday that the alliance will make “significant new announcements about how we’re increasing NATO’s military, political and financial support for Ukraine” as part of Kyiv’s “bridge to NATO.” US officials on Monday publicly declined to discuss specifics of the joint communique ahead of the summit, which kicks off on Tuesday. “There is rightly considerable focus on what Allies will say about Ukraine’s membership path in the summit declaration. The language will be clear and forceful. It will recognize Ukraine’s vital ongoing reform efforts and demonstrate Allied support for Ukraine on its path to NATO membership,” Michael Carpenter, the senior advisor for Europe at the National Security Council, said at a briefing Monday. The senior administration official said Friday that what they “described in terms of the bridge to membership and the deliverables that NATO will be unveiling for Ukraine is quite substantial.” “We’re not talking about some sort of plan for how they’re going to get from here to there. We’re talking about standing up an entire command at Wiesbaden, and we’ll look at how we do these various pieces that I mentioned earlier – training, coordination, equipping, coordination, logistics, force development. This is a very serious effort to get Ukraine in a position, as I said earlier, where it will be ready to assume its roles and responsibilities within the alliance on day one,” the official said. “I’ll let the Ukrainians speak for themselves, but I think they understand the value of what NATO will be doing for that,” they said."

After an impressive 6-2 6-1 win, an emotional Svitolina struggled to get through her on-court interview after the match.

A ruthless Svitolina converted four of her six break point chances and she will now face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina on Wednesday for a place in the semifinals. Rybakina, the No. 4 seed, was involved a hard-fought contest earlier on Wednesday until opponent Anna Kalinskaya had to retire in the second set due to a wrist injury. At least 36 people were killed across Ukraine in Russian attacks on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital has been crucial in supporting some the sickest children from across the country. Two adults were killed and 16 others – including seven children – were injured in the attack, according to Kyiv’s mayor Vitaliy Klytchko Some 137 people were wounded in the attacks which left nearly 100 buildings damaged. Svitolina said being able to continue using her platform at Wimbledon to maintain awareness of the war “really motivated” her during Monday’s win. “It’s [an] incredibly sad day today for all Ukrainians,” Svitolina said in her post-match press conference. “It was really difficult for me to really be here in a way and do anything. I just wanted to be in my room, just be there with my emotions, with everything. “When you have these sad days where you don’t want to do anything, it was this kind of day for me. It’s difficult really to explain, I guess, because of course for us Ukrainians, it’s very close to our heart and [a] very sensitive topic, very sensitive emotions that we feel every single day. “But today was one of the days where it was even more difficult because the missile landed on the hospital, the kids’ hospital.” Svitolina added she had received “so many messages” after her win and said the victory was a “small light that brought a happy moment for Ukrainian people.” Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv and Sugam Pokharel in London contributed to this report."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Odesa CNN — As Washington prepares to welcome world leaders for a landmark summit commemorating 75 years of NATO, some 5,000 miles away I was having a heart wrenching dinner conversation. Michael Bociurkiw Chrystia Chudczak “My dreams have been shattered,” a Ukrainian friend, Inna Ivanova, told me at a restaurant tucked away in an obscure corner of Odesa. A former resident of this southern Ukrainian port city, Inna was visiting family during a break from her job as an accountant in Germany. Up until Russia’s full-scale invasion two years ago, Inna was studying drama with hopes of becoming an actress. But with the frequent air raid sirens and electricity outages, like millions of other Ukrainians, Inna opted for a calmer life elsewhere. Her turmoil, however, continues. This week, 32 NATO allies will be gathering in Washington, DC, amid what they rightly describe as “the most dangerous security environment since the Cold War.” The overarching message from Ukrainians I’ve spoken to over the past few weeks, including Inna, is: “Help us stop this war — now.” And indeed, catapulting Ukraine into a winning position should be the key goal of the Washington summit. Failing to push back Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man who only responds to brute force, will only prolong the war and make it more costly for Europe — especially if many thousands of Ukrainians, unable to heat their homes, seek asylum there this winter. The question on everyone’s lips Looming over the summit will be the question of Ukraine’s desperately sought NATO membership. Former Vice-Prime Minister for the European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told me that if NATO leaders pass up the opportunity to “signal the irreversibility of Ukraine’s membership … it will be a drastic mistake of the alliance.” In this pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik, Russian president-elect Vladimir Putin walks prior to his inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow on May 7, 2024. (Photo by Sergei BOBYLYOV / POOL / AFP) (Photo by SERGEI BOBYLYOV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Sergei Bobylyov/AFP/Getty Images Related article Opinion: Time to call Putin’s bluff She added that it would be a much bigger mistake for the region and the world than the “mismanaged 2008 Bucharest NATO summit decision ,” which opened the door for Ukraine and Georgia to join the alliance, but with no plan on how to get there. (Critics argued it essentially raised a red flag to Moscow regarding two former Soviet countries but without the benefit of NATO protection.) Considering the moves already made by Brussels towards integrating Ukraine and providing it with more predictability, Kyiv could feel that it is pretty much part of the NATO family — save for the collective protection ( known as Article 5 ) that full membership supposedly brings. The Biden administration has talked about the idea of a “bridge” to NATO eventual membership for Ukraine, but the alliance has yet to offer Kyiv a concrete timeline. Nonetheless, NATO leaders could give themselves a pass to skirt the membership question by giving Kyiv drastically enhanced capability to repel Putin’s aggression, while still providing a solid roadmap for a seat at the alliance table. The two faces of Ukraine After more than two years of war, those of us who have stayed recognize newcomers or returnees such as Inna. With each passing air raid siren they anxiously scroll through Telegram channels to assess the threat (cruise missiles and ballistic missiles being the biggest). But a brief stroll would present an Odesa that is opening up, looking less and less like a war zone. The port, the engine which powers the local economy as well as a crucial part of the global food supply chain, is back to pre-war levels of traffic. Visitors this summer will find the landmark Potemkin Stairs and many other prized attractions re-opened after the removal of military blockades. But beneath the surface, the war is still undeniably taking its toll. Fewer men are visible on the streets; caught up in the war or hiding from the roving conscription squads trying to enlist them in it. The morale of soldiers, many of whom have served for more than two years with little time off, is in rough shape, those who visit them regularly, tell me. Military cemeteries in cities such as Lviv are bursting at the seams . And firms are struggling to keep operating amid a severe manpower shortage and power cuts. A smouldering building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa, following a Russian missile strike on June 24. Oleksandr Gimanov/AFP/Getty Images Nationwide, including here in Odesa, attacks on critical infrastructure have been so brutal that much of Ukraine’s generating capacity has been destroyed — leading to outages of several hours a day. Ukrainian-Canadian Bohdan Chomiak, who lives in Kyiv, told me that “roughly speaking, more than half the day is without power.” Some experts are predicting that by the time the first frost arrives later this year, parts of Ukraine could be down to less than four hours a day of power , creating the conditions for a humanitarian catastrophe . To make matters worse, Russia has reportedly started to attack renewable energy installations such as solar and wind farms. What’s next for Ukraine? Let there be no mistake: The last thing Ukrainians want is for any of their countrymen to live a minute more than necessary under brutal Russian occupation. But I’ve seen a noticeable shift in the mood of ordinary people, with many telling me that they can’t take much more of a war that’s claimed the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and at least 174 civilians in May alone . Bitterness is building up too about the drip, drip, drip approach to providing aid to Ukraine. Had Kyiv been given everything it needed at the start of the war, the argument goes, Russia wouldn’t have been able to exploit the delays to seize more territory , build up defen s es and repurpose old missiles to target Ukrainian cities. Ukrainians are also realizing that their traditional alliances with Western capitals may not be so solid after voters turned towards far-right parties in the recent European elections. The agonizing five-month wait for US legislators to approve $61 billion in military and other aid for Kyiv should’ve been a signal for the Zelensky administration that they can also no longer bank on unrestricted American support. Even more so with the prospect of a return of former US President Donald Trump who, in CNN’s presidential debate, made the outrageous claim that he would have the war “settled” before Inauguration Day — doubtfully in Ukraine’s favor. Meanwhile in Washington The forecast ed record heat won’t be the only thing making NATO leaders in Washington break into a sweat. Growing questions over President Joe Biden’s ability to govern , Trump’s strong showing in post-debate polls and the political uncertainty swirling around other alliance leaders in the fallout from the European elections, will make this summit feel more like a painful goodbye gathering than a celebration of NATO unity.

NATO members now look certain to agree to Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg’s proposal to guarantee at least 40 billion euros in military support each year to Ukraine, “for as long as necessary” — an apparent effort to future-proof Ukraine funding from a Trump presidency. Given the high stakes for Ukraine, people here will be watching developments in Washington closely. As one Ukrainian member of parliament, Kira Rudik, leader of the Golos Party, told me: “The best way of honoring Ukraine’s fight for freedom is to allow us to finally win this war.”"

The drone attack took place in a settlement in the Podgorensky district, Voronezh governor Aleksandr Gusev said Sunday. Ukrainian sources said the warehouse was targeted because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. “Several UAVs were detected and destroyed by on-duty air defense forces over the territory of the Voronezh region last night. A fire broke out at a warehouse due to the fall of their wreckage. Detonation of explosive items began in the Podgorensky district,” Gusev said. He did not identify the settlement where the attack took place, but said a state of emergency had been declared there. No one was injured in the attack, but two elderly women were taken to hospital for checks, he said. “Operational services, military and officials are working on the site to eliminate the emergency,” he said, adding arrangements have been made for the evacuation of residents from nearby villages as well. “So far, some 50 people from three settlements have been transported to temporary accommodation centers. We are providing them with all the necessary assistance,” he said.

CNN is not able to independently verify those claims. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a state broadcaster following the attack that “the president has said that we would respond – and I am convinced that you will see it in the foreseeable future.” “They – the United States and NATO – keep on saying that they are not at war with Russia. This is not a brave face on a bad situation, that’s what I’ll say, and they understand it perfectly well,” Lavrov said, according to state news agency TASS. Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Sunday that Ukrainian drone attacks had also been intercepted Saturday night in the border region of Belgorod.

Orban was the first EU leader to visit Moscow since April 2022 and his trip was made even more controversial by the fact that Hungary has just taken over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. Putin and Orban said they discussed ways to end the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Putin said Russia was “always open for discussion” for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict but stressed that he stands by the terms it has already outlined. Those terms would be unacceptable for Ukraine and its western allies. Ukraine has made it clear that any peace deal must include the return of Ukraine’s pre-2014 territory. Orban’s press secretary Zoltan Kovacs said the prime minister’s visit to Moscow was of “special significance,” being the first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Friday’s meeting marks the 14th time the two leaders have met since 2009, he said. Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban met in Moscow on Friday.

He has been campaigning for a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine. “The talks with President Putin at the Kremlin focused on the Ukraine settlement and bilateral relations, emphasizing Hungary’s unique position to communicate with both warring sides,” Kovacs said in a post on X following the meeting on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen criticized Orban’s decision to visit Moscow, saying “appeasement will not stop” Putin. “Only unity and determination will pave the path to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” she added. Kyiv was also quick to criticize Orban’s trip. “The decision to make this trip was made by the Hungarian side without approval or coordination with Ukraine,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Friday. “We remind that the principle of ‘no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine’ remains inviolable for our country and call on all states to strictly adhere to it.” The ministry said Ukraine’s peace formula – the plan outlined by President Volodymyr Zelensky – “remains the only realistic way to restore a just peace.” Orban’s trip to Moscow came just days after his trip to Kyiv on Tuesday, his first visit to Kyiv since Russia’s full-scale war began . He used the trip to urge Zelensky to consider a “ceasefire” in order to “speed up peace talks” with Moscow – something Zelensky firmly rejected."

His lawyers have not been allowed to see him and have been given contradictory information by hospital staff, she added. After arriving at IK-6 from Moscow, Kara-Murza’s lawyers were made to wait for five hours before being told they could not see him, she said. They were later told to come back the next day.

They were told later Friday that they still could not see Kara-Murza, and that the correctional facility would be closed over the weekend, she said. “The lawyers were never able to see Vladimir and make sure that everything was okay with him,” she wrote, saying that Kara-Murza has been suffering from polyneuropathy, “a disease caused by two severe poisonings.” Kara-Murza has claimed he was twice poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok – in 2015 and in 2017 – which caused him to suffer multiple organ failure and fall into a coma. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his illness, but Kara-Murza has long maintained there was “no other possible reason” for it than a politically motivated attack. In an interview with CNN shortly before his arrest in 2022, Kara-Murza criticized the Kremlin for its persecution of its political opponents and invasion of Ukraine. “These people have a literally decades-long track record of going after their political opponents. Poison has been a particularly favored method because it gives them – or at least it did until all of these media investigations came out – plausible deniability,” Kara-Murza told CNN.

And it is important to say it out loud,” he said, adding it was “tragic” that it took the invasion of Ukraine for Western countries to “open their eyes” to the danger of Putin’s regime. He was arrested shortly afterward and later sentenced to 25 years in prison, in a decision condemned as politically motivated and draconian by the international community. Asked by CNN why he had chosen to return to Russia after recovering from his poisoning – and knowing the risks faced by Kremlin critics – he said: “I’m a Russian politician. I have to be in Russia. It’s my home country. I think the biggest gift we could give – those of us who are in opposition to Putin’s regime – to the Kremlin, is to give up and run. I mean, that’s all they want from us.” Since the death of Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in February, Kara-Murza has been the most prominent Russian opposition figure persecuted by the Kremlin. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in poisoning Navalny during a trip to Siberia in August 2020. The investigation found that the FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Navalny for more than three years before poisoning him via his underpants."

Marine Le Pen, figurehead of the French far-right National Rally (RN) party, vowed a prime minister from her party would prevent Kyiv using French-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside Russia and would stymie French President Emmanuel Macron’s suggestion he might put French boots on Ukrainian soil. “If Emmanuel Macron wants to send troops to Ukraine and the prime minister is against it, then there are no troops sent to Ukraine,” she told CNN. “The prime minister has the final say.” Marine Le Pen gave a wide-ranging interview to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday ahead of the second-round vote in France’s snap parliamentary election, called by Macron after National Rally’s stunning European election results in May.

Presenting herself firmly as in the French political mainstream, three-time unsuccessful presidential candidate Le Pen struck a confident, combative figure, days away from perhaps the greatest political victory of her career. With polls pointing towards the National Rally holding the biggest share of the 577 seats in the National Assembly come Monday morning, although potentially not achieving an absolute majority, Macron will likely offer them the chance to choose the country’s next prime minister. Le Pen’s youthful disciple and party leader Jordan Bardella has previously said he will only accept the premiership if National Rally wins by a large enough margin. Even without an RN prime minister, any legislative action in the French parliament will have to navigate around a far-right center of gravity. If there is an RN premiership, it would set up a tense “cohabitation” with Macron’s centrist presidency, especially over centerpiece policies like French support for Ukraine’s war against Russia.

Macron was one of the first leaders publicly to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with Western weapons, setting the stage for Washington to do the same. This has allowed Kyiv to target Russian military bases, formations and artillery used to launch attacks into Ukraine. Aside from troop deployments, Le Pen said her only “red line” on Ukraine was stopping France becoming a “co-belligerent” in the conflict via the use of long-range French missiles against targets on Russian soil. Most Western leaders currently do not consider that such supplies constitute co-belligerence with Ukraine. Le Pen: Mbappé not representative Le Pen directed most of her ire closer to home. Speaking from her party’s seat in Paris, Le Pen lashed out at French soccer star Mbappé, who has made repeated comments in recent weeks seemingly haranguing the far right. Undoubtedly the brightest star of French football today, he joined a host of celebrities this week in calling on voters to mobilize to keep the far-right from power. “There’s an emergency. We can’t leave our country in the hands of these people,” Mbappé said Thursday, following National Rally’s strong first-round showing. “It’s really urgent. I think that we’ve seen the results, it’s catastrophic.” French soccer star Kylian Mbappé, center, leaves the stadium after a training session in Hamburg, Germany, on July 4, 2024. Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images Speaking last month, earlier in the Euros 2024 soccer tournament in Germany, the striker, whose family originally come from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn’t want to “represent a country” that didn’t embody his “values.” Le Pen rejected his comments, dismissing him as unrepresentative. “French people are fed up of being lectured and advised on how to vote,” Le Pen told CNN. “Mbappé doesn’t represent French people with an immigration background, because there are far more of them living on the minimum wage, who can’t afford housing and can’t afford heating, than people like Mr. Mbappé,” she said. Accusations of racism If National Rally wins big enough in Sunday’s election, Le Pen can expect to see her loyal lieutenant Bardella installed as France’s prime minister. She will have unquestionably succeeded in bringing her party into the political mainstream. Having won nearly a third of French votes cast in the European Parliament elections in May, Le Pen refused to be labelled as a “far-right” politician, which she said carries a stigma. “It does not correspond to what we are. And not at all to what the far right is in the United States,” she claimed. Video Ad Feedback 'You're kidding me, right?'

The second pledge listed in National Rally’s manifesto is a law targeting Islamist ideologies, although it does not elaborate on how.

Ties with Russia Cohabiting with the staunchly pro-European Emmanuel Macron will have its complications for the keenly anti-Brussels National Rally.

The relatively small town of Chasiv Yar has played an outsized role in the conflict and has been battered by months of intense fighting. Sitting on high ground, it is seen as a gateway to the parts of the Donetsk region that are still in Ukrainian hands. The town overlooks the lower-laying areas to the north, towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and to the west towards Dnipropetrovsk region. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Thursday that its troops have taken over the easternmost district of Chasiv Yar. Firefighters and police officers work at a site of a Russian missile strike in the town of Vilniansk, in the Zaporizhzhia region. Reuters Related article Zelensky issues fresh weapons plea after 7 killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia region Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military said that Kyiv forces retreated from the district after their defensive positions were destroyed and it became clear that efforts to hold onto the neighborhood were becoming “inexpedient” because of the risk to the defending troops. “Over the last day, 238 attacks from all types of weapons were recorded in the Chasiv Yar area,” Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s “Khortytsia” operational and strategic grouping, told a Ukrainian national television channel. At the same time, Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Russian forces were reportedly moving towards a strategically important road that connects Bakhmut, which has been in Russian hands for more than a year, with Konstantinivka and Pokrovsk. The road is a key supply line for the Ukrainian military. The withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from parts of Chasiv Yar is a troubling development for Kyiv as it focuses on stabilizing the frontlines following months of relentless Russian assaults. Moscow took advantage of the acute shortages of ammunition experienced by Kyiv due to delays in Western military aid in the first half of this year, trying to pierce Ukraine’s defensive lines alongside the eastern frontline. It even launched a surprise cross-border offensive in northern Ukraine in order to force Kyiv to pull some troops away from the east. But the situation was starting to look better for Ukraine in recent weeks after Western weapons finally started arriving on the frontlines. A possible major Russian offensive towards Kharkiv, the second-largest Ukrainian city, was averted and the eastern front appeared more stable.

Alina Smutko/Reuters Higher ground Ukraine has insisted that it is still firmly in control of the western parts of Chasiv Yar and that the withdrawal from the eastern part was a tactical decision. DeepState, the monitoring group, said the district “has been completely wiped out” and “holding it in ruins” would only increase losses. “Leaving the neighborhood is a logical, albeit a difficult decision,” it said. The town had a pre-war population of about 12,000, but has been mostly deserted for months. Vadym Filashkin, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said in May that some 679 civilians were still in Chasiv Yar, refusing to evacuate their homes.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of the fact that he wants his forces to control the whole of Donestk. The region was dissected in half when the war broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern parts of the region. While Russia took control of a other parts of Donetsk following the launch of its full-scale invasion in February 2022, it never managed to occupy the whole of the region. If Chasiv Yar was to fall to Russian hands, it could put bigger cities to the west at risk. “Chasiv Yar the largest settlement on the way to Kramatorsk, so if Russians were to capture it, then the Ukrainians would not necessarily have the chances to rely on urban settlements to decrease the tempo of Russian attacks,” Muzyka said. Advancing through an urban environment is much more difficult compared to open terrain. Chasiv Yar itself has been the epicenter of the fight for months. Bakhmut, which sits about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Chasiv Yar, fell to Russia at a huge cost to its troops in May 2023, after many months of intense fighting. By the time Moscow claimed control over the city, it was almost completely destroyed."

The new package includes $150 million in artillery rounds, interceptor missiles and anti-tank weapons, according to the Pentagon. This portion of the package is drawn directly from US stockpiles under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) and can be delivered quickly to Ukraine. An additional $2.2 billion will be purchased for Ukraine from US arms manufacturers under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), a program that takes longer to supply the weapons but provides longer-term support for Kyiv. The USAI portion includes Patriot and NASAMS air defense missiles, two of the systems that have been critical in defending against ongoing Russian aerial barrages. “The Biden Administration plans to accelerate delivery of these munitions by re-sequencing upcoming Foreign Military Sales deliveries for Ukraine,” the Pentagon said in announcing the new package. The $2.2 billion in USAI funding for Ukraine is one of the largest such packages the US has announced, though it is dwarfed by the $6 billion USAI package announced in late-April. This is also the fifth military aid package for Ukraine since the passage of a $95 billion supplemental aid package in April, which included $61 billion in aid for Ukraine. Since the passage of the supplemental, the US has kept up a steady rhythm of military aid to Ukraine, as the Biden administration has tried to help Kyiv slow a Russian offensive that began in May. In addition to military aid, the US has also loosened some restrictions on Ukraine’s use of US weaponry, allowing Ukrainian forces to use American munitions to target Russian forces taking part in the offensive. CNN also reported last month that the Biden administration was moving towards lifting a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine to help the country’s military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems. On Tuesday, Austin hosted Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon. In opening statements before their meeting, Austin said the US would soon be announcing the $2.3 billion security package. The US has provided approximately $53.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the war."

The expected admission of Belarus to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at its annual leaders’ summit in Astana, Kazakhstan is another push by Beijing and Moscow to transform the grouping – from a regional security bloc into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. Belarus, which helped Russia to launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club, after Iran became a full member last year. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have arrived in Astana for the summit that begins Wednesday, in what will be their second meeting this year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the world’s largest democracy, is skipping the event, pointing to unease among some members about the direction the SCO is headed. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years in line with Beijing and Moscow’s shared ambition to counter what they see as US “hegemony” and reshape the international system in their favor. In 2017, the bloc underwent its first expansion to welcome India and Pakistan. After adding Belarus, it will boast 10 members, representing more than 40% of the world’s population and roughly a quarter of the global economy. It also has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and more than a dozen “dialogue partners” from Myanmar to Turkey and the Arab states. The SCO’s expansion comes after another bloc led by China and Russia, the BRICS group of major emerging economies, more than doubled its membership and significantly extended its global reach last year. Growing ambitions As the SCO grows in international visibility and economic weight, it has also broadened in geopolitical ambitions. The expected admission of Belarus, which borders the European Union, “really highlights how the SCO’s mission has changed in the last few years,” said Eva Seiwert, an expert on China’s foreign policy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin. “Unlike Iran, you don’t really get much like economic or security cooperation out of Belarus joining. And that’s why I argue that it’s more of a geopolitical move.” With Russia deep in the third year of its grinding war against Ukraine, the SCO has become a crucial diplomatic avenue for Putin, as well as a platform to showcase he’s not isolated internationally. And as China’s relations with the US have plummeted, Beijing is now less concerned about the SCO being branded an anti-Western organization – a perception that has only deepened following Iran’s admission, Seiwert said. “They want the SCO to be perceived as a major bloc that cannot be ignored anymore,” she said. “With all these countries joining, China and Russia (want to show they) both have a lot of supporters for their worldviews.” And in that shared worldview, there is no place for the US in Eurasia. In a meeting with his senior foreign ministry officials last month, Putin laid out a future vision for “a new system of bilateral and multilateral guarantees of collective security in Eurasia,” with the help of existing organizations like the SCO and a long-term goal to “gradually phase out the military presence of external powers in the Eurasian region.” “During my recent visit to China, President Xi Jinping and I discussed this issue. It was noted that the Russian proposal is not contradictory, but rather complements and aligns with the basic principles of the Chinese global security initiative,” said Putin, who visited Beijing in May. Putin speaks to Xi at the SCO summit two years ago in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Sergei Bobylev/Pool/Sputnik/AP Frictions and unease That big picture vison of an alternative future is going to be the “headline message” for China and Russia coming out of this SCO summit, said Bates Gill, a senior fellow for the National Bureau of Asian Research. But the Belarus membership also creates big question marks that will hang over the organization, Gill said. “It creates all sorts of problems and new questions about the reputation, legitimacy and mandate of the organization, given the nature of the Belarus regime and its support for Russia’s flagrant violation of international law and invasion of Ukraine,” he said. “Clearly the SCO can tolerate authoritarian regimes, but for the mandate of the organization, it further diversifies and dilutes its original focus, which was to be on Central Asia.” The bloc’s expansion hasn’t come without frictions – notably with the admission of bitter rivals India and Pakistan – while tensions between Beijing and New Delhi have also flared in recent years following deadly clashes on their disputed Himalayan border. The grouping’s increasingly anti-Western orientation following its embrace of Iran and now Belarus has also fueled unease among members that want to keep good relations with the West, including the former Soviet states in Central Asia. “In some respects, it puts the Central Asian states in a very awkward position,” Gill said. “They are pursuing what they like to call multi-trajectory diplomacy. They don’t want to be committed to only dealing with one major power, like Russia or China.” Gill, who visited Central Asia in April and May, said there was an ambivalence in regional capitals about the future of the SCO. Modi is skipping India, too, appeared to be losing interest. Last year, it hosted the summit virtually – a muted arrangement that allowed Modi to avoid the optics of welcoming Putin and Xi to New Delhi as it sought closer ties with the US. This year, fresh from his third consecutive term inauguration, the Indian leader is skipping the summit in Astana – despite Russian state media reports that he will visit the Kremlin next week. “This tells us that he does not see the SCO as the most effective channel through which to pursue Indian interests in this part of the world,” Gill said. Even China, the main driver behind the SCO’s expansion, is seeking a more direct way to engage with Central Asia – without Russia’s involvement.

Li Xueren/Xinhua/Getty Images Related article BRICS expansion is a big win for China. But can it really work as a counterweight to the West? Last year, five leaders from the region received a lavish welcome at the inaugural China-Central Asia summit in the Chinese city of Xi’an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked imperial China with civilizations to its west over a millennium ago. In March, a permanent Secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism was established in the same city. And while China and Russia aspire to present the SCO as a counterweight to US-led institutions, it remains a much weaker and less cohesive bloc compared with the likes of NATO, the European Union or the Group of Seven nations. “Given the expansion of membership with India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, the organization will be even less like an alliance or committed common grouping, and more like a strategic-vision type of organization … representative of a Eurasian identity,” Gill said. After the summit in Astana, China is due to take up the rotating presidency of the SCO for a year. Seiwert, the expert at MERICS, said Beijing would work to find more common ground among member states. “For China, it’s important that the SCO doesn’t fail, that it is perceived as successful.

Standing alongside Zelensky on Tuesday, Orban, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has criticized European support for Ukraine, said: “I asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks, with making a ceasefire first.” Orban continued: “A ceasefire connected to a deadline would give a chance to speed up peace talks. I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiation.” The Hungarian leader has touted the idea of ending the war with a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine numerous times since Russia’s military flooded across the border in 2022. Zelensky dismissed the idea, according to his office. Speaking on national TV on Monday, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelensky’s office, said that even though Orban “was given the opportunity to express his thoughts” during his visit to Kyiv, Zelensky’s position on this issue “is clear, understandable and known.” Zelensky previously rejected French President Emmanuel Macron’s Olympic ceasefire proposal citing its potential to inadvertently benefit Russians on the ground. According to Zhovkva, Kyiv’s number one tool to end hostilities is through a second peace summit, which Ukraine is already preparing for. “We are saying that Ukraine will draft its peace plan, a roadmap for establishing peace in Ukraine. It will develop it with all the states that are ready. Hungary is also ready for this. And then, if the aggressor country is ready to listen to this plan, ready to talk about this plan, and not to speak the language of ultimatums, then yes, during the second summit, we can say that representatives of the Russian Federation may attend this summit in one way or another,” he said. Orban also stated his desire to improve relations between Budapest and Kyiv, which have been strained by the Hungarian leader’s close relationship with Putin. “We would like to make the relationship between the two countries better,” Orban said. “We would like to make a broad bilateral agreement with Ukraine, similar to the ones we already made with our neighbors (in the past). We would be happy to take part in the modernization of Ukraine’s economy, we would like an ordered framework for this.” The authoritarian Hungarian leader has regularly attempted to block European Union initiatives offering further military and financial support to Kyiv during the conflict.

Their bond is underpinned by both economic cooperation and some shared values. Both leaders have also enacted anti-LGBTQ policies and clamped down on freedom of speech in their countries. Hungary has supported Russia at a United Nations level and rejected EU sanctions following Putin’s aggression in Ukraine as early as 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Tuesday’s meeting comes as Orban and Hungary take control of the EU Council’s rotating presidency, which changes every six months. During each six-month period, the country controlling the presidency does not take control of the EU’s overall agenda, but does have a platform through which they can hammer home their own priorities. On the EU Council’s website, it likens holding the presidency “to someone hosting a dinner, making sure their guests all gather in harmony,” adding that to “guarantee effectiveness, the presidency acts as an ‘honest broker,’ rising above the holder’s own national interest.” Orban took control of the presidency on Monday with a call to “Make Europe Great Again,” a reference to Donald Trump’s political slogan that will alarm many of his European counterparts who are braced for the former US president’s potential return to the White House, concerned about what it will mean for the EU. Other key European diplomatic meetings are planned for July. NATO will celebrate 75 years of the alliance in Washington, DC between July 9 and 11. The agenda for that event is expected to be dominated by long-term plans to support Ukraine and conversations about its eventual accession to the alliance. Talks between the two leaders will focus on “possibilities for achieving peace, as well as current issues in Hungarian-Ukrainian bilateral relations,” a Hungarian government spokesperson said. Zoltan Fischer/MTI/AP The European Political Community (EPC), a forum for 47 European countries, inside and outside the EU, to discuss the continent’s strategic challenges, will also meet on July 18 in the United Kingdom. Ukraine and Hungary are both members of the EPC. It is expected that Ukraine will dominate that agenda and Zelensky may attend the meeting in person. Orban may have had this in mind when timing this trip to Kyiv, ensuring that his first meeting with Ukraine’s president since the start of the war was not in such a public and high-stakes diplomatic setting.

The US has been announcing regular packages for Ukraine since Congress passed legislation that approved nearly $61 billion in Ukraine aid earlier this year. The US recently moved Ukraine to the top of the list to receive air defense capabilities, putting it ahead of other countries who may have already been in line to receive them. A White House official told CNN at the time that in private discussions, “many of these countries have understood and appreciated the necessity of this decision.” “If any of our partners were in an existential situation like the one that Ukraine is in right now, we would move heaven and earth to help them and it just so happens that right now that country is Ukraine,” the official said. The announcement comes just weeks after the US and Ukraine signed a long-term bilateral security pact that commits the US to 10 years of training Ukraine’s armed forces, providing military assistance and increasing intelligence sharing. It also comes one week before the NATO summit held in Washington, DC. Austin said Tuesday that they would “take steps to build a bridge to NATO membership for Ukraine.” Umerov thanked Austin for his support and said Ukraine has used it to stop Russia, “stop the aggression towards people, towards our values, national interests.” He said he looked forward to discussing the possibility of Ukraine becoming a future NATO member. “Hopefully soon, Ukraine will receive its invitation,” Umerov said of NATO."

In a Telegram post, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed the plot organizers planned to trigger a riot in Kyiv on June 30 as a distraction to seize control of the Ukrainian parliament and remove the military and political leadership from power. It is unclear how viable the planned plot was, or if those accused have any connection with Russia, which has waged a devastating full-scale invasion against its southwestern neighbor for nearly two and a half years. Four suspects have been identified, with two held in custody, the SBU said. They face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. The SBU said it seized weapons and ammunition, as well as cellphones, computers and other records “with evidence of criminal action.” The office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general said the alleged leader of the plot “is a head of a non-governmental entity, who already had the experience of participating in fruitless provocative events.” The suspect rented a hall with a capacity of 2,000 people and was looking to recruit military personnel and armed guards from private companies to “carry out the seizure” of parliament, the prosecutor’s office said. It is unclear if authorities are seeking any more suspects. “To implement the criminal plan, the main organizer involved several accomplices—representatives of the community organizations from Kyiv, Dnipro, and other regions,” the SBU said. The alleged scheme in Kyiv comes as Russia has made slow but steady battlefield gains in recent months, exploiting Ukraine’s diminishing manpower and reliance on the West for weapons – and uncertainty over the future of that military aid. Russian forces killed seven people, including three children, in a missile strike on the southern town of Vilniansk Saturday, according to Ukrainian officials, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to appeal for more long-range weapons . “I am grateful to all partners who are helping. And the decisions we need must be accelerated. Any delay in decisions in this war means losing human lives,” Zelensky wrote on Telegram. Concerns have grown over the future of US military support for Ukraine with the potential for another Donald Trump presidency on the horizon. During last week’s presidential debate, Trump questioned whether the United States should continue to fund Ukraine’s fight against Russia.

The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year’s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk’s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother’s life even in the depths of grief. “Of course, it affects people and, of course, me – the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,” she told CNN. “All this takes strength, takes energy. It’s like a poison for the body.” “We have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it’s very hard, it’s very difficult, but to be honest, I don’t know where I’ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It’s something incredible, even for me.” Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and – though that’s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago – their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia’s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine’s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes – from Olympic and non-Olympic sports – have served for the country’s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year – her first medal at a major event – and was hoping to be part of Ukraine’s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. Video Ad Feedback World Athletics President Seb Coe visits Ukraine in road to the Olympics 05:44 - Source: CNN She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. “You can’t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,” Tabashnyk said. “But every time I pull myself together and say, ‘No, now I have to fight like never before.’ And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.” She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia’s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year’s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk’s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. “We were all stressed out because we were thinking, ‘Oh, no, he’s not ready yet, he cannot go there,’” the 29-year-old told CNN. “But we were doing our best to support him, because if he’s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.” Tkachuk competes at last year's World Athletics Championships, where she reached the semifinals. Hannah Peters/Getty Images Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. “He’s texted me a message: ‘You will win there, and I will win here,’” she said. “Something like this. … He has in his pocket – close to his heart – small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It’s nice to know this.” Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia’s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine’s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. “Now, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,” Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine’s acting sports minister, told CNN.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements . This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes’ participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. “We think that this position is strong enough,” said Bidnyi, “but we think it would be better if they were banned totally.” There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level – the only Olympic sports federation to have done so.

Ukrainian Presidential Press Service Related article Exclusive: World Athletics president invites Ukrainian president to the Olympics in surprise visit to Kyiv This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. “This is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I’m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don’t need,” she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. “We’re not friends, we’re not competitors,” Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. “They don’t have a right to be at the Olympics … because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.” Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn’t always easy. “Home is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,” says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. “In the training camps, it’s totally different in other countries; it’s good, some countries are really amazing, but it’s not my native (country). I can’t relax fully there.” Ryzhykova competes at the World Athletics Championships in Hungary, Budapest. Hannah Peters/Getty Images Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. “I use books, novels or something easier,” she said. “When I have bad thoughts, I’m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It’s my plan for competition day.” CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report."

A two-time Olympic champion, Coe is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. But he’s at odds with the IOC when it comes to their stance on Russian athletes. Following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine – supported by Belarus – in February 2022, World Athletics is the only Olympic sports federation to have banned all Russian and Belarussian athletes from elite competition . The IOC, on the other hand, has allowed dozens of athletes from those two countries to compete as neutrals at this month’s Paris Games. Zelensky has said “there is no such thing as neutrality when a war like this is going on,” and that “any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood.” Ukraine’s road to the Olympics has been riddled with obstacles. According to the country’s Sports Ministry, more than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed in Russian attacks. Hundreds of athletes have been killed, and many others forced to train abroad. In the meeting with the Ukrainian president, World Athletics committed to keep providing financial support for the country’s athletes. They also discussed other initiatives, including the creation of a program that would support 18- to 22-year-old competitors and their coaches, so they can continue to compete in athletics at an international level. Coe also stopped by the Ukrainian Athletics Championships in Lviv, the event that determined which athletes will compete in the Olympics. “You are an absolute inspiration,” he told a group of athletes who gathered to meet him. Before leaving the country, a visibly emotional Coe recalled arriving in Kyiv in the early morning alongside a medical train with civilian casualties from the front line. “And leaving Kyiv last night, and witnessing the night train coming in, in exactly the same way and just looking at parents and brothers, sisters … It was a sobering, sobering moment,” he told CNN. As to whether Zelensky accepted his invitation to go to the Games, Coe said he “wasn’t sure whether his diary was going to allow him to do that. But I think he was warming to the idea as the conversation developed.”"

Recent battlefield developments have seen Russia make slow but steady tactical gains along multiple fronts in Ukraine. Russia also launched a surprise cross-border assault in May. In the Donetsk region, Russia has made advances towards Chasiv Yar as it attempts to capture the strategic hilltop town. During its offensive Russia has been exploiting Ukraine’s weak spots including thinly stretched manpower and delays in western supplies. As Zelensky repeats his appeals for more long-range weapons, these developments have again highlighted Ukraine’s reliance on ammunition and weapons from the United States and other allies. Concerns have been raised over how long aid from the US will continue should former US President Donald Trump be reelected this November. Thursday’s debate saw US President Joe Biden struggle, while Trump questioned continuing to fund Ukraine’s fight against Russia. A Ukrainian politician, Oleksiy Goncharenko, told CNN that Trump’s comments on the war in Ukraine were “worrying.” “We’re very concerned because we, more or less, understand what it means for Ukraine, [a] Biden presidency, and we really don’t know what it means for Ukraine, a Trump presidency.

Until, that is, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala revealed it was “very likely” that Moscow was behind it. The accusation prompted alarm among security officials and governments because several similar incidents have occurred across Europe in recent months. The Museum of Occupation in Riga was targeted in an arson attack in February. A London warehouse burnt down in March and a shopping center in Warsaw went up in flames in May. Police in Germany arrested several people suspected of planning explosions and arson attacks in April, and French authorities launched an anti-terror investigation after detaining a suspected bomb-maker who was injured in a botched explosion earlier this month. Multiple hacking attacks and spying incidents have been reported in different European countries. As the same time, the European Union has accused Russia and Belarus of weaponizing migration by pushing asylum seekers from third countries to its borders. There have also been several suspicious attacks against individuals: a Russian defector was found shot dead in Spain and an opposition figure exiled in Lithuania was brutally attacked with a hammer . The seemingly random attacks have one thing in common: according to local officials, they are all linked to Russia. And while they might look minor in isolation, taken together these incidents amount to what security experts say is Russia’s hybrid war on the West. “We are threatened by something which is not a full-fledged military attack, which are these hybrid threats … everything from meddling in our political processes, (undermining) the trust in our political institutions, disinformation, cyber-attacks (…) and sabotage actions against critical infrastructure,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during an event in Canada last week. Rod Thornton, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King’s College London, said there’s been a pattern of attacks linked back to Russia. “There has definitely been an increase over the last few months in these particular types of operations. It is something that the Russians are ramping up,” Thornton said. Photo illustration by CNN/Getty Images Related article Doppelgängers and deepfakes: Russian trolls are meddling in the world’s second-biggest democratic vote Moscow has not claimed responsibility for any of the attacks and has not responded to CNN’s request for comment, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he sees the war in Ukraine as part of a broader conflict with NATO and that his regime views the government in Kyiv as a mere proxy of the West. And with every increase of Western aid to Ukraine – whether through new weapons deliveries , or the imposition of new sanctions on Russia – the Kremlin has stepped up its saber-rattling. Thornton said Russia was resorting to a campaign of sabotage as an alternative to a full-on war with NATO, which would be disastrous for Russia. “It’s long been a part of Russian military doctrine to try and avoid trying to face NATO on a battlefield, because they know they would lose to NATO forces,” he said. “What they are doing is undertaking activities which are below the threshold of armed conflict, so they are not inciting an Article 5 response from NATO,” he added. Article 5 is the cornerstone principle that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members. It’s only been invoked once – after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States by al Qaeda. Thornton said that by deliberately keeping the attacks below the threshold of armed conflict, Russia is hoping to sow more divisions within NATO because there is no clear blueprint on how to act. “NATO only works when all member states of NATO act in unison. It’s no good if the US, the UK, maybe France say, let’s do this against Russia, and if the other countries say, well, you know, we don’t want to do that, we need to wait on this.” Nicole Wolkov, a Russia researcher at the US-based Institute for the Study of War, said Russia’s main goal now is to disrupt the flows of Western military aid to Ukraine. “These hybrid operations are part of Russia’s war effort to weaken Western resolve to support Ukraine and undermine unity within the West,” she said, warning that in the long term, Russia might be gearing up for a more direct confrontation. “Russia is, and has been since before the war, conducting these hybrid operations against NATO, the West, the EU, in tandem with its attempts to improve its conventional military abilities for a potential future conflict with NATO,” she told CNN. Years in the making Russia-watchers say Moscow has been beefing up its hybrid war units for years. The most obvious sign of this, they say, was the promotion of a notorious spy commander, Andrei Averyanov, into the top ranks of the GRU in 2020. Averyanov allegedly oversaw the 2018 Novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in England, and the 2014 blast in an ammunition depot in the Czech Republic that killed two people. Now the deputy head of the GRU, he is wanted in the Czech Republic over his role in the blast in the town of Vrbetice. Russia has repeatedly denied its involvement in both events. “He was previously the head of 29155 unit, which is known for its participation in the Salisbury attack, they attempted to organize that coup d’etat in Montenegro, they had operations to destabilize Moldova and Macedonia,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, an associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a UK defense and security think tank, and a former Ukrainian defense and foreign intelligence official. “His promotion and the creation of a new Special Activity Division that has new powers to recruit their own assets … it’s a very strong indicator that Russia is trying to expand its capabilities,” he added. Czech Police said that the suspected arsonist in the recent bus station incident was a 26-year-old foreigner who had only arrived in the Czech Republic five days earlier. Fiala, the prime minister, alleged the man was paid for his actions. The amateurish nature of the Prague attack – the perpetrator did not manage to cause any significant damage and was caught – fits the pattern. “At the moment, most of these people are just proxies that are paid by the GRU, they aren’t trained to do these types of operations, they might be seen as a testing mechanism conducted by the Russians to see where the weaknesses of Western critical national infrastructure are,” said Danylyuk.

The office of the German Federal Public Prosecutor said the people who were arrested on suspicion of planning arson attacks and explosions on behalf of Russia were “in contact” with Russian security officials, rather than being spies themselves. In Poland , a man arrested for spying and planning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s assassination was also a local citizen. Danylyuk said the Russian security apparatus doesn’t shy away from using criminals to do its dirty work, tapping into its links with international organized crime. “What is actually super dangerous and disturbing is that they are using these networks, plus a lot of potentially violent organizations, radical groups, far-right groups, far-left groups,” he said. Cybercrime and disinformation Most of the attacks uncovered so far have been relatively minor, suggesting that Russia’s goal isn’t as much about inflicting the biggest possible damage as scaring the local population. “The aim is to break the will of the citizens and to break the support for Ukraine. If you were living peacefully in your country and suddenly you have a series of terrorist attacks, and this is all attributed to your country supporting Ukraine, that puts pressure on your support for Ukraine,” said Olga Lautman, a security researcher who specializes in the intersection of organized crime and intelligence operations in Russia. Many of the attacks are accompanied by a disinformation campaign designed to deflect the blame from Russia, researchers say. That’s very much what happened in the aftermath of the failed arson attack in Prague, according to research from Czech Elves, a group of volunteer activists who monitor, analyze and fight disinformation campaigns that appear on the Czech internet. The group said that disinformation campaigns it monitored tried to trivialize the attacks and discredit the Czech government. One narrative sought to portray the accusation by Fiala that Russia was behind the arson as an attempt to distract from the government’s poor showing in the European Parliament election. Others mocked the facts, saying the attack affected “only” a few buses. A file photo shows investigators at the scene of the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England. Frank Augstein/AP “You have these terrorist attacks and at the same time disinformation operations are blaming the politicians in charge, saying this is why Germany or Poland or the United States should not be involved in supporting Ukraine, because this is not their war,” Lautman said. The disinformation campaigns appear to go hand-in-hand with cyberattacks. Multiple countries across Europe have suffered major hacks in recent months. Authorities in Finland and Estonia said the GPS signal was being jammed regularly, causing disruptions to flights. Multiple French government departments suffered what the French described as “a massive cyberattack” in February and, earlier this month, a blood-testing laboratory servicing multiple hospitals in England became a target of a ransomware attack. Yet Thornton said these incidents are likely just the beginning. “What Russian cyber operatives are doing now is testing weaknesses within cyber security systems, planting malware, finding out where and how to attack without doing it now,” he said. “They’ll wait for the big day when they need them.” Underestimating Russia NATO has for months been warning about Russia’s unconventional attacks on the West, saying Moscow is using espionage, cyber-attacks, electoral interference, disinformation and sabotage trying to destabilize the bloc and weaken its resolve to help Ukraine. But until recently, European leaders were reluctant to point a finger directly at the Kremlin. According to Lautman, Moscow has become emboldened over recent years, because it has rarely been held accountable. The US and some European countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine in 2014. However, it wasn’t until Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 that the West really flexed its sanctions muscle against Russia. Lautman, who is a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the complacency towards Russian attacks goes back to at least the 2006 killing of Alexander Litvinenko in London. The former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic was poisoned by a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210, in what the European Court of Human Rights said was a state-sponsored attack by Russia. The Kremlin has always denied the accusation. Undated handout file photo issued by the Metropolitan Police of Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov.

Metropolitan Police/PA Related article Russian suspects in Salisbury poisoning linked to blast in Czech Republic “They got away with it. Everyone knew it was Russia. I mean, the [alleged] assassin Andrei Lugovoi was promoted and put into the Duma,” Lautman said, adding: “And with Skripal, I will never forget (Prime Minister) Theresa May giving Russia an ultimatum to provide answers. And they delivered another dead body within 48 hours – Nikolai Glushkov.” Glushkov, a Putin critic, was living in the UK after being granted political asylum. He was found dead in his home in London a week after the Salisbury poisoning. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police told CNN that a post-mortem found that he had been strangled and that a murder investigation led by detectives from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command continues. No arrests have been made and no motive established. Thornton said that NATO was reluctant to blame the Skripal poisoning directly on Putin and the Russian state because of the risk of escalation and pushing Russia into being a “complete adversary.” “(They) would kind of said maybe it was a rogue GRU operation, was Putin really behind it? There was an element of ‘let’s not go too far, because we don’t want to lose Putin completely,’” he said. “Now that’s completely off the table,” he added. While many of the more high-profile attacks – the Litvinenko and Skripal poisonings, for example – are thought to have been approved or even ordered directly by Putin, the desire to hurt the West cuts through the Russian political establishment, analysts say. The people known as siloviki — Russia’s most powerful men (they are almost exclusively men) who rose to power through the ranks of the Soviet and Russian security services – see the relationship between the West and Russia as a zero-sum game. Russia can only be strong if the West and NATO are weak. “Russia has always been antagonistic towards the West,” Thornton said. “It goes way back to tsarist times, the idea of the West being a threat, that the West wants to do Russia down, to make Russia a smaller state, a weak state … so whoever you put in power in the Kremlin, there’s still going to be this mindset that the West is in essence the enemy.” Lautman agreed, adding that the current establishment’s hatred towards the West stems partly from the events following the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, when Russia had to be bailed out by the West after its economy collapsed. The idea that Russia’s aggression will end with the eventual demise of Putin is the West’s “biggest mistake,” she said, predicting successive leaders will continue to see the West as an enemy until the country gives up the idea of Russian imperialism – which won’t happen easily. “And Europe, and the whole international community who wants global stability, they need to understand that Russia is at war with us and that they will continue escalating unless we start acting.”"

CNN — From the US and Germany to Poland and Ukraine, creators have been volunteering their time and talent to support United24 , Ukraine’s official fundraising platform, by recreating Ukrainian monuments as one of a kind Lego sets. These sets aren’t available for purchase; they can only be won through a raffle, by donating $24 or more to United24, with contributions going toward rebuilding destroyed structures and other relief efforts amid the country’s ongoing defensive war against Russia. Roy Schwartz courtesy of Roy Schwartz Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky created United24 as a personal initiative to attract more international aid through mass appeal fundraising projects such as soccer games, art shows, music videos, celebrity ambassadors and even a donation center on Minecraft , with a virtual recreation of Ukraine’s Soledar salt mines. According to United24 Coordinator Yaroslava Gres, the name United24 comes from the initiative’s “goal to provide 24/7 assistance…in support of Ukraine” — but the number 24 holds an even deeper connotation for Ukrainians. August 24 is Ukraine’s Independence Day , and Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Gres told me that United24 has raised over $650 million since they launched in May 2022 , with donors from 110 countries helping rebuild and reconstruct five hospitals, 18 residential buildings, 24 bridges, and buy 240 ambulances and 659 hospital generators. Donations have also helped fund defense systems against suicide drones and tens of thousands of Ukrainian drones , and develop battlefield robots . Amidst concerns over Ukraine’s endemic governmental corruption , including a recent weapons procurement scandal , United24’s fundraising is assured by international accounting firm Deloitte, which has been volunteering its services pro bono. Last month, the US sent Ukraine $275 million in military assistance as part of a $6 billion long-term military aid package announced in late April. So far, the US has sent $175 billion in total to the Ukraine. But according to a report by the Council on Foreign Relations, humanitarian support only accounts for $2.9 billion of that . The World Bank recently estimated that, between February 2022 and December 2023, the total damage to the Ukrainian infrastructure and economy was $152 billion. Gres told me that 391 schools have been destroyed and 3,282 damaged, requiring nearly $14 billion to rebuild, with another $14 billion needed to rebuild and repair medical facilities. Pictured in Lego miniature is Kyiv’s Golden Gate, released as part of United24's second wave of Ukrainian monument replicas. UNITED24 As the war between Russia and Ukraine nears its 30 th month in August, the world’s fickle attention has largely diverted to the Middle East and the upcoming US elections . United24 hopes to maintain focus on Ukraine’s fight for survival, a fight that isn’t going well — in recent months, Russia has captured and recaptured strategic locations, in its fastest advance since the beginning of the war. Lego is arguably the best toy ever invented , but a toy is still a strange choice for a war fund campaign. And yet, it has helped support Ukraine from the start. In March 2022, a month into the war, and again in September 2022, the Lego Foundation donated around $30 million to help rebuild schools and other education institutions in Ukraine, as well as provide educational assistance for Ukrainian refugees in other countries. In March 2022, Chicago-based toymaker Citizen Brick raised over $145,000 for Ukraine with a custom Lego-based minifigure of Zelensky. The inspiration for a Lego campaign came from these initiatives and from Lego Architecture , an adult-oriented line of sets recreating iconic landmarks. According to Gres, “If it includes the … Eiffel Tower, London Bridge and Statue of Liberty … why can’t it have Kyiv’s Motherland Monument?” United24’s first wave of sets , released in November 2023, is titled #LEGOWITHUKRAINE , which includes Kyiv’s Mother Ukraine, Crimea’s Swallow’s Nest and Mariupol’s Old Water Tower. The second wave, #UKRAINEinLEGObricks , released last month , includes Kyiv’s Golden Gate, Crimea’s Khan Palace, Lviv’s Oblast’s Pidhirtsi Castle, Odesa’s National Academic Opera and Mykolaiv’s Astronomical Observatory. Mykolaiv’s Astronomical Observatory is featured in Lego's second wave of monument recreations. UNITED24 All models are made from authentic Lego bricks, though the Lego company isn’t affiliated with the project nor the artists building the sets. Each of the second wave’s five models is available in three sets, meaning donors have a chance of winning 1 of 15 sets . Donors can choose which of the set raffles they want to enter and, Gres says, which of United24’s five goals their donation supports — defense, humanitarian demining, medical aid, rebuilding Ukraine or education and science — though proceeds from the second wave all go toward the reconstruction of the Velykokostromska School , a kindergarten and grade school in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which was bombed in October 2022. Mark Segedie is an American Lego artist from Chicago and the creator of the Pidhirtsi Castle set . “This was such a unique way to combine my passion for Lego with a very worthy cause — help rebuild a destroyed school … Thanks to this project, 250 children in Ukraine will be able to return to studies,” he told me. It took him about 80 hours to design and build the set, once he selected the landmark he wanted to recreate, and five months to finish the project. “It was incredibly challenging to get the scaling and the angles of the castle correct,” he says. “It really challenged me. I feel that I was able to expand my Lego building skills while contributing to a great cause.” Eric Law , another American Lego artist, created the Golden Gate set . He told me that he’d first heard of the project on a Lego fan site called The Brothers Brick and “joined because when I saw the Golden Gate I thought it would be an interesting building to build. … but after I read the history on it, I fell in love with the idea of building it.” Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook It took him a month to design it digitally, his first time doing it on a computer, then another week to build the actual set. “The shape is full of arches,” he told me, “and getting the shape right took six times of rebuilding.” “I live in an area near Tacoma that has a large community of Ukrainians. I also work with many,” Law continued. “When I had the model I showed it off to them and seeing the look on their faces really is a joy.” Gres says that, though she hopes there’ll be a third wave of Lego sets, “for now, we are concentrating on attracting attention to the second drop.” The road ahead for Ukraine is difficult and uncertain, but it can rebuild with the help of little toy bricks."

No final agreement has been reached to transfer the crucial systems - and the countries are still working through specific logistics - but the administration official said they are hopeful the efforts might succeed, especially given the effectiveness of the Patriot batteries already operating in Ukraine. The US and Germany have already sent Patriot systems to Ukraine, but the Biden administration has made it clear that Kyiv needs more as Russia continues to launch aerial attacks on the country. It is unclear how long the process of finalizing details and transferring the systems to Ukraine would take. The systems would likely need to be transferred to the US first, where they would undergo refurbishment, before being sent to Ukraine. If completed, the transfer would mark a significant shift in Israel’s position regarding the war in Ukraine. Israel has been careful not to overtly criticize Russia, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to walk a fine line with President Vladimir Putin. Russia in 2022 warned that providing Israeli arms to Ukraine would “destroy all interstate relations between our countries.” Though Israel has participated in the US-led multinational group to ship supplies to Ukraine, the Israeli government has been loathe to openly provide Kyiv with weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for Iron Dome missile interceptors months after Russia’s invasion began. But Israel said it would only help Ukraine develop an air defense system instead of sending weapons, an offer Ukraine’s ambassador to Israel said was “too late.” The Financial Times first reported news of the ongoing discussions. In April, the Israel Defense Forces said it would soon retire its Patriot systems, which were first fully integrated into the military in 1991. The first Israeli Patriot intercept came during the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, when the system shot down a drone launched from Gaza. But the Patriot missiles is not Israel’s primary air defense system. To date, the IDF said Israeli Patriot batteries have carried out 19 interceptions, including nine during the current war. Israel relies far more on its short-range Iron Dome aerial defense system, as well as its medium-range David’s Sling and long-range Arrow missiles. Last week, the Biden administration announced that it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival” in what was described as a “rather extraordinary” policy adjustment at a critical moment for Ukraine. “We work with all of our partners to take into account what [Ukraine’s] defense needs are, and we’re going to do everything we can to support those,” said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder at a news briefing last week. “The bottom-line message here to our allies and partners is, if there’s an existential threat, you know, we’re going to step up and we’re going to help you.”"

The forward not only inspired Georgia to the knockout stages of Euro 2024 on Wednesday, he also realized his own childhood dream by doing so against Cristiano Ronaldo. Georgia is the lowest-ranked team at this year’s European Championship and few gave the nation a chance of progressing out of the group stages in what is its debut appearance at a major tournament. But against all odds, the Crusaders produced a memorable performance to secure a deserved 2-0 Group F win against Portugal, thanks to a second-minute goal from Kvaratskhelia and a second-half penalty from Georges Mikautadze. The full-time whistle sparked jubilant scenes on the pitch and in the stands, with tears of joy flowing around the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen. Meanwhile, fireworks lit up the sky of Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, after the win, with fans flooding out onto the streets to celebrate the historic achievement. “This is the best day in the lives of Georgians,” Kvaratskhelia told reporters after the game, per Reuters. “Everybody is so happy, we just made history. Nobody would believe that we would make it happen and we would defeat Portugal. But I think this is why we’re a strong team.” Cristiano Ronaldo shakes hands with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia as he was substituted off in the second half. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Speaking to CNN Sport the morning after the match, Georgia’s assistant manager David Webb described the atmosphere after the final whistle as “immense” as players and staff “let go” while celebrating with the fans. The coach, a vital cog in manager Willy Sagnol’s team, said the squad had been “calm” ahead of the crunch tie and managed to execute the game plan to perfection. Webb, known for his ability to motivate players on a more personal level, said he had delivered a presentation before the tournament which focused on self belief. He said his speech drew on motivation from smaller nations, such as Wales and Iceland , which had punched above their weight at previous European Championships – Wales reached the semifinals and Iceland the quarterfinals at Euro 2016. “It was about giving the players a bit of belief that there is no reason we can’t do something like that as well,” Webb added. The assistant manager said players and staff enjoyed the “special” celebrations after the match, but reassured that they didn’t go on too late. Ronaldo encouragement Videos on social media showed the team’s excitement in the locker room, with Kvaratskhelia wearing Ronaldo’s shirt. Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo had been frustrated for much of the match but had given his shirt to an emotional Kvaratskhelia following the defeat. Before the match on Wednesday, a picture from 2013 was circulating on social media of Ronaldo standing in the middle of a group of young children on a trip to Tbilisi. One of those children was Kvaratskhelia, who later posted it to his Instagram Story . The Napoli forward also spoke to his childhood hero before the match and said Ronaldo had wished him luck. “When he comes to you before the match and when he says that I wish you success, that is amazing,” Kvaratskhelia added.

This coach might be its secret weapon “I realized that actually I could do and we could do so many things today because it gave us so much incentive.” Before celebrating with his teammates, Kvaratskhelia ran over to console Ronaldo after the full time whistle – Portugal still qualified as group winners despite the defeat. Georgia’s talisman then posted a photo of Ronaldo’s shirt with his Man of the Match award on Instagram , with the caption “Dreams.” Despite helping Napoli win the Serie A title in 2023, Kvaratskhelia said that beating Portugal and reaching the knockout stages with his country was the biggest achievement of his career to date. “This is the best day in my life because it was more difficult to do it with the Georgian team than with the Napoli team,” he said. “There was no individual best player,” he said. “It was teamwork and we proved to anyone that we could really play.” Georgia will need to count on Kvaratskhelia again when it plays Spain in the last 16 on Sunday, if it stands any chance of going deeper in the tournament. “We’ve done really well to get to this stage and to write another page in Georgian history,” Webb said. “So we go into Spain game with no fear, lots of belief, lots of confidence, and we’ll give it our best and see where we go.”"

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia gave Georgia the lead inside two minutes after an awful error in the Portuguese defense, before Georges Mikautadze scored the second from the penalty spot in the second half. Getty Images Related article Georgia made history by reaching Euro 2024. This coach might be its secret weapon Competing at the first major tournament in the nation’s history, Georgia has captured the hearts of fans at Euro 2024 for its fearlessness and high-intensity football. Both were on display again in Wednesday’s deserved victory as Georgia eventually saw out the win with relative ease, qualifying for the knockout stages as one of the tournament’s four best third-place teams. Elsewhere, Turkey’s 2-1 win against Czech Republic means the team finishes second in Group F behind Portugal. Portugal had already qualified for the knockout stages with wins over Czech Republic and Turkey and was looking to become just the second team after Spain to win all three group games at Euro 2024. Georgia, meanwhile, knew only a win would be enough to reach the round of 16. The lowest-ranked team at Euro 2024, Georgia had proven to be no pushover in its games so far during the tournament, losing narrowly against Turkey and drawing with Czech Republic. Francisco Conceicao of Portugal heads the ball during the Group F match against Georgia at Arena AufSchalke on June 26, 2024 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Pablo Morano/BSR Agency/Getty Images Given the team had already qualified, perhaps a lack of focus and intensity led to Portugal gifting Georgia the opening goal less than two minutes into the game. An awful back pass by Antonio Silva gave the ball straight to Mikautadze, whose through ball found Kvaratskhelia inside the box and the Napoli forward finished brilliantly across Diogo Costa. So loud was the roar that went up inside the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen that it might have been heard back in Tbilisi. Portugal dominated possession for the rest of first half but was limited to long shots by a diligent Georgia defense. Goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was equal to them all, keeping out efforts from an increasingly frustrated Ronaldo and João Félix. Ronaldo let his annoyance get the better of him after claiming he should have been awarded a penalty for having his shirt pulled, resulting in yellow card for dissent. For all of Portugal’s dominance, Georgia should have doubled its lead after 35 minutes but Giorgi Gvelesiani couldn’t make contact with his header after rising highest to try and get on the end of Kvaratskhelia’s free kick. Kvaratskhelia then had a glorious opportunity to get Georgia’s second just minutes into the second half after more poor defending from Portugal, but scuffed his shot from just 10 yards out. Georgia, however, was not to be denied its second goal. After a long wait for a break in play – that only came when Mamardashvili sensationally tipped Diogo Dalot’s long-range strike behind for a corner – VAR ruled that Otar Kiteishvili had been fouled inside the penalty area in an earlier passage of play. Mikautadze stepped up and calmly side-footed the ball into the bottom corner to send thousands of Georgia fans inside the Arena AufSchalke wild for a second time this evening. That was Mikautadze’s third goal of the tournament, making him the top scorer at Euro 2024. Georgia was far from just hanging on to its lead in the second half and was good value for its two-goal advantage, comfortably holding Portugal at arm’s length. Of the two teams, Georgia looked the most likely to get the next goal and was a constant threat on the counterattack. Nelson Semedo had the best chance of the half for Portugal, but the indomitable Mamardashvili got down sharply again to preserve the clean sheet. When the referee blew for full time, the Georgian bench emptied onto the pitch and the players celebrated in front of their fans as though they had won the entire tournament. Ranked 74th in the world and a nation of less than four million people, this was the greatest night of football in the country’s history. This story has been updated with additional reporting."

Now they’re being welcomed by locals.,"Jun 26, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Svitlana Vlasova,Ukraine,"CNN — Before Russia invaded Ukraine, visitors from abroad frequently travelled to see Chernobyl, the nuclear power station that disastrously went into meltdown in 1986. After the release of the HBO series “Chernobyl” in 2019, record numbers of visitors poured into the exclusion zone around the abandoned city of Pripyat, which housed the plant’s workers, according to official numbers. Back then, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to pave the way for more tourists. New land, water and air routes were planned. Museums were being developed. A new modern hotel was on its way. Up to one million tourists a year were expected by 2025. Then the war started and everything changed. Russia attacked and Chernobyl, for a while, became the frontline as Russian troops occupied the exclusion zone, destroyed infrastructure and dug trenches in the radioactive dirt of the infamous Red Forest where dying trees turned the color of rust after being contaminated by fallout. The area is now de-occupied but active fighting continues along the frontlines. For the most part, only official delegations and military personnel currently have access to the exclusion zone. But even as fighting rages in the south, east and north of Ukraine, travellers are still heading to the country, drawn by scars from the ravages of war that are still fresh. In Horenka, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, gray apartment buildings stand deserted and broken windows and damage from Russian shells are a common sight – a legacy of some of the worst Russian atrocities during the early days of the war. Coming to the area was once unthinkable. But it has now become one of the stops of tours through the towns in Kyiv region that show visitors the devastation and the horrors of war, as they learn more about what happened here from those still living through it. Kyiv city express Mykola Panov/Alamy Stock Photo Related article Ukraine’s railways are still running after two years of war. Here’s how “We were very much against such tours in the first months of the de-occupation, in the first year of the de-occupation,” said Mariana Oleskiv, head of Ukraine’s State Agency for Tourism Development. “It was a rather traumatic experience for all the residents.” “But now we are already seeing a significant change. People are ready for the world to know about the heroism of Ukrainians, on the one hand, and the crimes of the Russians, on the other,” she said. Among those who have gone on such tours are members of international organizations, volunteers, diplomats, people involved in reconstruction efforts and anyone who wants to witness what unfolded here. Jean-Baptiste Laborde, a French student from Bordeaux, is also following the route. He’s accompanied by Svitozar Moiseiv, a guide and co-founder of a travel company behind some of the tours. “I’ve been following events since the war began,” Laborde said. “So I wanted to see for myself what happened there, the destructions, the Russian occupation.” The journey begins Horenka resident Ivan Bilotserkivets explains how his town was shelled in the first days of the invasion as Russia attacked Kyiv. Svitlana Vlasova/CNN Laborde and Moiseiv start their tour in Horenka. Standing not too far from one of the dilapidated apartment buildings, its entrance covered in red tape, its yard being inspected by a demining team and its innards exposed by bombardment, Moiseiv tells how Russian soldiers arrived here on February 24, 2022, and moved on to the big cities, including the capital. He describes what happened in the nearby villages of Horenka, Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka. The story is suddenly interrupted by a resident who hid in the basement of the building in the early days of the war. Ivan Bilotserkivets’ apartment was destroyed but he and all his neighbors were unharmed. The pensioner recounts how they watched Russian helicopters attempting to land at Hostomel airport, just a few kilometers away. He says locals were sure the violence would end in a few days. But the reality is that the full-scale war is now well into its third year. “In general, I have a positive view of the fact that people from all over the world come to see our house and the consequences of the war,” Bilotserkivets says. “It affects their perception of the war when people see the destruction with their own eyes.” From his pocket, he pulls out a drone photo of his home taken just days after it was hit and shows it to Moiseiv and Laborde. Ukraine's ski resorts have been busy this winter, mainly with locals seeking an escape from the violence of the Russian invasion.

Of course, I share our experience. There were people from the United States, Brazil, Portugal, from many countries.” For the locals, the most urgent issue is the restoration of their homes. Hopes of which were raised – then dashed – when world-famous graffiti artist Banksy arrived to paint a mural on one of the walls. “Banksy came here several times, and we served him borsch and donuts,” Bilotserkivets says. “We thought that this would somehow contribute to faster reconstruction. But because of his drawings, the opposite happened. Now we are waiting for a decision on what to do with them, whether they will be dismantled.” The reconstruction can’t start before that decision is made, he said. ‘Endless cemetery’ A few hundred meters away is another location of the tour, which links the history of Kyiv’s defence against the Nazi army during World War II and the story of a Ukrainian family’s survival during the Russian invasion in 2022. Moiseiv shows Laborde a section of a concrete fortification that was part of the Soviet army’s defences in the 1940s.

Svitlana Vlasova/CNN Moiseiv tells Laborde what happened in each of the settlements, how the landscape affected the Russian offensive. The Ukrainian army blew up bridges to stop the Russian advance, he explains, but that made it difficult for people to evacuate quickly as the invading army approached. “Frankly speaking, it is extremely unpleasant and difficult for me to actually be here every time I come here. Because, relatively speaking, we are moving through an endless cemetery,” Moiseiv says.

We will stop at the memorial to the shooting of young men. From a psychological point of view, this is a difficult process,” he says as the tour reaches Bucha, a town that has come to symbolize Russian atrocities around Kyiv. Moiseiv says he tries to show human suffering in a personalized way on his tours – damaged houses, holes in the fences of residents. “We know their names and we know what they did during the hostilities.” “Such tours are especially needed so that Europe and the whole world can help us more now, so that we can survive this cruel and absolutely inhuman struggle,” he says. Among the locations of the tour is also the Church of St Andrew in Bucha, where more than 100 bodies of civilians were buried in a single mass grave and then exhumed after the liberation of the town. Now there is a memorial at the gravesite. There are fresh flowers near some of the names, as relatives of the victims come to honor the memory of their loved ones. Laborde stops to read the names. Immersive tour Yulia Bevzenko has also been conducting tours in Kyiv for Ukrainians and foreigners for 10 years. Among her clients since the war began have been famous film stars and directors, politicians, foreign ambassadors and volunteers. She developed her “Kyiv is not Kiev” route to show how the capital lives during the war. “The tour is not about entertainment, it is an immersive tour,” she said. “We are not trying to distract their attention from the war. We are trying to immerse them in it.” Before the start of the war Bevzenko ran about four tours for visitors per week. In 2022, she gave four or five tours in English during the entire year, and the guests were not tourists in the true sense of the word.

Moiseiv, the tour guide travelling with the French student, also said pure tourism was almost non-existent after the start of the war, but in 2023 about 100 people visited Bucha with him.

Some of the locations that touched her the most were the destroyed Irpin bridge, around which people tried to escape to Kyiv from occupied towns like Bucha. Some were shot by the Russians. She also saw graves and the destroyed houses in Bucha. “Hearing about it and seeing it are very different things,” said Schröckeneder, who hosted Ukrainian children who had trouble reaching their parents still in the midst of conflict. “I saw the pain,” she said. “But if you see it yourself, I cannot describe how different it is.” A wall of remembrance at a church in Irpin.

And I think it’s very important for other people from Europe to see this.” While many countries, including the US, currently warn against all travel to Ukraine, it seems that a willingness to discover the realities of the conflict, continues to draw visitors across its borders. And with an eye on a post-war future, Mariana Oleskiv, the head of the State Agency for Tourism Development, says she hopes travelers will one day be able to return to Chernobyl. But, she adds, Ukraine’s recent experiences of conflict must remain at the heart of any travel experience. “It will also contain a part of the new history, including the defense of the Kyiv region, the trenches that (the Russians) dug in the ground contaminated with radiation.”"

The change would mark another significant shift in the Biden administration’s Ukraine policy , as the US looks for ways to give Ukraine’s military an upper hand against Russia. The policy is still being worked on by administration officials and has not received final sign-off yet from President Joe Biden , officials said. “We have not made any decisions and any discussion of this is premature,” said one administration official. “The president is absolutely firm that he will not be sending US troops to Ukraine.” Once approved, the change would likely be enacted this year, officials said, and would allow the Pentagon to provide contracts to American companies for work inside Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded in 2022. Officials said they hope it will speed up the maintenance and repairs of weapons systems being used by the Ukrainian military. Over the last two years, Biden has insisted that all Americans, and particularly US troops, stay far away from the Ukrainian frontlines. The White House has been determined to limit both the danger to Americans and the perception, particularly by Russia, that the US military is engaged in combat there. The State Department has explicitly warned Americans against traveling to Ukraine since 2022. As a result, US-provided military equipment that has sustained significant damage in combat has had to be transported out of the country to Poland, Romania, or other NATO countries for repairs, a process which takes time.  US troops are also available to help the Ukrainians with more routine maintenance and logistics, but only from afar via video chat or secure phone—an arrangement that has come with inherent limitations, since US troops and contractors are not able to work directly on the systems. Administration officials began to seriously reconsider those restrictions over the last several months, officials said, as Russia continued to make gains on the battlefield and US funding for Ukraine stalled in Congress. Allowing experienced, US government-funded American contractors to maintain a presence in Ukraine means they will be able to help fix damaged, high-value equipment much faster, officials said. One advanced system that officials say will likely require regular maintenance is the F-16 fighter jet, which Ukraine is set to receive later this year. Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop robust risk mitigation plans to mitigate threats to their employees, an official said. The discussions follow a series of decisions the US has made in recent months to try to help Ukraine beat back the Russians. In late-May, Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia, near the border with the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, with US weapons—a request the US had repeatedly denied in the past. Last week, that policy appeared to expand once again, when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine could counterstrike anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border using US weapons. Current and former officials familiar with the discussions about deploying contractors to Ukraine emphasized that the policy change will not result in the kind of overwhelming American contractor presence there that existed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, it would likely result in anywhere from a few dozen to a couple hundred contractors working in Ukraine at a time. “This would be a much more focused and thoughtful effort to support Ukraine in country,” said retired Army officer Alex Vindman, who served as the director for European Affairs on former President Donald Trump’s National Security Council. Vindman has been pushing the administration to lift the restrictions for nearly two years and said the administration has been working on a plan to ease the restrictions since earlier this year. “Ukraine is an ally,” Vindman told CNN. “The US has keen, critical national security interests in supporting Ukraine, and there are plenty of risk mitigation measures.”"

But neither country will join the bloc soon","Formal negotiations between Ukraine and Moldova on joining the European Union begin on Tuesday, a landmark moment for the two former Soviet-bloc countries that marks the start of a long, drawn-out process.","Jun 25, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Luke McGee,Ukraine,"CNN — Formal negotiations between Ukraine and Moldova on joining the European Union begin on Tuesday, a landmark moment for the two former Soviet-bloc countries that marks the start of a long, drawn-out process. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X: “Congratulations to Moldova and Ukraine on opening accession negotiations. This is very good news for the people of Ukraine, Moldova, and the entire European Union. The path ahead will be challenging but full of opportunities.” The two nations first applied to join the EU in 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the bloc has been broadly supportive of Ukraine and sent over $100 billion, according to EU figures , the path to joining the EU for either country will  be far from smooth. Hungary, Russia’s main ally within the EU, has dragged its feet on a number of issues concerning Ukraine, including military and financial aid. In December of last year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would block Kyiv’s bid to begin accession talks. He eventually dropped his objections , however, Orban will still have plenty of opportunities to frustrate Ukraine. The path to EU membership requires candidate to meet a set of criteria before entering into detailed chapters of negotiation – known as the chapters of the acquis – covering a range of issues, from economic standards to rule of law. There are 35 chapters in total, all of which must be agreed by all negotiating parties, including the 27 EU member states. The process of opening, negotiating and closing all 35 chapters is expected to take over a decade for both Moldova and Ukraine. Further to this, neither country has yet to meet the criteria to even reach this stage of the negotiations. Meeting the criteria is particularly complicated for Ukraine, as it is virtually impossible to meet the standards required while under invasion and at war. Moldova, too has domestic difficulties, with the self-declared Moldovan independent state of Transnistria seeking alliance with Russia while the rest of the country turns to Europe. Transnistria is internationally still recognized as part of Moldova, but it is not implausible that some will see this as a reason the country cannot join the EU while the matter is unresolved. Practical and technical negations aside, there is also a political dimension to this that is likely to complicate negations. Expanding the bloc to the east of Europe will have consequences for the rest of the EU member states. It is likely both Ukraine and Moldova will be net recipients of the EU budget. That makes it a harder sell for all the existing EU nations, as their spending will go up and their overall share of the budget will fall. There will also be implications for industry. Ukraine, for example, has already run into trouble with European partners over its agricultural industry. Poland, one of the most consistent supporters of Ukraine in its war effort, temporarily banned Ukraine from exporting grain into the country because it was harming Polish farmers. The spat escalated, with Poland suspending its military support for Ukraine. Perhaps more importantly, accepting Ukraine and Moldova to the bloc would mean adding around 40 million new EU citizens from Eastern Europe. This means giving freedom of movement within the bloc to many people who might want to escape what has recently been a war zone. It would also shift the balance of power within the EU further to the east. While there are no hard and fast rules about which member states align on which issues, it is broadly reasonable to say that the eastern countries have different political views to southern and Western European countries. That could mean some existing EU member states will slow down and frustrate the process unless certain safeguards are put in place protecting their own privileged positions within the bloc. The start of negotiations is a big moment for those hoping to join the bloc to they can move further away from Russian influence and into the EU yolk. But in reality, these opening talks are mostly symbolic and there is still a long way to go before either country becomes a full member state."

That is why we are providing assistance to print more than three million textbooks for Ukrainian elementary school students ahead of this school year.” “Our message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia’s barbaric war of aggression,” he said. The roughly $8 million in funding for the textbook printing comes as the Biden administration has adjusted its policies in an effort to fortify Ukraine’s military fight against Russia. The administration has shifted its policy to allow US weapons to be used in strikes into Russian territory where Russian forces are engaging in cross-border attacks into Ukraine – a change that was first publicly acknowledged in late May as Ukraine worked to push back Russian advances toward the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The administration is also prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries. “This all kind of fits together in terms of helping the Ukrainian military to defend its skies but also helping to ensure that Ukraine is able to educate its students and its children,” a senior administration official said. “It’s not enough to just support their military. Of course, we’re doing that,” the official told CNN. “But we also recognize that Russia is trying to do something broader than that, which is target Ukraine’s culture and history and identity and we need to respond to that as well.” In late May, Ukraine’s largest printing facility, Faktor Druk, was hit in a Russian missile attack on Kharkiv. The US assessed that it will take six to eight months for Ukraine to repair Faktor Druk, according to the official. The day after the attack, in a daily internal meeting on Ukraine, Sullivan directed his team to address the fallout from the strike, making it “an urgent priority” for the US to help ensure that the educational materials make it to the Ukrainian students, the official told CNN. After coordination between the National Security Council, US Embassy in Kyiv, US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ukrainian government, it was decided that by “using existing resources and programs” the US, through USAID, will provide roughly $8 million to fund the printing of the textbooks, the official said. “We really focused in on hardcover textbooks for first and second graders in Ukraine as an area where they identified the most urgent need, and working with them to identify facilities where these materials can be prepared and printed,” the official said. “So we really sprang into action in that regard and also sprang into action to allocate supplemental resources to go toward this initiative.” The 3.2 million textbooks will be manufactured at other Ukrainian printing houses in time for the start of the school year in September 2024, the official described. They will be distributed “to approximately 12,700 schools throughout Ukraine,” they added. The Ukrainian Ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, called the funding for printing the textbooks “extremely timely and very much valued by the people of Ukraine.” “It is especially important that funding will be provided to Ukrainian printing houses. It is another investment in our future, and our fight for justice and humanity,” she said in a statement to CNN. “Like so much needed support with defense and weapons, this is yet another sign of strong strategic friendship between our nations. As President Zelensky said: ‘the partnership between Ukraine and US is strong and unwavering.’”"

The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine carried out the attack using “US-supplied ATACMS operational-tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads.” Four missiles were shot down by Russian air defense but another “deviated from its flight trajectory in the final section due to the impact of air defenses, with the warhead exploding in the air over the city,” the post added. Video footage posted on X shows the aftermath of the strike, with wounded civilians seen being carried from the beach in stretchers before being loaded into vehicles. Beachgoers, some of them still in their swimwear, can be seen evacuating the area. One of victims killed in the Ukrainian strike was the daughter of Oleg Averyanov, Deputy Mayor of Magadan.

According to eyewitnesses on the ground, there was no air raid siren which warned of the attack. Many local residents also took to the comment section of official posts to express their dissatisfaction about the air raid siren not alerting them to an incoming attack. In response to Ukraine’s attack on Sevastopol, the Russian Ministry of Defense said “such actions will not go unanswered,” saying responsibility for the attack lied with Washington. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with Sevastopol authorities, adding that the Russian government’s priority is to provide all necessary assistance to victims, RIA says. Ukraine has not officially commented on the attack, but CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for a comment. Crimea has been occupied by Russia since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, it has come under sporadic attack from Ukrainian forces. Kyiv has previously insisted that its strikes on Crimea, which have targeted Russian naval bases and vessels, are an integral part of their strategy, intended to try to isolate the peninsula and make it more difficult for Russia to sustain its military operations on the Ukrainian mainland, a Ukrainian source familiar with the strategy told CNN last year. Before Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sevastopol – the largest city in Crimea – was a popular tourist destination for Russians. Even after the outbreak of war, Russians have continued to flock to the coastal city despite the dangers."

Farage – who heads the fast-growing Reform UK political party and was a pivotal figure in in Brexit – is seeking to win a seat in parliament for the first time in next month’s general election. During an interview with the BBC Friday, Farage was asked if he stood by a tweet posted in February 2022 which called Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine a “consequence of EU and NATO expansion.” “Why did I say that? It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Putin] a reason to his Russian people to say they’re coming for us again, and to go to war,” he told the BBC’s Nick Robinson. “We’ve provoked this war – of course it’s his fault – he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse,” he said.

That’s standing behind Ukraine but also standing up for our freedom,” he said. “These are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation’s security,” wrote John Healey, a Labour MP and shadow Defence Secretary.

These are not the first rolling blackouts since Russia’s full-scale invasion, but they are the first to happen in the spring and early summer – traditionally the months with lowest electricity demand before air-conditioning season kicks in – underscoring the scale of the supply problem. In the early hours of Thursday morning, Ukraine endured the seventh massive Russian attack on its energy facilities since March 22 this year. Ukrenergo, the state-owned grid operator, reported damage in four regions. Seven energy workers were injured, and previously scheduled power outages extended. On Saturday, “massive” Russian missile attacks hit several Ukrainian energy facilities, leaving thousands without power, officials said. In the Zaporizhzhia region, two power engineers were injured and the energy facility was damaged overnight, according to Ivan Fedorov, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration. Ukraine’s energy grid has been firmly in the crosshairs of Russian missiles since the war began but this year Moscow began specifically targeting power generation facilities – thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations, even energy storage facilities – a marked shift in tactics from the previous winter, when the attacks were less precise, and the damage easier to repair. Experts say Russia has been using better weaponry and taking advantage of thin Ukrainian air defenses. At Ukraine’s reconstruction conference in Berlin in mid-June, President Volodymyr Zelensky laid out the scale of the destruction from the first six attacks. “Russian missile and drone strikes have already destroyed 9 GW of capacity, while the peak energy consumption in Ukraine last winter was 18 GW. So, half of it does not exist anymore,” he said. Officials and energy executives are now acknowledging there is no way to avoid blackouts this winter. The mission now is simply to minimize them. “If we don’t restore the existing the damaged plants, if we don’t improve the interconnector capacity for input, if we don’t build these distributed generators, at least in some places… then people will have power for less than four hours per day,” says Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company. “We have 120 days left before the start of the heating season,” he warns. “It cannot be business as usual.” People stand at a fast-food stall in Kyiv during a partial blackout. Thomas Peter/Reuters Outages have been part of Ukrainian life following Russia's full-scale invasion but they are now happening in spring and early summer. Yan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images Ukraine is trying to tackle the problem in a variety of ways. As well as rebuilding what they can, in some cases using parts from decommissioned power plants in Europe, officials and energy companies are trying to secure as many generators and gas turbines as possible to support critical infrastructure through the winter, and are working with European partners to increase imports of electricity. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was a net exporter of electricity, and had even been able to resume some exports during wartime. That stopped in March. “We are doing our best,” Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk told CNN. “We understand that without energy it will be very difficult to survive.” When supply-side efforts fall short, all that’s left is to reduce demand. And that means asking for even more sacrifice from the already blackout-weary Ukrainian people. “We asked our people… to be ready to understand the situation, to support Ukraine, to support our energy workers,” says Grynchuk. “We call it the second front line, energy.” At the end of April, a few weeks after a Russian attack destroyed the Kyiv region’s biggest power plant, Andrii Buzovskyi, a 52-year-old Kyiv police officer, spent about $1,400 on two solar panels for his balcony. “I installed them so that my family would not feel uncomfortable when there is no electricity,” he told CNN. “What will happen next is unknown.” The government would like to see more of this. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal just announced new grants to help housing cooperatives invest in solar panels and heat pumps. Ukraine’s central bank is also working to make loans for households and businesses to buy energy-related equipment more affordable.

The government is incentivizing solar energy in response to the Russian barrage. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images A thermal power plant badly damaged in a Russian strike. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters The chief executive of supermarket chain Auchan Ukraine, Marta Trush, told CNN that while all its stores are already equipped with generators, it has modernized its refrigerators to save energy and reduced its range of products with short sell-by dates. Some of that has the added incentive of mitigating soaring costs. “The operation of the entire network on diesel generators is about three times more expensive than from the central power grid,” said Trush. “So, to save electricity in the sales areas, we reduce lighting and temporarily restrict access to refrigerators, but we see how customers are understanding of the forced measures.” Power outages have a clear inflationary effect, said Igor Piddubnyi, a researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics. “Companies have to have to somehow get back-up power supply and they are… buying the diesel generators, solar panels, etcetera…and it increases the cost of production,” he told CNN. Ukraine’s inability to export electricity also upsets its balance of trade, he says, which feeds into inflation. The National Bank of Ukraine estimated in May that economic growth will slow to 3% this year, from 5.3% in 2023, mostly because of the damage to the energy sector. Inflation is expected to rise slightly to 8.2%. And while Russia is experiencing a wartime uplift for its labor force, with unemployment at record lows, Piddubnyi said evidence shows power outages are forcing Ukrainian companies to lay off workers. The central bank still expects unemployment to fall this year, but only to 14% from the current level of 15%.

That’s the equivalent of the entire hard-won loan backed by the profits of frozen Russia assets Ukraine was recently promised, but it may not see that money for months.  The G7, having already spent $3bn to date to support Ukraine’s energy sector, just announced another $1bn in funding in early June. And Piddubnyi points out that calculating the true cost of rebuilding, while attacks continue, is impossible. “There is a clear uncertainty of how many more power plants will be destroyed by Russians,” he said. Ukraine’s energy ministry says it has been building concrete shelters to protect some energy equipment from attacks. But more advanced air defense systems are the only way to protect entire power plants and prevent the reconstruction bill from spiraling higher. In the wake of Thursday’s attack, Kyiv’s intensive lobbying efforts finally looked to be paying off. Romania agreed, after months of deliberation, to send a Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. And a senior White House official told CNN that Ukraine was being given top priority for US shipments of advanced air defense capabilities, ahead of some other countries. Those deliveries should start this summer. Sakharuk, who spoke to CNN before the seventh wave of strikes on energy facilities on June 20, said he would like to see deliveries of air defense munitions specifically to protect energy facilities. He admits keeping up morale among employees is a major challenge. “They see that they are in a type of cycle where they repair an energy facility and Russia finds out that it’s being repaired, and (it is) again destroyed.” “In some cases, the workers did this three to four times already.” CNN’s Clare Sebastian wrote and reported from London, and Olga Voitovych reported from Kyiv.

Putin’s remarks, at the end of a state visit to Vietnam, capped off a week in which Moscow sought to rattle the West and project strength from a part of the world in which his influence still carries weight. “Those who supply these weapons believe that they are not at war with us. I said, including in Pyongyang, that we then reserve the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world,” Putin told reporters Thursday at the end of his trip to Hanoi, in response to a question on whether the supply of Western long-range weapons could be considered an act of aggression. “Where they will go next?” he said, suggesting those countries could then sell the weapons to Western adversaries. The US called Putin’s remarks “incredibly concerning” in a briefing on Friday. “It would destabilize the Korean Peninsula,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters, and “depending on the type of weapons they provide, might violate UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself has supported.” Russia and North Korea’s signing of a mutual defense pact this week sent ripples out across the region, with South Korea summoning Moscow’s envoy on Friday, and Japan and the United States voicing serious concern.

KCNA/Reuters Related article Putin and Kim seen laughing in Russian-made limousine after inking mutual defense pact The defense pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin’s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. The deal was inked on Wednesday during Putin’s trip to Pyongyang, where he received a lavish welcome from fellow autocrat Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader. It consolidates the Kim regime’s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council and means Russia now has a defense pact with South Korea’s biggest enemy. South Korea, a US ally, condemned the treaty and summoned Russia’s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. First Vice Minister Kim Hong-kyun relayed the South Korean government’s “stern position” on Kim and Putin’s defense pact, urging Moscow to “immediately halt military cooperation” with Pyongyang and abide by UN Security Council resolutions, the Foreign Ministry said. Kim told the Russian ambassador that “any cooperation that could directly or indirectly help reinforce the North Korean military power is a violation of the UN Security Council resolution,” adding that Russia, a permanent member of the UNSC, should “act responsibly,” according to the ministry. An official of the US military, which maintains almost 30,000 troops in South Korea, told CNN the closer Russia-North Korea ties were troubling. “These developments should concern any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, abiding by UN Security Council resolutions, and supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal invasion,” the military official said. New threats Putin flew to Vietnam on Thursday where he renewed threats towards both Western powers and their partners in Asia. Speaking to Russian journalists at the end of the visit he accused NATO of “creating a threat” for Russia in Asia. “And we see what’s happening in Asia, right? The bloc system is being cobbled together in Asia. NATO is already moving there as a permanent place of residence. This, of course, creates a threat for all countries in the region, including the Russian Federation. We are obliged to respond to this and will do so,” Putin said. Putin warned South Korea on Thursday it would be making “a very big mistake” if it decided to supply arms to Ukraine, claiming Seoul has “nothing to worry about” concerning the new strategic partnership signed by Russia and North Korea. “As far as I know, the Republic of Korea does not plan aggression against the DPRK, which means there is no need to be afraid of our cooperation in this area,” he said.

US and South Korean forces hold regular exercises and training in and around the Korean Peninsula, and the two allies have been working more closely with Japan, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. National Security Director Chang Ho-jin said South Korea would review the issue of arms provision to Ukraine, but he also noted that Seoul was willing to wait for the Russian government’s explanation of the results of the meeting between Putin and Kim Jong Un. Currently, South Korea’s policy is not to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine. When later asked about those comments, Putin said: “As for the supply of lethal weapons to the combat zone in Ukraine, this would be a very big mistake. I hope that this will not happen. If this happens, then we will also make appropriate decisions, which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea.” Ukrainian soldiers with the 57th Motorized Brigade operate at an artillery position on June 9, 2024 near Vovchansk, Kharkiv Region, Ukraine.

In the letter to UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis on Thursday, the assocation describes it as “shameful joint chanting by fans of both national teams, which was directed against the Serbian nation as a whole.” The chant, the Serbian association said, was “kill, kill, kill the Serb.” The General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, Jovan Šurbatović, also threatened to pull the Serbia team out of the tournament, according to Serbia state broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia (RTS/PTC) in comments published on Wednesday evening. “What happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition,” Šurbatović said, according to RTS. On Thursday, UEFA said it had appointed an inspector “to conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters” during Croatia’s game against Albania. Serbia played its second Group C match in Euro 2024 against Slovenia earlier on Thursday, drawing 1-1 to keep alive its chances of qualifying for Euro 2024’s knockout stages. Albania and Croatia drew 2-2 in their match Wednesday. Serbia kept its hopes alive of reaching the knockout stages with a draw on Thursday. Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images Animosity between Croatian and Albanian fans towards Serbia stems from the 1990s and the Balkan conflicts and are generally seen as being ethnic and political grievances. The issues include a focus around the issue of Kosovo, a former autonomous province of Serbia but has majority ethnic Albanians. In the letter posted online by the Football Association of Serbia it asked UEFA, the governing body of European football, to “punish those responsible” for their actions and reminded the organization “that this kind of rampage, hatred and racism represent everything that your organization is fighting against.” The letter also details the exact time the chant was reportedly heard – the 58th minute – and accused an unnamed Albanian player of using a megaphone after the game of “inflaming” the crowd using the same chant. The Croatian Football Federation told CNN that, as far as it was aware, its fans were not involved in any racist or discriminatory chants during the match against Albania, and said it was not mentioned in the UEFA delegate’s report. CNN has contacted the Albanian soccer federation for comment on the Football Association of Serbia’s letter. On Thursday, UEFA also said it was also investigating the “alleged inappropriate behaviour” of Albania’s forward Mirlind Daku. It did not specify if this was the player Serbia referred to in its letter. Since the beginning of the tournament last week, the Serbian and Albanian soccer associations have each been fined by UEFA for fan incidents. UEFA said they have fined the Albanian Football Association for four incidents at their opening match versus Italy – lighting off fireworks, throwing objects, pitch invasion and “transmitting provocative messages not fit for a sports event.” In total, Albania was fined 37,375 euros (approximately $40,000) for the incidents. Following Serbia’s 1-0 loss to England on Sunday, the Kosovar Football Association submitted a request to UEFA for a banner and chants reportedly sung by Serbian fans at its match. The statement called the chants “chauvinistic and racist.” UEFA has fined Serbia for fans “transmitting a provocative message not fit for a sports event” and throwing of objects. Both of which resulted in a total 14,500 euro (approximately $15,500) fine. Serbia vs. Slovenia Serbia scored a dramatic stoppage-time equalizer to draw 1-1 against Slovenia on Thursday, a result which keeps its Euro 2024 dreams very much alive. Luka Jović’s header in the 95th minute of the match sparked frenzied scenes inside Munich’s Allianz Arena, a goal which also denied Slovenia its first ever win at a European Championships. Žan Karničnik had seemingly won the game for Slovenia after his second-half strike, but Serbia kept playing until securing its dramatic equalizer in the very last passage of play. The result means Serbia sits bottom of Group C on one point, with Slovenia in second with two points."

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told PBS News on Monday that the agreement with Ukraine to fire into Russia extends wherever Russian forces are attempting to invade. “It extends to anywhere that Russian forces are coming across the border from the Russian side to the Ukrainian side to try to take additional Ukrainian territory,” Sullivan said, adding that it’s “not about geography. It’s about common sense.” Pentagon spokesman Maj. Charlie Dietz said in a statement that the US “has agreed to allow Ukraine to fire US-provided weapons into Russia across where Russian forces are coming to attempt to take Ukrainian territory.” “If Russia is attacking or about to attack from its territory into Ukraine, it only makes sense to allow Ukraine to hit back against the forces that are hitting it from across the border,” Dietz said. Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder insisted on Thursday that there had been no change in policy, which was always meant to allow Ukraine to conduct cross-border counterstrikes where necessary. But Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin suggested during a press conference last week at a NATO meeting that the policy was limited to the Kharkiv region. “Ukraine requested permission to conduct counter-fire in the Kharkiv area using US weapons, and President Biden granted them permission to do that…but the ability to conduct counter-fire in this close fight in the Kharkiv region is – is what this is all about.” The change marks a significant shift in the limited nature of the agreement between the US and Ukraine. President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission in May to conduct limited strikes inside Russia with US-provided weapons, but restricted it primarily to the border in the Kharkiv region after Russian forces launched a renewed offensive there. Last week, a senior US Defense Department official left the door open for a change of policy, telling reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels there have been “a number of areas” where the US has given the green light on policies it had previously been reluctant to approve. “[I]f you look back over the course of the conflict, you can find a number of areas where we were reluctant to do something, and then we did it,” the official said. “So F-16s, ATACMS. DPICMS, whatever it is. So there’s always a constant conversation and reassessment of what the right answer is, and I think that’s healthy. So never say never.” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also called for allowing Ukraine more flexibility to fire into Russia, saying last week that Ukraine “has the right to strike military targets on Russian territory.” Stoltenberg was asked specifically about the Ukrainians being allowed to use F-16s to fire into Russian territory or airspace when their training on the jets is complete. “Russia opened a new front, they opened the front in the north in Kharkiv, where they’re attacking directly from Russian territory just over the border. The border and the front line is more or less the same,” Stoltenberg said. “And of course, if the Russian forces, the artillery, the missile batteries were safe as soon as they were on the Russian side of the border, it would become extremely difficult for Ukrainians to defend themselves.” “So I’ll not go into every operational aspect of this, but I’ll only say that Ukraine has the right to strike military targets on Russian territory to the right for self-defense, and we have the right to support them in defending themselves,” he said. The US has said Ukraine is able to use their US-provided air defense systems to shoot Russian planes out of Russian airspace if they are preparing to fire into Ukrainian airspace. “There’s never been a restriction on the Ukrainians shooting down hostile aircraft, even if those aircraft are not necessarily in Ukrainian airspace,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said this month. “I mean, they can shoot down Russian airplanes that pose an impending threat. And they have. They have since the beginning of the war.”"

A senior White House official described the action as a “rather extraordinary” policy adjustment at a critical moment for Ukraine. The deliveries to Ukraine will begin this summer, and it is not immediately clear how many countries are impacted. Prior to the decision, Ukrainian officials had clearly explained to the Biden administration that additional air defenses were critically needed as Russia continued its aerial assaults against its cities and civilian infrastructure. “If we didn’t do this for Ukraine, they would not have been able to maintain their critical air defense stockpile heading into the winter, period,” the official said. “This is a decision that’s being made to ensure that they’re able to defend themselves against these relentless Russian missile and drone attacks.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked President Joe Biden for the move later on Thursday. “I am deeply grateful to @POTUS [President of the United States] and the United States for prioritising Ukraine in the delivery of air defenses that we critically need to defeat Russian attacks,” Zelensky said in a post on X . “The partnership between Ukraine and the United States is strong and unwavering. Together, we are protecting life against terror and aggression,” Zelensky added. Putting Ukraine at the top of the list to begin receiving “sufficient quantities” of these critical air defense capabilities – specifically the Patriot and NASAM interceptors – means that the US slid down other countries that were already in the queue to receive the weapons, the sources said. State Department and Pentagon officials are engaged in an “intensive diplomatic effort” to inform the affected countries that they will receive the interceptors on delayed timelines, the White House official said. Ukraine is expected to get its first exports of the air defense capabilities this summer and the policy change will stay in place for 16 months, the official said. The other countries will then get the interceptors they ordered. Late last week, Pentagon and State Department officials briefed congressional leadership on the policy change, but refused to tell them which countries would be impacted, creating frustration. That information has yet to be shared with Congress, sources said. The White House official would not share the list of affected countries, other than to say that air defense exports to Taiwan would not be impacted. “So far, at least in the private discussions, many of these countries have understood and appreciated the necessity of this decision,” the official said. “If any of our partners were in an existential situation like the one that Ukraine is in right now, we would move heaven and earth to help them and it just so happens that right now that country is Ukraine.” The change is the latest shift from the Biden administration to ensure that Ukraine can continue to defend itself in the face of Russia’s ongoing assault. Last month, Biden gave permission to Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with American munitions, breaking from long-standing US policy – though he restricted their use. The move is being done in parallel with Biden administration efforts to get Ukraine more air defense systems as well, a second White House official said. It also comes as the Biden administration adapts its policy approach to the conflict to account for evolving battlefield needs, and as NATO and the G7 are shoring up assistance to Ukraine amid uncertainty over November’s US presidential election. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has threatened to cut US support for Ukraine, and the country’s war effort was seriously hindered when Republicans in Congress stalled a major military aid package for months until it was eventually passed in April. Monthslong effort in the making The idea to adjust the global list was first raised internally by national security adviser Jake Sullivan in mid-April when Russia was intensifying its air campaign against Ukraine and Congress had not yet passed a supplemental defense package with aide for the country. Around the same time, a lack of air defenses meant Ukraine was powerless to prevent a Russian airstrike that destroyed the biggest power plant in Kyiv region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. The Pentagon proposed options after months of internal processes to examine how the change could be made. The plan to put Ukraine at the top of the list was finalized in late May. “Our message to Russia is that if they think they can outlast Ukraine in this war, they’re mistaken,” the official said, adding, “we are now effectively mobilizing our defense industrial capacity in order to get air defense interceptors that are rolling off the line straight to Ukraine, which will provide them with sufficient quantities to be able to defend against Russian air missile attacks for the foreseeable future.” Biden shared the news with Zelensky last week when they met on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy, the official said. The pair also announced that the US and Ukraine had signed a bilateral security pact that commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.

Journalist Aydos Sadykov, head of the opposition online media BӘCE and strong critic of the government of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, is in hospital after a gunman ran to his car on Tuesday, shot him and fled, according to the Office of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General. “Today in Kyiv, near his own house, an attempt was made on Aydos Sadykov’s life,” Sadykov’s wife, Natalya Sadykova, who was also in the car, said in a Facebook post after the assault. Kazakhstan is ruled by autocrat Tokayev, who has previously adopted violent methods to maintain order. In 2022, he faced the biggest challenge to his leadership when public anger over a spike in fuel prices erupted into wider protests over corruption, unemployment and poverty in the oil-rich former Soviet nation. To squash the unrest, Tokayev ordered security forces to “kill without warning.” Law enforcement officers are working to identify Sadykov’s attacker, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office said Wednesday. “The attempted murder took place in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the capital near the house where the couple live,” it said. “The man is currently in hospital in serious condition.” Sadykov and his wife, also a journalist, have been living in Ukraine since 2014 and have “refugee status,” the Prosecutor General’s Office said. In another Facebook post on Wednesday, Sadykova said the shooting was “brutal” and “cynical,” and happened “in broad daylight” in front of witnesses. “This happened when Aydos drove into the yard of our house. I was sitting next to him in the passenger seat,” she said. “Now Aydos has been operated on, he is in intensive care in serious condition. Please pray that he survives.” Sadykova accused President Tokayev of being behind the assassination attempt and said her husband “has always defended the interests of the Kazakhs.” CNN has reached out to Natalya Sadykova for further comment."

Read more CNN Opinion. CNN — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to North Korea this week kicks up yet another gust in the recent swirl of diplomatic activity surrounding Russia’s all-out war against Ukraine. Frida Ghitis CNN But unlike the dizzying number of summits of the past few weeks, this gathering of dictators in Pyongyang is meant to help Moscow – not Kyiv. In recent weeks, Ukraine’s supporters – led by the US and other Western democracies – have held multiple meetings, offering not only symbolic backing but also very concrete new assistance to besieged Ukrainians. So, it’s hardly surprising that Putin is pushing against his diplomatic isolation and seeking to invigorate his weapons pipeline ; the main purposes of his visiting the North Korean capital he has not seen in nearly a quarter of a century . The timing of all this stepped-up diplomacy, and of renewed efforts to squeeze concrete results beyond declarations of enduring support, is not a coincidence. A seemingly unrelated process unfolding thousands of miles away is fueling the increasing urgency. On both sides of the conflict, world leaders are keeping a wary eye on the calendar. With each gathering, summit, historical commemoration, the day draws nearer to what is arguably the most important event of 2024 – the US presidential election, in which one of the candidates has indicated he disapproves of the scale of Washington’s support for Ukraine and intends to cut it. That, of course, is former President Donald Trump. And the expectation that he would withdraw support for Kyiv is a key reason why, in three separate summit meetings in as many weeks, Kyiv’s friends have made strides toward Trump-proofing Ukraine’s defenses. The outcome of the US election will have profound implications for American foreign policy and potentially for the future of Ukraine, now in its third year of defending against an effort by Putin’s Russia to subjugate it by force. Frida Ghitis The outcome of the US election will have profound implications for American foreign policy and potentially for the future of Ukraine, now in its third year of defending against an effort by Putin’s Russia to subjugate it by force. The allies have good reason to believe Putin aims to outlast Western support . Putin – who along with his friends in Iran, Russia, China and North Korea, would like to see an end to a global order led by the US and Western democracies – needs to secure enough weaponry to keep pushing into Ukraine for the coming months. Part of his plan is probably to maintain the pressure until the public in Western countries grows tired of supporting Kyiv, and their rightist leaders – perhaps Trump in the White House and other like-minded ones in Europe – pull the rug out from under Ukraine. That line of thinking was likely behind last week’s port call in Cuba by a Russian nuclear-powered submarine , and a “peace” proposal by Putin, both aimed at persuading Western audiences that the risk is too high and it’s time to let Putin get at least some of what he wants. Under Putin’s proposal, he wouldn’t get all of Ukraine; instead suggesting he’d be happy to keep a few large chunks of the country, along with a number of provisions weakening Kyiv.

From the escarpments of France’s Normandy, where Western allies came together earlier this month to commemorate the 80thanniversary of the D-Day invasion against the Nazis, to the G7 summit in Italy’s Puglia region, to the Peace Summit in Switzerland this past weekend, scores of countries have voiced support for Ukraine, equating Russia to the reviled aggressors of previous wars. Many have backed their soaring rhetoric with significant steps of assistance. To be sure, Russia has secured massive support from its autocratic allies. South Korean intelligence estimates that North Korea has delivered as many as 5 million artillery rounds , along with ballistic missiles and other ammunition. That has undoubtedly helped Moscow kill countless Ukrainians and crush its energy infrastructure. Iran has provided kamikaze drones , and China is reportedly supplying the parts needed to convert Russia into a wartime economy (which they all deny.) But the West has also upped its game. The six-month delay in approving the Biden administration’s $61 billion aid package , blocked by Trump acolytes in Congress, allowed Russia to gain momentum . But the weapons are now flowing, helping slow Russia’s progress in some areas. In Normandy, Western leaders likened the war against Hitler to Ukraine’s cause , with Russia playing the part of WWII Germany – an analogy that both undercuts Putin’s false claim about Ukrainian Nazism and strengthens the rationale for helping Ukraine win. In Puglia, the G7 agreed to a massive $50 billion loan to Ukraine, financed with the earnings from Russia’s frozen assets. President Joe Biden called it a “vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war.” Notice the word “sustainable” – that’s the Trump-proofing part, or even the Republican-Congress-proofing piece, in case GOP hardliners again try to reverse US policy. Biden also signed a 10-year security agreement with Zelensky. The timeline outlasts even a possible second Biden term. “Our goal,”said Biden, is to strengthen Kyiv, “for the long term.” There’s that allusion to the calendar once again.

US and German officials have proposed that the alliance pledge during next month’s summit that Ukraine has a “bridge” to NATO membership, rather than an “irreversible path” as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in April in language that is favored by the UK and several Eastern and Central European nations, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. The eventual language issued by the alliance about Ukraine during July’s summit in Washington is critical. It will be painstakingly debated by the allies in the days leading up and then heavily scrutinized, as it will outline to the world – Russia in particular – what the goals are for Ukraine within NATO. “At the (Washington) Summit, we’ll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there’s a bridge to membership, a bridge that’s strong and well-lit,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a NATO Foreign Ministerial in Prague in late May. A senior US official said that Biden administration officials do not think the word “irreversible” would get the support of the entire alliance, pointing in particular to Hungary as a likely holdout. The official said the US believes they are close to a resolution with all allies on the language but declined to preview the decision. Some NATO members are also reluctant to use the word because Ukraine has yet to implement all of the necessary democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership, a separate US official said. With the summit about a month away, the topic remains a central point of tension in ongoing conversations. “Most Central European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration’s ambiguity and procrastination” when it comes to outlining a concrete pathway forward for Ukraine, a Central European diplomat told CNN. A second European official whose country is more aggressive on Ukraine’s membership than the US said that European allies have been directly lobbying the White House to make Ukraine’s pathway as clear as possible. “We instinctively feel a new path should be laid out,” the second official said. “Fast tracking [Ukraine’s membership] should be looked at.” In April, Stoltenberg told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv that “the work we are undertaking now puts you on an irreversible path towards NATO membership, so that when the time is right, Ukraine can become a NATO member straightaway.” Still, there is a general recognition that NATO’s position out of the summit needs to have advanced from last year’s meeting in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when the allies declared that “Ukraine’s future is in NATO” but didn’t offer a timeline. Members of the alliance announced at the time that they would remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine, making it easier for the country to join the alliance, but still declined to offer a timeline on how long that might take. That was met with fury by Zelensky who posted on X that it was “unprecedented and absurd” not to have been offered a timeline for membership. Vague commitment in 2008 It was back in 2008 at a NATO summit in Budapest that Ukraine was first offered a vague commitment of an invitation to join in the future. Ukrainians often invoke the lack of clarity dating back 16 years as an argument for deserving more, particularly when under attack by Russia. “I’m certain that we will also have language expressing that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance,” Stoltenberg said Tuesday at a news conference at the US State Department. “The exact language, exactly what we will agree … are now discussed among allies. But I’m confident we have a good solution, agreement by the summit.” The Biden administration has trumpeted its newly signed ten-year defense pact with Ukraine, which calls itself “a bridge to Ukraine’s eventual membership in the NATO Alliance.” But for many Europeans that doesn’t go far enough. “Of course we’d be for ‘irreversible,’” a third Eastern European official said. It’s “not a big secret we are eager to get more” than the US, the official added, adding they hope the US administration can remain “flexible” ahead of the formal meetings next month. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that peace talks would only begin with Ukraine if Kyiv officially gives up on its NATO aspirations. “As soon as Kyiv declares that it is ready for such a decision,” Putin said on Friday, “an order to cease fire and begin negotiations will immediately follow from our side, literally at the same minute.” A key component of NATO membership is a mutual defense pact known as Article V that commits NATO allies to defend any member that is attacked. Ukraine has been intensifying its push to join NATO since it was first attacked by Russia in 2014. Since the war in Ukraine began in 2022, Ukrainian and European officials have accused the US of being too afraid of provoking Putin and escalating the conflict. Ukraine has both been grateful and frustrated as it watched the US offer bigger and bigger weapons packages, but at a slower pace than it has needed. Last month Stoltenberg indirectly criticized the Biden administration for not allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to fire into Russia, which Ukrainians have said amounts to them fighting with one hand tied behind their back. “This is a war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine,” Stoltenberg told The Economist. “Ukraine has the right to defend themselves. And that includes striking targets on Russian territory.” On May 30 the Biden administration announced that Ukraine could fire into Russia but only in a limited way: at military targets across the border from the city of Kharkiv and not with the most formidable US weapons, the long-range ATACMS missile. London has often been much more forward-leaning than Washington on weaponry for Ukraine and how it’s used. Generally, throughout the conflict, British officials, the closest US allies in NATO, have consistently hoped the White House would take a more aggressive stance. Officials who CNN spoke with emphasized that when it comes to the NATO communique that no decisions have been made yet and the language is still actively under discussion ahead of the summit. “When the text is on the table and the countries start to negotiate we can see the full picture,” the Eastern European official said. “We are ready to negotiate; of course we would like to have it be as ambitious as possible.” CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/18/china/north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"Putin may need arms from North Korea’s Kim, but what is he willing to give in return?","As Russian President Vladimir Putin makes his first visit to North Korea in more than two decades this week, his focus is widely seen to be on securing ongoing support from the hermit nation for his grinding war in Ukraine.","Jun 19, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Simone McCarthy,Ukraine,"Hong Kong CNN — As Russian President Vladimir Putin makes his first visit to North Korea in more than two decades, his focus is widely seen to be on securing ongoing support from the hermit nation for his grinding war in Ukraine. Putin ramped up his outreach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year as his weapons stockpiles dwindled – and munitions and missiles have flowed from the country to Russia since a landmark summit between the two leaders in September, multiple governments say, even as both Pyongyang and Moscow deny the transfers. But while the leaders’ meeting in the globally isolated, Soviet-style capital of Pyongyang provides an opportunity for the two autocrats to discuss how to expand that cooperation, observers say it will have consequences far beyond the battlefield in Ukraine. Putin’s arrival in Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday local time for the two-day visit marks a significant step forward for a partnership founded on shared hostility to the West and its allies – one that empowers both leaders and deepens global fault lines. The two are expected to ink a new strategic partnership agreement, with Putin saying ahead of the visit that they would “shape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia,” according to the Kremlin.

Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik/Reuters “The relationship is not just about necessity,” said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula. “We are seeing the two states forge an increasingly concerted united front and alignment against the United States and the West.” These divisions were only underscored by the timing of the visit, which comes on the heels of Putin’s meeting with close ally Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month and after democratic leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) used a summit in Italy to again show their solidarity against Moscow’s war. It also comes as North Korea has railed against growing security cooperation between the US and its allies South Korea and Japan, raising concerns with its escalated rhetoric and ongoing tests to bolster an extensive illegal weapons program. It remains publicly unknown just what Pyongyang is receiving in return for its support for Russia’s war. But governments from Seoul to Washington will be watching closely for signs of how far the warring Russian leader, who in the past supported international controls on North Korea’s illegal weapons program, is willing to go to back Kim’s bellicose regime. North Korea launched its first spy satellite, the Malligyong-1, in November. KCNA/Reuters What do Russia and North Korea want from each other? In the months after Kim rode his armored train through the country’s Far East region for a landmark September summit with Putin, North Korean munitions appeared to pour into Russia – and be fired in its assault on Ukraine. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers – the equivalent of 260,000 metric tons of munitions or munitions-related material – from North Korea since September, according to a US statement in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also said in March. The weapons may be of lesser quality than Russia’s own, but have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles and keep pace with the weapons support Ukraine is receiving from the West, observers say. The arrangement may also enable North Korea to gain real-world intel on the functioning of its weaponry and help it ramp up exports more broadly. In an article published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing “unwavering support” for Russia’s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were “ready to confront the ambition of the collective West.” Putin is widely seen as set to use his visit, which Kim invited him to make last September, to secure ongoing support. Less is known about exactly what compensation Pyongyang has received so far in return. South Korean officials have said the North is receiving shipments of food and other necessities from Russia, and there is no shortage of needs for the sanctions-strapped economy, which in addition to food lacks fuel and raw materials – but also seeks to advance its space, missile and nuclear programs.

Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik/Reuters Related article Russia’s Putin arrives in North Korea for rare trip as anti-West alignment deepens Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite program during their September meeting, which took place, fittingly, at a rocket launch facility. There have since been signs that such assistance has taken place, including the successful launch of North Korea’s first military reconnaissance satellite the “Malligyong-1” weeks after the visit, following two failed attempts. Such satellites can help North Korea improve its ground-based military capabilities, for example enabling it to more accurately target opponents’ forces with its own missiles. United Nations member states are barred from directly or indirectly aiding North Korea’s missile programs as well as engaging in arms transfers with Pyongyang. But Kim is also eyeing access to know-how for a range of Russian advanced weaponry, experts say, as well as technology linked to uranium enrichment, reactor designs or nuclear propulsion for submarines. The North Korean leader sees his weapons programs as essential to the survival of his regime, according to analysts. “Kim Jong Un will be interested in asking the world from Russia, whether he’ll get that or not is another question,” said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington. It’s unlikely that Putin would be “too eager to necessarily initiate cooperation on those issues (nuclear related technologies) when there’s a long list of less sensitive technologies that the Russians can part with” like improving radar or surface-to-air missile systems, he said. When asked last week about Western concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang, a Kremlin spokesperson said the countries’ “potential for developing bilateral relations” was “profound” and “should not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.” The remains of an unidentified missile, which Ukrainian authorities claimed to be made in North Korea, is seen at a site of a Russian strike in Kharkiv, Ukraine on January 2. Sofiia Gatilova/Reuters/File ‘A tragic world’ However, any support from Putin – a leader of a UN Security Council permanent member state – is a significant boon for Kim, who is deeply isolated on the world stage. For Putin, too, the visit is an opportunity to send a signal, or a threat, that Russia is not alone. “Putin is highlighting that Russia has friends – and is propagating the idea that the war is not winnable for Ukraine because Russia will not run out of weapons,” said John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation non-profit in Washington. The Russian leader may also see the relationship with Kim as a way to raise the specter of nuclear war, exploiting “US and South Korean concerns about North Korea,” so that “Ukraine’s friends will compel it to seek a negotiated ‘solution’ on Russia’s terms,” Erath added. The United Nations Security Council Andrew Kelly/Reuters/File Related article Russia protects North Korea in the UN with veto of resolution to investigate sanction violations Putin laid out his peace conditions on Friday ahead of a Ukraine-backed international peace summit over the weekend that Russia did not attend. They included the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions – a position seen as nonstarter by Kyiv and its allies. And in his letter published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin framed the two countries as both facing down what he called US efforts to impose a “neocolonialist dictatorship” over the world. Observers agree that Putin is unlikely at this point to directly help North Korea’s nuclear program, as neither Putin nor his close partner Xi want to see nuclear confrontation in the region. But it’s also become clear that growing North Korea-Russia ties, as well as the widening chasm between Russia, China and the West, is impacting international efforts to control North Korea’s weapons program. Russia in March vetoed a UN resolution to renew an independent panel of experts investigating the country’s violations of Security Council sanctions. China abstained from the vote. Both countries in recent years have blocked movement in the council related to North Korea as they grew skeptical of US-backed sanctions. Deepening divisions today contrast collaboration in recent decades between Russia, China and the US, according to former US Ambassador to Russia and National Security Council official Michael McFaul. He pointed to his experiences during the former US President Barack Obama administration working on nonproliferation efforts related to North Korea and Iran. “(Then) we were cooperating with the Russians on both of these fronts … we were meeting, we had the same objectives … and the Chinese were with us on lockstep on both of those accounts,” McFaul said in a podcast last month hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. “Now look at where we’re at today, completely the opposite … we’re not cooperating at all on either of those accounts … that is a brand-new world and a tragic world.”"

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked at a press conference in Italy last week about whether China was selling Russia arms for use in the war. Biden, who was standing beside him, waited for Zelensky to say President Xi Jinping told him he would not do so, before delivering a parting shot and ending the event. “By the way, China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it. So, it is, in fact, helping Russia.” Russia's President Vladimir Putin is greeted by North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un during a welcoming ceremony at an airport in Pyongyang, North Korea June 19, 2024.

Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik/Reuters Related article Russia’s Putin to visit North Korea in rare trip as anti-West alignment deepens The comment appeared to signal a hardening tone toward Beijing following months of US warnings that it shouldn’t help its friends in Moscow over the war. NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg reinforced the tough new line during a visit to Washington Monday that included Oval Office talks with Biden. “Publicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he’s taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China’s fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,” Stoltenberg said at The Wilson Center. “At the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.” Concerns that America’s enemies are aiding Russia’s war effort are sure to grow with the impending trip by Putin to North Korea, which the Kremlin said would have a “very eventful” list of events, including with the isolated Stalinist state’s tyrannical leader Kim Jong Un. The idea of an anti-US front among Russia, China, North Korea and Iran has long preoccupied foreign policy experts in Washington. Up until recently, US intelligence agencies have assessed that differences between the uneasy partners make formal alliances unlikely. But all those powers have one big thing in common: a desire to thwart American goals and power. Each is also subject to a brutal autocratic regime that is threatened by the democracy that unites the US and its European and Asian allies. The announcement that Putin is headed to Pyongyang raised the state of alert in Washington and caused expressions of concern from across the government. In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress that Russia’s need to replenish its military supplies had forced it to grant “long-sought concessions” to North Korea. She did not specify the extent of the cooperation, but her comment sparked speculation that Moscow was offering nuclear or missile expertise. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell added to the intrigue last week when he said at a Stimson Center event that the North Koreans have embarked on a series of “provocative” actions including by supplying Russia with artillery and missiles. And he added: “We have a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia and they have had a substantial impact on the battlefield.” But the US doesn’t seem to know what Kim will get in return. “What is Russia going to provide in exchange to North Korea, hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products?” Campbell said. “We don’t know but we are concerned by that and are watching carefully.” He added: “The entire scope of the Russia/North Korea relationship is something we follow carefully and are concerned about.” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Monday that North Korea had unlawfully transferred dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to aid Russia’s war effort. “We have seen those munitions show up on the battlefield in Ukraine. So, we know that they are using DPRK ammunition to threaten Ukraine and kill Ukrainians,” he said. And White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said that while the US wasn’t concerned about Putin’s trip, it was looking to see whether it worsened security conditions in Ukraine and in Northeast Asia. “What we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries not just because of the impacts it’s going to have on the Ukrainian people, because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets, but because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean Peninsula.” Kirby added: “We’re certainly going to be watching that very, very closely.” Putin and Kim clearly know Washington is watching. In an article in North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the Russian leader wrote: “We highly appreciate the DPRK’s unwavering support for Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.” And he called the isolated state Russia’s “committed and like-minded supporter, ready to confront the ambition of the collective West.” This story has been updated with additional developments."

The stark warning, issued at the end of the annual Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy, comes as the United States is stepping up diplomatic efforts to convince Europe to adopt a tougher stance on China over its role in aiding Russia’s military-industrial complex. “China’s ongoing support for Russia’s defense industrial base is enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and has significant and broad-based security implications,” the G7 leaders said in the communique Friday. “We call on China to cease the transfer of dual-use materials, including weapons components and equipment, that are inputs for Russia’s defense sector.” The leaders also threatened further actions, including sanctions, to punish Chinese entities that they say are helping Russia circumvent Western embargoes. “We will continue taking measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia’s war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia’s acquisition of items for its defense industrial base,” the joint statement said, vowing to impose “restrictive measures to prevent abuse and restrict access to our financial systems.” American officials have accused China of helping Russia expand military manufacturing, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Moscow to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles . Beijing has refuted the allegation, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods. At a United Nations Security Council meeting about arms supply to Ukraine also on Friday, China’s envoy reiterated that defense, while accusing the US of using the war as “an excuse to smear China” and suppress its companies. The US and European Union have already slapped sanctions on Chinese companies, and this week, the US imposed fresh sanctions on China-based firms supplying semiconductors to Russia. “China does not supply weapons, but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it,” US President Joe Biden said at the summit on Thursday. “So it is, in fact, helping Russia.” The G7 statement came a day ahead of a Ukraine-backed peace summit in Switzerland, which China did not attend, citing the lack of representation from “both Russia and Ukraine.” Leaders of the G7 nations gathered in southern Italy this week, with boosting support for Ukraine top of the agenda. Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images The G7 is also taking a tougher stance on China’s economic policies, especially on the issue of industrial overcapacity, vowing to take actions against “unfair practices” to “level the playing field and remedy ongoing harm.” “We express our concerns about China’s persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive non-market policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity in a growing range of sectors, undermining our workers, industries, and economic resilience and security,” the joint communique said. The day before the summit, the EU announced additional tariffs on electric vehicles (EV) imported from China following a months-long investigation, over what it sees as Beijing’s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. Last month, the US also imposed new tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security – including EVs and clean-energy products. The G7 also voiced strong opposition to what it says are China’s unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China seas. “We continue opposing China’s dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries’ high seas freedom of navigation,” the joint statement said. “We express serious concern about the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine vessels.” In a statement Monday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs slammed the G7 position saying it “manipulated issues” and “slandered and attacked China.” “At present, the G7 has long deviated from the original intention of coordinating and stabilizing the international economic environment, and has increasingly become a political tool to maintain the hegemony of the United States and the West,” spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing. Its “weaponizing” of trade relations would “ultimately only shoot itself in the foot,” Lin added. This story has been updated with additional information."

India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trading relationships with Russia as members of the BRICS economic group, attended the weekend meeting but did not agree to sign the joint statement. The document reaffirmed the signatories commitment to “refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognized borders.” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists at a news conference alongside the leaders of the European Union, Ghana, Canada, Chile and Switzerland that it was “important that all participants of this summit support this Ukraine’s territorial integrity because there is will be no lasting peace without territorial integrity.” Michael Holmes speaks with Dr. Liana Fix, from the Council on Foreign Relations, about the Ukraine peace summit, and what a successful outcome would look like. Clipped From Video video Related video Volodymyr Zelensky looks for international support for peace plan More than 100 countries and organizations gathered at an idyllic lakeside resort near Lucerne to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan Zelensky first outlined late in 2022. That formula includes demands for a cessation of hostilities, the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine’s pre-war borders with Russia – terms Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to ever agree to. Among the high-level dignitaries in attendance were the leaders of Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. US Vice President Kamala Harris was also in attendance and used the occasion to announce a $1.5 billion aid package that would go toward humanitarian expenditures and help Kyiv rebuilt its battered infrastructure. “This high level attendance shows one thing. The world cares deeply about the war provoked by Russia’s aggression,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Despite the strong showing among Western democracies, there had been questions ahead of the event as to just how much could be accomplished given that neither Russia nor China, whose increasingly close trading relationship with Moscow has helped the Kremlin survive Western sanctions, were attending. The communique published on Sunday said that signatories had struck several other agreements. Among them were the principle that Ukraine to should be allowed its own nuclear power plants – including the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant – and that the Kremlin refrain from both the use of and the threat of using nuclear weapons. The sides also said that all children and civilians that were unlawfully displaced must be returned to Ukraine. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off, Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin’s own peace plan, which calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join NATO . While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions – Donetsk and Luhansk – in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who traveled with Harris to Switzerland, told reporters at the summit that Putin’s framework “defies basic morality.” “He (Putin) said, not only does Ukraine have to give up the territory Russia currently occupies, but Ukraine has to leave additional sovereign Ukrainian territory before Russia will negotiate. And Ukraine must disarm so that is vulnerable to future Russian aggression down the road. No responsible nation could say that is a reasonable basis for peace,” Sullivan said."

Heavy combat is underway at an aggregate plant on the northern edge of Vovchansk, according to military bloggers on both sides of the conflict. One Ukrainian squad commander, Stanislav Buniatov, known as Osman, described the situation in Vovchansk, east of Kharkiv and a few miles from the state border, as “difficult but controlled” and said Russian troops are “surrounded”. “Our guys are not losing their positions, occasionally conducting successful assaults, liberating positions and pushing the enemy back,” Buniatov said in a post on Telegram on Sunday. Russian forces began coming across the border in numbers last month in a multi-pronged assault that the Kremlin said was designed to create a buffer zone that would prevent the Ukrainians from striking Russian cities such as Belgorod. Ukrainian soldiers of the 42nd Separate Mechanized Brigade set up positions on the front line near Vovchansk on June 12, 2024. Viacheslav Ratynskyi/Reuters At first they took several villages close to the border and advanced to the edge of Vovchansk, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in September 2022 after being occupied for several months. DeepState – a Ukrainian monitoring group – says small groups of Russian soldiers have repeatedly attempted to secure the aggregate plant, but have been repelled by Ukraine forces. Suggesting that resupply to the Russian soldiers has become difficult, DeepState says that food and water are being delivered to them by drones.

But there will be no delegation from Moscow.,"Jun 15, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Tim Lister,Ukraine,"CNN — More than 100 countries and organizations have gathered for a major conference in Switzerland dedicated to setting out a path toward peace between Ukraine and Russia, but there will be no delegation from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is aiming to use the meeting, which is being held at a resort near Lucerne, to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan he first outlined late in 2022. Addressing the conference on Saturday, Zelensky said the proposal for ending the war would be submitted to Russia once it had been agreed by the other nations in attendance and there would then be a second peace summit, where “we can fix the real end of the war.” “The peace formula is inclusive, and we are happy to hear and work on all proposals, all ideas of what is really needed for peace and what is important to you dear friends,” Zelensky said. “I urge you to be as active as possible and I am proud all parts of the world, all continents are now represented at the peace summit,” he added. Most Western governments have sent representatives at a senior level. US Vice President Kamala Harris is attending and announced that Washington will supply Kyiv with an aid package of more than $1.5 billion to help the country rebuild its battered infrastructure and address humanitarian needs stemming from the conflict, according to a statement from the White House on Saturday. “This war remains an utter failure for Putin. I am here in Switzerland to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace,” Harris said.

However, China will not attend. It has said that any such meeting needs to be attended by both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky’s plan includes demands for a cessation of hostilites, the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine’s ﻿pre-war borders with Russia. It also calls for the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes. “Ukraine never wanted this war, it’s a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression of Russia. And the only one who wanted it was Putin,” Zelensky said. Russia has expressed little interest in agreeing to those terms and has shown no sign of compromise when it comes to the territorial issues. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off, Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin’s own peace plan, which Ukraine is unlikely to ever agree to.

While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions – Donetsk and Luhansk – in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Putin said later in the day that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, a hike from the 617,000 he reported during a end-of-year press conference in 2023. Zelensky responded in an interview with Italian television that “the fact that Putin says to give them part of our territories, occupied and unoccupied, speaks about several regions of our country, and he will stop (there), and there will be no frozen conflict.” “The messages are the same as Hitler’s,” said Zelensky “Putin understands that there will be a peace summit. That most of the world is on the side of Ukraine, on the side of life. And on the eve of the summit, amid air raid sirens, people being killed and missile attacks, he seems to be talking about some kind of ultimatum,” Zelensky added."

As well as withdrawing from the four occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Putin said Ukraine must demilitarize and that Western countries must lift their sanctions on Russia, which have damaged but not crippled its economy. While these conditions are more maximalist than those Putin has hinted at before, they represent Russia’s failure to achieve its original war aims, when Moscow believed it could capture Kyiv in days and the rest of Ukraine in weeks. Nearly 28 months later, Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed a decade ago.

But, in comments to the foreign ministry, Putin said Russia’s conditions for peace talks are “simple,” beginning with the total withdrawal of Ukraine’s troops from the entire territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow only controls these regions partially, but claimed the whole of each region was part of Russia’s territory in 2022. Putin stressed that Ukraine should surrender not just the territory on the Russian side of the frontline , which splices through each of these regions, but “the entire territory of these regions.” “As soon as they declare in Kyiv that they are ready for such a decision and begin the real withdrawal of troops from these regions – and also officially notify about the abandonment of plans to join NATO – our side will immediately, at the same minute, make the order to cease fire and begin negotiations,” he said. Putin promised to “guarantee the unhindered and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian units and formations,” and said Moscow acknowledges its role in global stability. He asked that his terms for ending the war would need to be cemented in international agreements. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends the G7 summit in Italy, June 13, 2024. Louisa Gouliamaki/Reuters But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country “does not trust” Putin’s “ultimatum,” which he said did not significantly differ from previous offers he has made before. Speaking Friday from the Group of Seven summit in Italy, Zelensky drew parallels between Putin’s tactics and those used by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to conquer swaths of Europe in the 1930s and 40s. “He talks about regions of our country, and he says he will not stop,” Zelensky told CNN affiliate Sky Tg24. “It’s the same thing Hitler did, when he said ‘give me a part of Czechoslovakia and that’s the end of it.’ You can’t trust it,” Zelensky said, referring to Hitler’s annexation of the Sudetenland and Western countries’ failed policy of appeasement. “That is why we must not trust these messages, because Putin follows the same course,” Zelensky warned. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on Kyiv’s allies to “get rid of illusions” and to stop taking Russia’s proposals seriously, describing Putin’s terms as “offensive to common sense.” “There is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It’s all a complete sham,” Podolyak said. Putin’s speech comes on the eve of the Swiss peace conference, in which nearly 100 countries and organizations will take part. He dismissed the conference as “another ploy to divert everyone’s attention.”"

The possibility that former President Donald Trump , who has long been skeptical of providing US military support to NATO and Europe, could win the election “is a huge part” of why NATO is moving forward with the consolidation plan, said one official familiar with the discussions. It is also a way to give Europe more responsibility over the training and equipping of Ukraine as the extent of the US’ commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia after the election remains unclear, the official said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the intent in a news conference on Thursday, saying NATO provides “more than 99% of all military support to Ukraine … so it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts.” “This will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv, and address both immediate and long-term needs,” Stoltenberg said. A US defense official and European diplomat added that the effort will be headquartered in Wiesbaden, Germany and fall under NATO command, led by a three-star general reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Chris Cavoli, who is also the head of US European Command. Earlier in the day on Thursday, Stoltenberg said the “whole idea” of the new framework was to “minimize the risk for gaps and delays” — particularly after a months-long delay by the US in providing additional security aid had real negative impacts on Ukraine’s ability to fight Russia. “The whole idea is to minimize the risk for gaps and delays as we saw earlier this year, because the gaps in delays in both the provision of military support from the United States but also from several European allies, made a difference on the battlefield,” he said. “It is one of the reasons why the Russians are now able to push and to actually occupy more land in Ukraine.” Stoltenberg also said Thursday that he has proposed NATO allies provide Ukraine a minimum of 40 billion euros a year “for as long as it takes” — a number that he said allies have already approximately provided annually since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. Ukraine needs the annual funds “to ensure they have the resources to repel Russian aggression against their country,” he said. CNN previously reported the options around ensuring long-term support for Ukraine, which one senior European diplomat described at the time as “future-proofing.” A senior US Defense Department official told reporters on Thursday it was important to ensure that the capabilities and troops assisting Ukraine is being done with “an eye … towards NATO interoperability and integration.” “Right now it’s pretty ad hoc,” the official said. “A nation raises its hand and says, ‘I’ll do the artillery coalition,’ another says, ‘I’ll do the drone coalition’ — who’s actually sitting down and mapping these things out and making sure that that force that’s being built is going to make sense to deter and defend against what Ukraine needs to deter and defend against? Who’s thinking through the extent to which that force is interoperable with Polish forces, for example. Earlier this week, the plan to centralize the alliance’s military support for Ukraine overcame a major hurdle when Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said that while Hungary will not participate in the scheme, it will not veto it. “The prime minister has assured me that Hungary will not oppose these efforts, enabling other allies to move forward, and he has confirmed that Hungary will continue to meet its NATO commitments in full,” Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group and NATO defense ministers’ meetings are happening in Brussels as a Group of Seven nations summit in Italy is taking place, where support for Ukraine remains a top issue. Leaders of G7 nations have agreed to loan Ukraine money backed by profits from frozen Russian investments. CNN previously reported that the loan amount totals roughly $50 billion, which is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024 — before a potential change in US administrations. The US and Ukraine are also expected to sign a long-term security agreement at the G7 summit, after months of negotiations, but could ultimately be undone by a new administration. Correction: This story has been corrected to properly attribute that the new NATO effort will be overseen by a three-star general and headquartered in Germany."

The plans to hasten tens of billions of dollars to the besieged nation and ink a security agreement between Washington and Kyiv that helps Ukraine achieve self-sufficiency were intended to demonstrate resolve – and a degree of political creativity – amid Russian battlefield momentum. “Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions, and it will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine’s success,” Biden said during a news conference Thursday alongside his counterpart from Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky, who wore his usual army green uniform. Calling Russia’s invasion a “test for the world,” the US leader said he and his allies at the G7 had consistently answered “yes” to the question of whether they would stand by Ukraine. “We will say it again,” he said. “Yes, again and again and again.” Yet whether the measures agreed to this week can withstand another Donald Trump presidency remained something of an unknown. As Biden was finalizing his agreements in Italy, Trump was meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill, where he once again made clear he didn’t want to see another $60 billion in aid flowing to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with his comments. Trump argued, as he had before, that if he were president the war wouldn’t still be going. Opposed to additional Ukraine aid and openly skeptical of NATO, Trump could rip up the bilateral agreement Biden signed Thursday if he returned to office. “If Trump is inaugurated at noon on the 20 of January next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,” said John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump. “So, if you can’t bind a future president who doesn’t want to be bound, and that includes getting out of treaties, which this isn’t even a treaty, I think there may actually be a bit of a downside here when Trump hears about this and concludes they’re trying to lock him in, that will just make him more irritated.” Such a move would be in keeping with Trump’s decisions during his previous term to abandon foreign policy agreements negotiated by his Democratic predecessor, including the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Few European diplomats hold out hope for a change in tactic a second time around. The memories from those years are still fresh for some G7 leaders and have helped drive the urgency in finding ways to funnel support to Ukraine at this year’s summit, before Trump’s prospective return. Speaking at the news conference with Biden, Zelensky said it was up to the American people to demonstrate to their leader – whoever he is – that standing with Ukraine is a priority. “It seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity within this or that state,” he said through a translator. “And if the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom.” Upcoming US election sparks urgency The forthcoming election helped create an impetus to finalize a long-debated plan to give Ukraine a $50 billion loan using interest earned on frozen Russian assets. American and European diplomats had been working through the technicalities of such a proposal for months. European officials were initially reluctant, raising concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal. Yet with uncertainty swirling around any American support in the future, the time to act appeared short. That the differences were resolved during a heated US election, in which one of the candidates openly opposes providing Ukraine any more aid, was not lost on many of the negotiators. “There was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,” a senior US administration official said. “This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world that we’re not going to fatigue on defending Ukraine’s freedom, and that Putin is not going to outlast us.” Officials said Ukraine would receive the first payments from the scheme sometime this year but would need additional time to use up all of the money being sent. “It is a very strong message to make sure that it is not us paying for the Russian damage, but it is Russia who has to pay,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Security deal faces uncertain future in a Trump presidency The deal, in the end, was about more than just money. It was proof, in Biden’s mind, that likeminded allies can overcome differences for the greater good — in this case, helping a besieged democratic nation rebuild its infrastructure after an invasion by Russia. So, too, was his decision to sign a bilateral security accord with Zelensky intended to demonstrate long-term American commitment – even though the agreement has no guarantee of surviving if Trump wins. The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the pact a “real marker” of the American commitment to Ukraine “not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.” And Biden, speaking in Italy, said the pact was designed to make Ukraine more self-sufficient — and, by extension, less dependent on shifting American sentiments. “Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” he said. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.” Still, the pledge is an “executive agreement,” making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. And it does not contain any new money and is instead “subject to the availability of appropriated funds,” according to its text. After a drawn-out battle this year with congressional Republicans to pass $60 billion for Ukraine — causing Biden to apologize last week for delays that US officials say helped Russia regain momentum on the battlefield — there is little likelihood the president will go back to Congress this year for additional funding. Biden pushes G7 to back reproductive rights Even on an issue unrelated to Ukraine, Biden sought this week to consolidate G7 support in a way that would be unlikely if Trump were to return to the summit. Behind the scenes, he and US officials pushed to keep language about reproductive rights in a G7 leaders’ statement after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document, according to American officials. The back-and-forth illustrated some of the fraught dynamics at play at the summit. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid, and a key point of contrast with Trump. “The president felt very strongly that we needed to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women’s health and reproductive rights,” a senior US administration official said, referring to last year’s G7 summit in Japan. In that document, leaders reiterated their support for “access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.” It also expressed “strong concern about the rollback of women’s and girls’ rights.” The trip to the rocky Adriatic coast this week is likely to be Biden’s final time abroad before November’s elections, and a final moment to harden alliances in person and seal agreements before the unknowable outcome of the vote. American allies in Europe are collectively preparing for a second Trump administration with a sense both of trepidation and exhaustion. During diplomatic visits and quiet pull-asides at summits like the G7, it is a topic of constant conversation. French luminaries who were invited to the Élysée Palace last week for a state dinner in honor of Biden openly discussed their anxiety about Trump’s potential return to the White House, according to a person who attended. Those who lived through the experience the first time around have little appetite for a return to the open animosity and norm-busting rituals that came with Trump wherever he went, be it battles over climate on a cliffside in Sicily, haggling on trade in the forests of Quebec or an argument over readmitting Russia at a lighthouse in Biarritz. By the end of his term, Trump had begun questioning the utility of attending the gatherings at all, fed up with what he saw as an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience."

The United States and its G7 contemporaries have placed a high value on showing their support for Ukraine during this year’s summit, which is taking place in Italy. While Ukraine is not a G7 member, its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, attended the summit and participated in a Thursday evening joint news conference with Biden. “Would we stand with Ukraine?” Biden said at the news conference. “Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny? The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered that question by saying yes we will. We will say it again … we’re going to stand with Ukraine.” The leaders will soon issue a joint communiqué, the product of “years” of negotiation complicated by a patchwork of jurisdictional laws that required the direct involvement of Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, among other top US officials. “When you have a commitment at the highest political levels, technocrats act and technical details get worked out,” the official said. “There was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,” the senior official said. The official added that it’s “only fair that we close the gap by making Russia pay, not our taxpayers, and we found a way to do so that respects the rule of law in every jurisdiction.” During the news conference, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine after both leaders signed an agreement vowing lasting US support for Ukraine’s defense now and in the future. But Biden might be making a commitment that he cannot fulfill if his political rival, former President Donald Trump, again wins the White House in November. Further US support for Ukraine could be jeopardized under a new Trump administration. The former president has long spoken admirably of strongmen, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and shocked world leaders by saying earlier this year that he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to US partner countries who don’t fulfill certain defense spending obligations. For his part, Zelensky appeared outwardly optimistic that his country would retain US support no matter who is the president. “They work based on the voice of their people and it is impossible without people,” Zelensky, who was speaking Ukrainian, said of US leaders. “I am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents … and it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity within this or that state — and if the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,” he added, according to a realtime translator. The loan will be drawn from funds frozen by Western leaders in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While just $3 billion in frozen funds is located in US banks, a much larger share, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars, is located in banks in Europe. Negotiators have focused on a loan amount of about $50 billion. It will take some time before Ukraine begins to receive this money, but the official said the effort would “move with urgency” and the commitment remains “to be ready to disburse $50 billion this calendar year.” If the loan is disbursed by the end of 2024 , it would ensure the money got to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November’s presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine. In the United States, which has remained a crucial ally to Ukraine, promises of funding for defense systems and military weaponry are known to be difficult to fulfill. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress held up critically needed military funding for the war-torn country after Trump came out against a deal. That holdup carried with it real-world consequences to Ukraine’s defense capabilities. Though the Senate would eventually pass a $95 billion aid package that included funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Ukrainian officials have said that aid came too late for troops on the ground. The agreement reached in Italy on Thursday would free up chests of funds in Europe that would not be hampered by further political bickering in the United States. “The next steps are to enshrine the communiqué commitments with the EU 27, the full membership, then we need to write contracts between the lenders … the recipient, which is Ukraine, and the intermediaries,” the official said. From there, there will be an agreement on a disbursal schedule. Should a peace agreement be reached and the war end, there is also a plan in place: “G7 leaders have committed that the assets will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damages that’s caused. So if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized and keep generating interest to repay the loans, or Russia pays for the damage it’s caused. Either way, there’s a source of repayment.” This story has been updated with additional reporting."

A 76-page dossier published Thursday by the Starvation Mobile Justice Team of the human rights organization Global Rights Compliance looks in detail at the siege , which it described as “hell on earth” for the port city’s residents, through the lens of the war crime of starvation as a calculated strategy. It found that Russian forces “systematically attacked objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,” while at the same time cutting off evacuation routes and blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid. Ukrainian civilians were cut off from water, electricity and gas and forced to drink from puddles, radiators and melted snow. The findings didn’t come as a surprise to Nikolai Osychenko, who described living through the siege as a “Stone Age” experience. “The Russians bombed the substation that supplied electricity to Mariupol on March 2 and we lost electricity, and at the same time, we also lost the water supply and heating,” he told CNN, adding that the city started running out of food almost immediately, because without electricity, much of it has gone bad. “We all realized that flour is the best thing to have. If you have water and flour, you can cook something. But without water, you can’t do anything,” he said. The Mariupol resident spent two weeks living in one apartment with nine other people, rationing food and scraping together any water they could find. They would spend two days melting buckets of snow with their hand, only to get a few inches of dirty water. Osychenko told CNN that at one point, he drank the water from his radiators, boiling it 20 times over to purify it. Deliberately causing starvation and deprivation constitutes a war crime under international law. The group is in the process of submitting their latest report to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of a larger dossier on Russia’s use of starvation. According to their website, the organization is funded by the governments of the EU Commission, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. CNN has reached out to Russia’s Ministry of Defense for comment. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, was encircled and captured by Russian forces at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Local officials estimate that as many as 22,000 people were killed in the battle for the city, which is located in Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast and has been under direct Russian control since May 2022. ‘Hell on earth’ It was in Mariupol that Russian forces carried out some of their most notorious strikes, including an attack on a maternity hospital and the bombing of a theater in which up to 1,300 civilians had sought refuge, according to local officials. The report, entitled, “’The Hope Left Us:’ Russia’s Siege, Starvation, and Capture of Mariupol City’” explores how “peaceful” Mariupol was turned into “hell on earth” in February 2022. It uses open-source research to analyse over 1.5 billion square meters of satellite imagery, as well as photographs, videos, official public statements, and other digital data collected between May 2022 and February 2024. Its several hundred thousand residents were forced to find alternative coping strategies during Russia’s siege, amid dwindling supplies and the obstruction of humanitarian aid. This included the establishment of ad hoc distribution points for food, water and other basic necessities. Women walk past a destroyed apartment building in Mariupol in May 2022. Alexei Alexandrov/AP These distribution points, however, including the Mariupol Drama Theater and Neptun Swimming Pool Complex, became targets for the Russian army. “Sustained attacks against Mariupol City forced the distribution of essential items to become largely mobile in order to mitigate risks of shelling, though a significant number of both mobile and stationary distribution points were still shelled, repeatedly exposing vulnerable and hungry residents to significant risk to their lives and means of securing basic necessities,” the report found. It also found several instances where the delivery of vital humanitarian aid was allegedly denied or deliberately obstructed by Russian forces, while civilians were unable to evacuate from the city. “Despite Russian forces’ command failing to halt hostilities in order to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, aid delivery was also directly blocked by pro-Russian forces operating at checkpoints erected around evacuation corridors between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia.” 85-day offensive Osychenko said he and his family survived the ordeal thanks to his wife’s and niece’s careful planning. “They were in charge of food and they divided the food very clearly: so much porridge, so much this and so much that for the day. Once I caught them not eating at all. They cooked for us but they didn’t eat because they knew that there was nowhere to get food, and there was less and less of it,” he said. Yousuf Syed Khan, a senior lawyer with law firm Global Rights Compliance, told CNN he believes there was no doubt that the siege of Mariupol amounted to a war crime. “They [the Russian army] did not allow for international organizations to provide civilian evacuations… even though the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as well as the United Nations attempted numerous times to evacuate civilians. “Number two is that they did not allow the entry of humanitarian aid. So not once through the 85-day offensive was there any pause in which they allowed humanitarian aid to enter Mariupol.” Khan continued: “On top of that, they were attacking indispensable objects. They were attacking electricity, they were attacking water. They were attacking food distribution points.” There were numerous opportunities for Russian forces to alleviate civilian suffering, he said, but they failed to do so. Osychenko said that with each day, the situation was getting more and more desperate. Mothers that had small children, many of them  lost milk from the stress and hunger, there was no formula, no children food,” he said. The destroyed Mariupol theater building pictured in April 2022. Pavel Klimov/Reuters When Russian troops took over the city, they tried to take advantage of the desperate situation. “When Russia came to the city, when they started delivering food to people in basements, giving candies to children, even if you hate Russia, you will go out to them and take it. Because you have nothing to eat, your kids have nothing to drink. It’s brutal,” he said. Khan said the way Moscow approached the siege was part of a broader strategy that Russian and pro-Russian forces have used regularly in the past eight years. He pointed to sieges laid by pro-Russian forces across Syria, including those in eastern Aleppo City and Ghouta, as examples of heavy-handed Russian tactics. Ukrainian authorities and some international officials have previously accused Russia of robbing the country of grain and other commodities in areas it occupied. Accusations that Russia is using food as a weapon of war have been mounting ever since the first reports emerged in the spring of 2022 of grain being stolen by Russian troops. The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Ukraine. It has so far issued four arrest warrants related to Ukraine, including for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the alleged deportation of Ukrainian children."

Pashinyan has for months accused the Kremlin’s Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) of failing to protect Armenia from resurgent Azerbaijani aggression, threatening to leave the bloc if Moscow did not provide greater assurances and trying to cleave more closely to the United States and European Union. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Azerbaijan reclaimed in full by force in September. Russia has traditionally allied with Armenia, but their relations have soured in recent months while Moscow’s ties to Azerbaijan have deepened. Speaking to parliamentarians in the capital Yerevan, Pashinyan said his country had “frozen” its participation in the CSTO and would leave the bloc at a time of Armenia’s choosing. “We will decide when we leave, but we will not go back,” Pashinyan was quoted in state media Armenpress as saying. “It turned out that members of the alliance are not fulfilling their contractual obligations, but are planning a war with Azerbaijan against us.” Pashinyan stopped short of naming the accused countries in the bloc, which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and was founded in 1992 as the Soviet Union crumbled. Pashinyan confirmed to lawmakers that Armenia will withdraw from the Russia-led military alliance. Karen Minasyan/AFP/Getty Images The rupture in Armenia’s relations with Russia comes after Azerbaijan retook Nagorno-Karabakh in a one-day war in September, sparking an exodus of virtually all of the Caucasian enclave’s ethnic Armenian population, despite the presence there of Russian peacekeepers. Several Karabakh Armenians told CNN at the time that they felt “betrayed” by Russian peacekeepers who “did nothing” to protect them, leaving them no choice but to abandon their homes and flee to Armenia proper. As more than 100,000 people took to the only road out of Karabakh, a billboard displaying the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin watched down over them. Some 2,000 Russian peacekeepers had deployed to Karabakh after a 44-day war in 2020, when Azerbaijan retook about a third of the enclave, in an offensive halted only by a Moscow-brokered ceasefire – which Azerbaijan would eventually breach three years later. 11/22/2023 Yerevan, Armenia.

On September 19th Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive against the Armenian Republic of Artsakh. The violation was seen as a breach in the 2020 ceasefire, which led to over 190 servicemen killed, and over 360 wounded. After the fighting officially ended on September 21, Azerbaijan opened the border for the first time in months to allow people to leave, this was followed by the opening of the Lachin corridor on September 24th (which had been blocked for over 9 months leading scarcities in food, medicine and other goods), the mass migration of over 100,000 ethnic Armenians fleeing their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh in fear of persecution and ethnic cleansing.

Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev had described retaking Karabakh as the “sacred goal” of his presidency. Despite international condemnation of the exodus of Karabakh Armenians, which officials in Yerevan said amounted to ethnic cleansing , there was hope that this was the tragic price of putting an end to one of the world’s most protracted conflicts. But a formal peace treaty has not been signed despite months of negotiations. In April, however, Armenia agreed to return four border villages to Azerbaijan, which both countries described as a major step toward a peace deal. Buoyed by recent progress, Pashinyan said Wednesday that Armenia is “ready to sign a peace agreement within a month,” describing the terms of the deal as “fully developed and ready to be finalized.” Russian peacekeepers, pictured here in Nagorno-Karabakh in October 2023, withdrew from the enclave on Wednesday. AFP/Getty Images But attempting to normalizing ties with Azerbaijan has stoked discontent at home, as protesters have accused Pashinyan of making unacceptable land concessions to Aliyev. Azerbaijan has also demanded that Armenia change its constitution to remove a reference to Karabakh independence, but Pashinyan has so far resisted the calls. In scenes reminiscent of those that propelled Pashinyan to power in 2018, protests erupted outside the parliament in Yerevan on Wednesday. Videos showed police using stun grenades to repel the crowds. More than 100 police officers and civilians were injured, Armenpress reported. The protests have been spearheaded by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, who has for months called for Pashinyan’s resignation. “The problem is very simple: this man must leave, there is no other option,” Galstanyan wrote Wednesday on social media. While Pashinyan has not yet specified when Armenia will leave the CSTO, the last of the Russian peacekeepers who had been deployed to Karabakh completed their withdrawal on Wednesday, Azerbaijan’s defense ministry said."

A new law means commanders can now turn to prisons in search of convicts to recruit as soldiers.,"Jun 13, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Unknown,Ukraine,"Central Ukraine CNN — Battalion commander Dmytro Kukharchuk speaks quietly but firmly. Holding his tattooed hands behind his back, he tells the men – all convicts – about his experience fighting for Ukraine in Bakhmut and Avdiivka . Kukharchuk, 34, is at a prison in central Ukraine, trying to recruit physically strong, healthy and motivated prisoners into his unit, the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. More than two years on from Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine is struggling to replenish its depleted military ranks. To address this, the government introduced a new law last month permitting the recruitment of convicts. It allows individuals who meet certain conditions to be granted conditional early release if they sign a contract to serve in the military. Kukharchuk doesn’t promise the prisoners much. “It won’t be easy. But when you come to us, you come to a family,” he tells the men, explaining that the brigade will not have any special “penal” units. Instead, he says, the recruited prisoners will be integrated into the existing battalions. Some of the men listen attentively, others smirk. But even those who smirk start paying attention when Kukharchuk’s colleague starts speaking. The man, who asked CNN to identify him only by his call sign “Dato” because of privacy concerns, is one of them. He has spent much of his life behind bars. Convicted of various crimes, he escaped from prison three times and was paroled in February 2022 after serving 31 years. He joined the Ukrainian army just hours after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Members of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade seek to recruit convicts in a prison in central Ukraine. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN Dato, 58, commands respect from his audience. His voice cuts through the yard and when he pauses, the silence is heavy. Dozens of prisoners hang on his every word. Some are standing outside in the yard; others are leaning out of the windows of their cells.  His speech is peppered with prison slang. He speaks of honor, duty, and reputation. “This is your chance to rehabilitate yourself in the eyes of your children,” he tells them. Recruiters from several brigades have already visited this prison of 700 men, and about 100 inmates have already signed contracts with different units. The new law does not allow the recruitment of people convicted of crimes against the foundations of national security of Ukraine, or of particularly serious corruption offenses. Those who committed the most violent offenses are also excluded. People convicted of two or more premeditated murders, of crimes committed with cruelty, or of murders combined with rape or sexual violence, are barred from signing up. According to the Ministry of Justice, 5,000 inmates have applied to join the military since the law was signed. Some are already undergoing basic training at a training ground in central Ukraine. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN How exactly the law will work in practice remains to be seen. After it was passed, Ukraine’s Justice Ministry said the inmates, who must sign up of their own free will, would serve in separate units. But Kukharchuk and Dato, representing the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, would like to have the prison recruits serve with regular infantry. Kukharchuk told CNN the soldiers from his brigade have no issues with fighting alongside convicts. “How can you have a special attitude towards people who come to you, who will sit in the same trench with you, who will participate in assault operations with you and have your back?” he said.

And they need very good people to lead them,” one commander, who goes by the call sign “Teren” and is fighting in Avdiivka, told CNN. The artillery reconnaissance commander with the 110th Mechanized Brigade asked for his real name not to be used for security reasons. “I am not against prisoners fighting at all. I’m surprised that we didn’t use this idea at the beginning of the war. There are always a lot of casualties among the infantry, and if the convicts want to (risk their lives) to go to fight in the infantry, it’s a good decision,” he added. The push to recruit inmates into the military appears at first glance to parallel a campaign of prison recruitment by Russia’s mercenary company Wagner early in the war, and continued by the Ministry of Defense since last year. The lives of thousands of Russian convicts have been expended in so-called “meat grinder” assaults , particularly in the fighting for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. But Ukraine’s Minister of Justice Denys Maliuska, speaking to CNN in Kyiv, rejected the comparison. “In Ukraine, motivation is largely based on patriotism. Our prisoners join the army voluntarily. In Russia, it was voluntary and forced. I personally saw (Russian) prisoners who were forced to join Wagner,” he said, adding that in Russia, inmates were recruited into the notoriously brutal private military company, whereas in Ukraine, they are joining the Armed Forces of Ukraine. “This is a regular state military service with all the guarantees: salary, social insurance, payments in case of injury, death, and so on. This is a completely different story in terms of motives and mechanisms.” Shaking off the ‘ex-prisoner’ label The convict recruits will be allowed the same family leave as other soldiers and will be entitled to the same salary but won’t receive the annual leave that is standard for other troops, according to the law. According to the Ministry of Justice, 26,000 people are currently in prison in Ukraine. Since the law came into effect, 5,000 male inmates have applied to join the military, the ministry says. Nearly 2,000 have already passed their medical examination and been released from prison into the military by the courts. The first tranche of prisoner recruits is already in basic training, according to Maliuska.

Men are often the victims The minister said he expected more convicts to sign up. Many are waiting to see what happens to the first round of recruits, he said, but the initial reaction has been positive. Maliuska believes many prisoners see the program as a chance to shake off the “ex-prisoner” label that tends to stick to people even after their release. “There are definitely risks. But the morale and mood of those who are released from prison are much higher than that of those who were mobilized somewhere on the street,” he told CNN. “A person forcibly mobilized who did not want to go to the army sees it as a tragedy, and a deterioration in his living conditions. And you can expect desertion from this category (of soldiers) much more than from a person for whom it is a rise in the social ladder, income, lifestyle, and respect. For prisoners, it is a rise in the social ladder.” The minister told CNN the government knows that prisoners might present challenges to commanders on the ground, but he said the law can be tweaked as needed depending on how things look in practice. A lot will depend on unit commanders and their ability to establish discipline in the prisoner units, he said. Dmytro, 28, a convict recruit whose wife and two kids were killed by a Russian strike in the eastern city of Izium in April 2022, joined the army as soon as he was given the opportunity. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN ‘I will now protect other families’ At a training ground in central Ukraine, a group of prisoners is already into the second week of basic training. Among them is 28-year-old Dmytro, whose wife and two young children were killed by a Russian strike in the eastern city of Izium just weeks into the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while he was serving a four-and-a-half-year term in prison. He asked CNN not to publish his last name for security reasons. Dmytro told CNN he knew he wanted to fight from the moment the war started. When the recruiters visited his prison, he was among the first to sign up.

But since I couldn’t, I will now protect other families who want to live and have children,” he told CNN. Dmytro told CNN that he grew up as an orphan and started stealing when he was young. He said that he believes prison teaches people how to survive in a tough environment, which means that former prisoners might be able to handle the pressures of the front lines better than ordinary civilians. He told CNN that when his family was killed, he wanted revenge. He cannot bear to talk about those he lost now, but dreams of the day he might be able to start afresh and have children who would be proud of him. “I have a year and five months left of my sentence. That is not much. I could stay in prison and not go to war. But I am motivated. I don’t want other people to go through this,” he said, referring to the loss of his family. Back at the prison, Kukharchuk and Dato select their recruits carefully. Sitting across from them in an interview room, they ask each of the volunteers about their background and their motivation. The brigade does not accept those who are over 50 years old, have any serious health problems or are physically unfit. Orphans, on the other hand, are immediately favored. Kukharchuk told CNN that orphans who have had a difficult childhood and are used to surviving and coping with difficulties tend to do well in the military. After each interview, the prisoners shake hands with the recruiters. Those selected fill out paperwork then await further instructions. Of the 17 inmates who wanted to join on the day CNN visited the prison, the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade recruited 12. Kukharchuk said that was “a very good number”.  The brigade is one of the most highly sought-after units and it usually rejects more than half of the convicts wanting to join it. There are exceptions to the rules. One of the prisoners has poor eyesight and Dato and Kukharchuk at first hesitate to recruit him. After a short chat though, the man is accepted. “Eyesight can be corrected. Motivation is more important than eyesight,” says Dato."

Negotiators had focused discussions on a loan amount of roughly $50 billion, a figure that would represent the annual proceeds on the investments – which generate profit of about EUR 3 billion per year – over the course of 10 years. The loan is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024, which would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. President Joe Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine. Western nations froze Russia’s assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount – roughly $3 billion – located in banks in the US. That led European officials to raise concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit, or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal. A senior US official says negotiators, who have continued working out final details in Brindisi, Italy, ahead of the G7 leaders’ arrival, have structured the deal so that all countries participating share the risk. “This loan will mostly be provided by the United States and will be supplemented by money from Europe,” an Élysée source told journalists at a briefing. “Countries are still discussing how to partition the cost if the profits from Russian assets are not sufficient to cover the need,” the French source added. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing professional norms in Europe. “The $50 billion will be transferred before the end of 2024,” the source said. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden to the summit that the discussions were moving toward a “common understanding” of how the loan would be structured, though multiple countries would participate and work out the technical details after the summit. “I believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use,” Sullivan said. G7 countries began brainstorming ways to identify longer-term sources of funding for Ukraine in late 2023, as lawmakers delayed in greenlighting the White House’s funding request. Amid doubts on future political and financial wherewithal to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine – and facing a calendar stacked with elections on both sides of the Atlantic – officials began zeroing in on the Russian money gathering dust and interest payments in accounts around the world. Beginning in early 2023, working groups led by Treasury, State and the National Security Council officials held three, two-hour meetings each week beginning at 7 a.m. ET to accommodate time differences around the world. Banks and clearing houses that hold and process the funds raised concerns that simply taking the money would open up companies and countries alike to lawsuits and retribution from Russia. Utilizing the profits generated while Russia has no access to the money was conceived as a workaround that satisfied international legal concerns. “It’s the difference between someone seizing your home and renting out your home,” said Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance. The United States has provided $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, a total that now surpasses the $171 billion in 2024 dollars that the US provided to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. The European Union has delivered $107 billion in aid. The World Bank estimates that Ukraine would need more than $500 billion to rebuild, a figure that climbs each day the war continues.

In the harrowing years that have followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the besieged nation’s soccer team has become a beacon of hope for a country still suffering under the weight of war. It’s a responsibility that the team takes very seriously and one which it will use as motivation at this year’s European Championship – the first major tournament Ukraine has qualified for since the war began in 2022.

After war broke out, his life changed forever “We all understand that football is not the most important thing now in Ukraine,” Ukraine head coach Sergiy Rebrov tells CNN Sport . “But I think our successful performance in Europe gives our people in Ukraine positive emotions. “Before [the war], when you’re fighting on the pitch, you are thinking only about the result. But I think all of us now are thinking about the result and about showing Europe the real character of our country.” Ukraine finished third in its Euro 2024 qualifying group, behind England and Italy, but beat Bosnia-Herzegovina and then Iceland in a tense playoff campaign to qualify for the major tournament. After securing its place in the competition back in March, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the team for “proving once again that when it is difficult for Ukrainians, but they do not give up and continue to fight.” Rebrov also said the team received happy messages from soldiers on the frontline, who said how proud they were of the achievement. Ukraine will now have the chance to provide another morale boost for the nation as it tests itself against Europe’s elite, first facing Romania on Monday before playing Belgium and Slovakia in its remaining Group E games. The team hopes to provide Ukraine with some respite from the war during the tournament. Rafal Oleksiewicz/Getty Images Rebrov, who became a popular figure in Ukrainian soccer as a player, took over as head coach of the national team in 2023 and has overseen the development of an exciting group of players, led by the likes of Chelsea star Mykhailo Mudryk and Arsenal’s Oleksandr Zinchenko. But Rebrov says managing the team during wartime has been challenging. CNN/Getty Images Related article ‘I was scared about my family:’ Why two Ukrainian footballers keep playing despite Russia’s invasion Many of the stadiums in Ukraine – some of which helped co-host the European Championship 12 years ago – have been damaged by the fighting. That, combined with the constant threat of Russian violence, means Ukraine can’t play or train in its home country, forced instead to travel around the continent to play its home games. “Traveling to the games is very hard. But, as I said, compared with our fighters, it’s nothing,” adds Rebrov, reflecting a sentiment at the heart of everything the team says and does. Communication, then, is key to helping players and backroom staff who have been impacted directly by the consequences of war. Rebrov says having those conversations is often “very hard” but that he tries to remind his players what they are fighting for every time they pull on that yellow and blue jersey. To do this, the manager says he sometimes relays messages from those fighting on the frontline during team talks and has even shown his players videos of children who have had their lives impacted by the fighting before games. “They made some videos for several minutes and, of course, the players were crying,” he says. “When you’re watching this video, of course, you come onto the pitch with a different sort of motivation.” Ukraine's head coach Sergiy Rebrov says players are all motivated to help their country. Focke Strangmann/AFP/Getty Images Heading into the European Championship, Ukraine has already achieved a major goal by just being there. It’s a powerful symbol that, despite everything, a Ukrainian team is still representing the war-torn country on the global stage. Russia, meanwhile, will not take part given UEFA’s continued ban on its participation. While Rebrov knows that qualification alone has brought some good news to Ukrainians around the world, he still wants his team to do itself proud at the tournament in Germany and has told his players to give their “maximum.” “We are there and we deserve to be there. I think now is very important to prepare seriously and to show again the spirit of our nation,” he says, while not setting any specific goals for progression at the Euros. “Football is different for our players. They are concentrated, but the target is different: not only winning the match. “I think it’s very important during the game to show passion, to show character, like shown by our defenders.” Ukraine will play its first match at Euro 2024 against Romania on Monday. Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty Images Earlier in June, Ukraine documented its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost one year, amid Russia’s sweeping offensive on the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a “significant increase” – at least 31% – in the number of civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April, according to a press release. Set to that backdrop, Rebrov knows that sport is not very important, but he’s aware it still has a huge role to play in the war effort. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has called on the nation’s biggest sports stars to fly Ukraine’s flag and the likes of heavyweight boxer Oleksandr Usyk and tennis star Elina Svitolina have continued to draw attention to their country’s needs. This year’s European Championship is yet another opportunity for Ukraine’s soccer team  to do their bit in boosting morale. “Everybody from Ukraine […] is trying to help each other, trying to help our defenders, trying to help the volunteers,” Rebrov says. “Of course, the most important dream is to finish this war and continue to rebuild our country.”"

Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago. “We will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,” Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. “Ukraine’s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. … The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.” Yet Biden’s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president’s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe’s security. And the “autocrats of the world” name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House. Video Ad Feedback Biden gives warning about democracy during D-Day 80th anniversary speech 01:31 - Source: CNN Biden’s emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy . But uncertainty over the West’s long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It’s fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky. In the United States, Trump – who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe’s security given his endless attacks on NATO – may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend – especially in powerhouses France and Germany – could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin’s willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does. But a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine’s Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America’s fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November. A flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine Still, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent. —Biden’s return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House’s priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries. —As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin’s war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. “Russia today has become a war economy,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. “Every day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.” —Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine’s armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. “We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we’ll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the “executive agreement” would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power. —US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit – which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada – will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets. —These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky’s elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance. Russian advances on the battlefield These are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured. The latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites “a worrisome trend” of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Relentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv’s electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon. Russian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe’s territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war. “The Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,” Clark said. “Don’t underestimate them. Technically, they’re pretty smart. They’ve got China behind them; they’ve got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.” Ukraine’s heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later. An inspiring war turns into a bitter slog An extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine – which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes. At times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky’s interactions with the West. The Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package – a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up. Biden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan. Not surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden’s core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president’s critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to “take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine’s fight for freedom.” But there’s a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power."

The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. But the pledge is expected to be an “executive agreement,” the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he’d “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” if Europe didn’t increase its defense funding. The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine’s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said. An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine’s defense. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday that the US’ commitment to Ukraine “will continue to be right up front and clear” at the G7, and that the US “will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine fight for freedom.” President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet during the summit , Kirby said, and the US will announce steps to unlock Russia’s frozen assets for use in Ukraine’s reconstruction after the war ends. The pledge the US and Ukraine are expected to sign will be similar to the 14 other bilateral agreements Ukraine has already reached with other allies, including the UK, France and Germany. The US-Ukraine agreement will be the 15 th such deal signed, one of the sources said, and 17 other countries have committed to negotiating similar bilateral security pacts with Ukraine. As part of the deal, the US will promise to hold consultations with Ukraine immediately following a future attack by Russia to determine next steps, said the people familiar with the agreement’s contours. The UK, France and Germany also included provisions calling for such talks within 24 hours of a Russian attack. But the bilateral agreement with the US, like with Ukraine’s other allies, will not include a mutual defense clause, which would commit them to defending Ukraine militarily in the event of another attack. While Zelensky has welcomed the bilateral commitments, he has said repeatedly that they are not a substitute for full NATO membership, which does have a mutual defense provision known as Article V. The agreement comes as the US-Ukrainian relationship has begun to recover after faltering late last year and into this year amid a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine – something Biden personally apologized to Zelensky for during a meeting in Paris last week. Biden also recently agreed to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike into Russia directly , a major shift that Ukraine had been asking for months as Russia pummeled Kharkiv with missiles from just across the border."

The ban, called the “Leahy Law,” prohibits any military assistance or training to be provided to foreign units held responsible for human rights violations, according to the US State Department. The battalion, named the 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade, was integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard in 2023, after the initial formation dissolved. The unit has been praised for its role in the fight against Russian occupation in the Mariupol area. The unit welcomed the lifting of the ban on receiving security assistance from the US, saying in a statement Tuesday, “This is a new page in the history of our unit.” “Eligibility for US assistance will not only increase Azov’s combat effectiveness, but, most importantly, will help save the lives and health of the brigade’s personnel,” the unit said. “Azov is becoming more professional and more effective in defending Ukraine against the invaders.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the US decision on Tuesday, saying the US is “ready even to flirt with neo-Nazis,” according to Russian state news agency TASS. Major battles Founded as a militia to defend Ukraine against Russia’s invasion in 2014, the unit was initially called the “Azov Battalion,” active around the Mariupol area. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense encouraged at the time volunteer battalions to help the army and resistance efforts. Later that year, the Azov battalion was “reorganized and expanded into the Azov Special Police Regiment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,” before becoming part of the National Guard, according to its website. In 2015, Azov fighters liberated Mariupol and its surroundings from occupation, pushing Russian forces far away from the city. They took part in several major battles in Donetsk region. The battalion has said it repeatedly denies “allegations of fascism, nazism and racism,” in response to claims it had associations with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology. The US State Department said Tuesday that Russian disinformation “has actively worked to discredit” the unit. “They have long tried to conflate Ukraine’s National Guard Unit of 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov with a militia formed to defend Ukraine against Russia’s invasion in 2014, called the “Azov Battalion,” a State Department spokesperson said. “That militia disbanded in 2015 and the Special Forces Brigade Azov is unrelated to that militia.” After applying the Leahy vetting process, the State Department “found no evidence of Gross Violations of Human Rights” committed by the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. Russian Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday the steps taken by Washington “can cause nothing but extreme indignation.” He called the brigade “an openly nationalist formation” and said Moscow is concerned over “US approaches in the fight against terrorism.” After the bombing of a Mariupol theater in 2022 that was sheltering civilians and had the word “children” written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused “militants of the nationalist ‘Azov’ battalion” of carrying out the attack. At the time, local Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attack, which is believed to have killed hundreds who were sheltering in the theater amid heavy bombardment in the early days of Russia’s invasion. The city of Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, after Ukrainian soldiers, including members of the Azov unit, and residents sheltered for weeks underground at the city’s massive Azovstal steelworks plant refusing to surrender to Russian forces.

Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup . Greece at Euro 2004 . Just some of the shocks that have shaken the game to the core, written unheralded names into soccer folklore and generated stories that have been, and will continue to be, spoken about for generations to come. Could Poland produce an equally seismic surprise at Euro 2024? Even the most optimistic Poland fan, and for that matter soccer fan, would think this to be a pipe dream far beyond one’s wildest imagination. Poland captain Robert Lewandowski, though, thinks otherwise. “In football, you never know. You have to believe and we have the hope,” the country’s iconic forward told CNN’s Sport’s Amanda Davies at the recent inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy. “If we’re playing as a team … really, we can achieve something. I don’t know, what does it mean in the end but in football everything is possible.” Seizing the moment Lewandowski is challenged by Valeriy Bondar during the international friendly match between Poland and Ukraine at Stadion Narodowy on June 07, 2024 in Warsaw, Poland. Adam Nurkiewicz/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images For Poland, just to be at this summer’s tournament can, to some extent, already be classified as an achievement. Lewandowski’s side endured one of its worst qualifying campaigns in recent memory. Dispensing with head coach Fernando Santos and bringing in Michał Probierz – Poland’s fifth coach in three years – at the midway point following humiliating losses to Moldova and Albania, winning just three of eight qualifying games and ultimately failing to progress directly from a group in which it finished third.

Alex Caparros/Getty Images Poland was the last team to book its ticket to the finals after edging past Wales on penalties in the playoffs. Expectations, therefore, for Germany are low. And yet the ‘free hit’ mentality may well be just what the country needs to spring a surprise. With the backing of a large, vocal contingent of supporters who’ll make the journey across the border, the prolific No. 9 said his team must be primed to seize its opportunity. “Always in the big tournaments some kind of teams can get troubles and you have to be ready to use the time you have [and] the opportunity to win the game and to get the points,” he explained. “We are playing in Germany, the country is very close to Poland. So probably a lot of fans from Poland are coming to this tournament so we are very happy, and we try to enjoy every day to be there.” WROCLAW, POLAND - SEPTEMBER 09: Gareth Southgate, Head Coach of England, looks on prior to the UEFA EURO 2024 European qualifier match between Ukraine and England at Stadion Wroclaw on September 09, 2023 in Wroclaw, Poland.

Poland has been drawn into arguably one of the toughest groups of the tournament, alongside two-time European champion France, the Netherlands and Austria – all ranked above them. Arguably, Poland’s most realistic chance of making it through to the knockout rounds may well lie in trying to qualify as one of the best ranked third-placed teams. To add to the difficulty, Lewandowski will miss Poland’s opening game of the tournament against the Netherlands on June 16 after suffering a muscle tear in his thigh picked up in the recent friendly win against Turkey. The country’s FA say it will be doing everything possible to get him fit for the team’s second game against Austria on June 21. But defying the odds is something the country has previous experience of in this tournament having reached the quarterfinals in 2016. Only a penalty shootout defeat to eventual champion Portugal put pay to that Cinderella story.

Andrej Isakovic/AFP/Getty Images Lewandowski, though, is under no illusions of the task that awaits but said playing on the underdog status and leaning on past experiences could go a long way to determining Poland’s fate in the competition. “Even though we have a very tough group, we are ready,” said the upbeat forward. “I think we are playing good football [and] we know that we are not the favourites in the group stage. “But this is football – Sometimes one day, one game, 90 minutes… With the luck you can win something […] I am very positive in this month.” Familiar territory The tournament will also have added significance for the 35-year-old. It was in Germany where Lewandowski rose to global prominence, spending 12 years playing for two of the powerhouse clubs in the country: Borussia Dortmund and then  Bayern Munich. Robert Lewandowski played in Germany for 12 years. Boris Streubel/Getty Images At Dortmund, he collected Bundesliga titles. At Bayern, he was integral to its 2020 Champions League victory which formed part of a historic treble for the club. Named Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times, he left Germany in 2022 as the league’s second highest goalscorer of all time, only behind Gerd Müller’s record of 365 goals. He’ll return to Berlin – the scene of many a German domestic cup triumph – in Poland’s second group game against Austria and then Dortmund for the team’s group finale against Kylian Mbappé’s France. “I know the people, I know the culture, I know almost everything, so I think that I am going to feel really, really well,” he said, smiling. “And very exciting as well to be playing again in these big stadiums, not only in Dortmund that I spent four years, but also [in] Berlin. “The atmosphere [in Berlin] I can say [is] similar [to] the Champions League final because the stadium and everything around is really beautiful.” Could Germany also serve as the perfect swansong for his international career? This will be the sixth major tournament for Poland’s all-time top scorer, but he insisted that retirement wasn’t on his mind. “[On retirement] I cannot say yes or no. It depends on many different things, many different options,” he explained. “Physically, I’m feeling very well. I don’t see the difference, especially in this year than before. “If I feel something inside in my head, saying to me ‘Okay, maybe it’s time to say goodbye’ then I know that the time is coming. But until now, I didn’t feel this kind of feeling so it’s still not this kind of way that I’m thinking about this.” Ukrainian Pride While Poland will be at the forefront of Lewandowski’s mind, he’ll also be keeping a close eye on Ukraine’s progress at the tournament. The Pole has been a staunch ally of the embattled country and a long-time advocate for refugees since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022.

Despite narrowly missing out on a place in Qatar, Sergiy Rebrov’s side sealed its place at the Euros with a dramatic come-from-behind victory against Iceland in a playoff final in March. Poland currently acts as home to nearly one million Ukrainians who have fled since February 2022, according to UN data. Ukraine begins its group stage campaign against Romania on June 17, before facing Slovakia and then Belgium. Lewandowski was confident that the team’s appearance in Germany could give the country reason to be optimistic. “They were fighting [a] similar situation before the World Cup and they were so close and now they did it,” he said. “In the difficult situation, if you’ve got some kind of positive things like football that everyone around the world [is] speaking, thinking about the football, and if they see now this team on this kind of tournament, they can be proud. “Probably, for sure, the people of Ukraine now cannot wait [for] the first game.”"

The Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, nicknamed the “Felon” by NATO, was struck on the tarmac of an airbase in the Astrakhan region, almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines of fighting in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency (GUR). The agency posted satellite pictures in a post on its Telegram channel to support its claim, writing, “The images show that on June 7, Su-57 was still intact, but on June 8, craters from the explosion and distinctive fire spots emerged near it as a result of the fire damage.” The Su-57 is a supersonic, twin-engine, fifth-generation stealth fighter jet and was seen as Moscow’s answer to Western stealth jets like the US Air Force’s F-22 Raptor. But its development, which began in 2002, according to the US military, has been slow, and an Su-57 crashed during a 2019 test flight. Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jets take part in a flight demonstration in Zhukovskiy, Russia on August 27, 2019. Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images The Russian military received its first Su-57 in 2020, according to a report by the state-run TASS news agency, which said the jet was earlier “tested” in combat conditions in Syria in 2018. The Ukrainian Telegram post noted the Su-57’s ability to carry Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles, which the jet could launch against Ukraine from the safety of Russian airspace. While experts have expressed doubts on the Su-57’s capabilities compared to the F-22, Russian officials have praised its role in attacks on Ukraine . In a 2022 TASS report, then Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the Su-57 “has shown itself brilliantly.” “The aircraft has a very high degree of protection against various air defense systems, has protection against missiles … Most importantly, it has very powerful weapons. We also tried and tested these weapons, they work brilliantly,” Shoigu said at the time. Ukrainian forces said they successfully destroyed one of Russia's most advanced combat jets, SU-57, in a drone strike on a military base deep inside Russia. GUR The exact number of combat-ready Su-57s available to Russia’s air force is unclear. Flight Global’s “World Air Forces 2024” directory lists 14 Su-57s as active and another 62 as on order. “The Russian Aerospace Forces currently have only a limited number of these combat aircraft in service,” the GUR Telegram post said. TASS reported in 2022 that Russian forces will receive a total of 22 Su-57s by the end of this year. If the reports of the Ukrainian drone strike deep inside Russia prove true, it marks another success of Kyiv’s low-cost drones taking out high-value Russian assets. The price of an Su-57 is estimated to be $35 million to $54 million, according to the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Ukraine Russian patrol ship Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Related article Ukraine’s drones sink another Russian warship, Kyiv says Drone strikes have become an increasing problem for Moscow. Other Ukrainian drones have been used to sink or severely damage Russian warships in the Black Sea, and tanks and armored vehicles have fallen prey to drones on the battlefield. The attack would also bring new worries for Russia in protecting bases far back from the battlefield. “This is a really a trend that the Russians are worried about,” said CNN contributor Jill Dougherty, the network’s former Moscow bureau chief. “The Ukrainians are attacking more and more inside Russia and taking the battle to them,” Dougherty said. After reports of the strike surfaced, Russian military bloggers criticized the military for not building hangars to protect the Su-57s, noting that protective hangars could be constructed at every air base for the price of one Su-57, according to the Institute for the Study of War."

The Biden administration has been leading a campaign to persuade leaders of the fellow G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan – to sign off on a plan that it views as vital to giving Ukraine a shot at turning around its prospects on the battlefield as it continues to fend off the Russian assault. The ultimate goal, sources said, is to iron out some of the thorniest financing details in the coming days so that an agreement can be announced as part of the G7 leaders’ communiqué this week. But questions about the modalities of such a program – including the precise form of disbursement and repayment assurances, among others – are still in the process of being worked out. US officials argue that the dire situation for Ukraine makes the approval of such a loan deeply urgent. Even if the details behind what officials hope could amount to up to a $50 billion loan package have not yet been finalized, the G7 nations are in agreement on the urgency of the moment – and Ukraine’s desperate need for a lifeline . The world’s richest economies coming together behind such a plan would send a stark message to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, US officials say, that Russia will not outlast the US and its allies’ continued support for Ukraine. “This is a priority for the United States. We believe it’s a priority for the entire G7,” Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week. “We want to see every country come on board with a method by which we can mobilize resources for Ukraine at scale so that they are able to have what they need to be able to succeed in this war.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be present at the G7 gathering to once again press for more assistance on the global stage. Biden’s upcoming trip to Italy will come on the heels of his multi-day visit to France , where the US’ support for Ukraine’s war efforts emerged as a major theme. Biden met with Zelensky as his administration announced a $225 million security assistance package for Ukraine. As he vowed that the US is “not going to walk away from you,” Biden publicly apologized this week to Zelensky for Congress’ months-long delay in approving additional American assistance for Ukraine. The delay, US officials have said in recent months, undoubtedly resulted in Ukraine losing valuable ground on the battlefield. “I apologize for the weeks of not knowing what’s going to pass, in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up, but we got it done,” Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart."

But its forces are being stretched elsewhere ...","Jun 9, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Svitlana Vlasova,Ukraine,"CNN — Ukraine has stabilized the northern Kharkiv front after Moscow launched an offensive a month ago, thanks to more weapons and permission to use them to target positions within Russia . But its forces are being stretched elsewhere along the 1,000km (620 miles) long front line and are defenseless against Russia’s deadly aerial glide bombs. A senior officer in Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), who goes by the call sign Bankir, and is currently fighting in the Kharkiv region , told CNN the ability to hit Russian targets across the border was already having a positive impact. “It is now possible to conduct local counter-attack operations and recapture the territories that, for example, were captured by the enemy a week ago,’ the SBU officer said. For much of the war, Ukraine has been constrained when it comes to using powerful Western weapons against Russia. Kyiv’s allies have long been adamant that their fighting machines must not strike within Russian territory for fear of provoking Moscow, limiting their use to targets within Ukraine, including in occupied areas. But that changed in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. First, European countries including France and Germany allowed Ukraine to strike targets within Russia , then, most significantly, the US gave the go ahead for Ukraine to use its weaponry around Kharkiv . “Our policy using long-range strike weaponry to go into Russia hasn’t changed, but what we have done is provide Ukraine the ability to counterfire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they’re firing at the Ukrainians and I think that’s going to prove to be very, very helpful to Ukraine going forward,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Smoke rises after a Russian missile strike in Kharkiv on May 17. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters The US HIMARS system has become the go-to weapon system to hit the Russian positions, according to Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence. Due to the threat of being hit by HIMARS, the Russians have begun to use S-300 and S-400 missile systems much less to fire at the Kharkiv region but glide bombs remain an issue . These are dropped from so high they are out of range of Ukrainian defenses. “Unfortunately, we do not yet have permission to hit Russian aircraft at airfields with American weapons and we do not have permission to use ATACMS missiles on Russian territory,” said Cherniev, referring to a long-range missile system. “Because of this, we have not yet been able to resolve the problem of glide bomb strikes on our territory. Kharkiv and other border areas are still suffering from bombing attacks, and a lot of civilians die.” While the Russian advance has slowed as assessed by the US and Ukraine, Moscow’s forces continue to press along the new front line in the north. Russians are focusing on trying to push through the village of Hlyboke north of Kharkiv. If Russian forces manage to take hold there they could push through to the village of Lyptsi which sits 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv – bringing the city with historic, cultural and industrial importance within artillery range.

The fighting has turned to close combat, with units fighting street by street, according to Nazar Voloshyn, a Ukrainian military spokesman in the east. But “most of the city is under the control of the Ukrainian Defense Forces” Voloshyn told CNN. “To disperse the forces and means of our defense forces, the enemy launched an additional Kharkiv campaign… they partially succeeded, but the defense forces stabilized the situation,” said Yurii Fedorenko, a company commander with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently fighting in the Kharkiv region. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a “significant increase” (31%) in civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April. According to HRMMU, more than half of the casualties occurred in the new northern front and because of “air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the front line and Kharkiv city.” The Institute for the Study of War with AEI’s Critical Threats Project Related article Russia opens a new front: Mapping three key battles in the Ukrainian war To counter the Russians in Kharkiv, Ukraine has to divert men and arms from other parts of the front line in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A main goal for Russia has been to exert complete control over the two eastern regions. And that’s exactly where Russia has been pressing quite actively, according to Voloshyn. In the east, Moscow had set its sites on on the town of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. Russian troops have made some advances. Further south along the eastern front line, Russians have made advances to the west of the city of Avdiivka which fell to Russian forces in February. “The Russian army is trying to do everything possible on the front line before the arrival of US aid to Ukraine and is trying to use this window of opportunity in all possible ways,” according to Voloshyn. Russians are trying to seize the momentum as the weather and daylight hours make conditions more conducive to ground operations. They are also in race against the clock before more arms arrive from Ukrainian partners, particularly as the West is slowly coming around to allowing Ukraine to use the weapons on Russian territory. NATO F16s are expected to arrive shortly and France has pledged to equip Ukraine wih its Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets. Western weapons and a new push to draft more soldiers in to the Ukrainian military could give Ukraine the boost it needs."

Kherson and Luhansk were among four Ukrainian territories Russia claimed to have annexed in September 2022 following its full-scale invasion. The international community, aside from North Korea and Syria, does not recognize the annexation. Vladimir Saldo, the Russia-appointed governor of the southern Kherson region , accused Ukrainian forces of killing 22 people, including a 9-year-old child, in the shelling of the small town of Sadove on Friday. Saldo claimed that Ukrainian forces did “a double-tap” missile strike on a grocery store and the civilian area in Sadove. The grocery store, he noted, was packed with customers and staff when it was hit. The first attack was carried out using a French-supplied aerial bomb and the successive one with an American-supplied HIMARS missile, he told Russia 24. Meanwhile, the Russian-appointed head of the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic, Leonid Pasechnik, said on Telegram a Ukrainian strike on Luhansk killed three people and wounded 35 others. A rescuer rests next to a destroyed residential building in Luhansk. AFP/Getty Images A woman cleans debris from an apartment. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the strikes “cynical and [a] bloody crime” on Friday and blamed Washington for giving “the green light” to Kyiv “to kill civilians with Western weapons.” Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson region military administration, dismissed the Russian claims in a Telegram post on Friday, calling them “a vivid example of how Russian propaganda works.”  Prokudin pointed to Saldo incorrectly citing the attack in Kherson region as happening on Saturday instead of Friday, in an insinutation the claim was made up. Artem Lysohor, head of Luhansk region military administration, said that the Ukrainian strikes were “exclusively on the old and well-equipped military infrastructure of the occupiers” and blamed Russian air defense systems for intercepting the rockets over civilian neighborhoods, suggesting the falling debris caused casualties. Russia has been pressing in the east, which it seeks to capture in full, as it continues its assault on Ukraine’s northeastern region of Kharkiv after launching a surprise offensive last month. Ukraine recorded its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost one year, with the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recording a “significant increase” (31%) in civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April. “Over half of the casualties in May occurred in Kharkiv city and region where Russian armed forces launched a new ground offensive on 10 May,” the head of the HRMMU Danielle Bell said. Bell attributed the increase to Russia’s move to use “air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the frontline and Kharkiv city.”"

CQ Brown, and more than 20 other heads of state including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Austin’s comments came days after Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russian territory — though limiting it to targets close to the border of Kharkiv where Russian forces have been concentrating their efforts — with US munitions. Asked about waning support in the US, Austin said he believed there has been “strong support for Ukraine” among both political parties, despite how long it took for Congress to pass its security aid package for the embattled country and emphasized that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely won’t stop at Ukraine. “I was confident that the right thing was going to happen, because anytime you see that type of support on both sides of the aisle for a cause, Congress will find a way to get things done. Which is what they did in this case, because it’s the right thing to do,” he said. “And Ukraine matters … not just for Ukraine’s purposes alone, not for Europe alone — it matters for to us and it matters to the entire globe. So, we have to make sure that Putin doesn’t have the ability to trample Ukraine because as the president said there’s a good chance, almost certain, that Putin won’t stop there. He will continue to move forward in other acts of aggression.” On Thursday, Biden gave a blistering critique of Putin, telling ABC News’ David Muir that Putin is “not a decent man, he’s a dictator.” Standing in the Normandy American Cemetery, Austin told CNN he believed the “number of leaders who lean towards autocracy” around the globe pose the greatest threat to the US, and that the sacrifice so many gave to “ensure our freedom” should never be forgotten. “[I]t’s those sacrifices that really gave birth to the rules-based international order that served us so well for so many years,” he said. “And we have to protect that — we have to work hard to protect it. Democracy is worth having, but it’s something that you have to work on, you have to fight for.” ‘Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people’ Austin declined on Thursday to comment on an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza on a UN-run school that was housing displaced people, which killed at least 45 people, saying he would “leave it to Israel to talk about what happened in that strike.” He emphasized though that Israel must take more actions to avoid civilian casualties, and that accomplishing their military objectives and protecting civilians should not be mutually exclusive. “I think the way you ensure long-term success is by making sure that you take the civilian population, eventually strip them away from Hamas, and demonstrate that Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people,” Austin said. Asked if he believes Israel has committed war crimes in its operations against Hamas in Gaza, Austin echoed Biden’s comments that it is “uncertain” and should be investigated, which he said Israel would be doing. “This is a professional force,” he said, “and we would expect they do the kinds of things that professional forces do, you know, make sure they’re doing the right things to employ the weapons appropriately, and also if there are problems, investigate those problems and learn from that.” So far, Austin said, the US has still not seen Israel begin a “major movement into Rafah.” US and China must ‘continue to have a dialogue’ Austin also spoke briefly on Thursday about challenges in the Indo-Pacific and his recent meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Adm. Dong Jun, in Singapore. He reiterated that it is important for the US and China to “continue to have a dialogue” and that he voiced concerns over what is happening in the region. Just two weeks ago, China launched military drills encircling Taiwan after the democratic island swore in a new president. “I voiced my concerns about some of the things that we’ve seen in the region, and we’ll continue to do so going forward,” Austin said. “But unless you’re talking to each other, you don’t have the ability to prevent miscalculations and address misperceptions. So I think this is a good first step, but there’s a lot more that needs to be done in terms of engaging and in terms of moving things in the right direction.” This story has been updated with additional details."

Biden’s decision to loosen restrictions around the use of US weapons in Ukraine came after Russia made significant advances around the city in the northeastern part of the country close to the Russian border. While it marked a break from long-standing policy, it is limited to the area around Kharkiv , and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, a US official previously told CNN, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Wednesday, Putin warned Western countries they’re taking a “very serious and dangerous step” by supplying weapons to Ukraine, which could result in Moscow arming their enemies. “Supplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,” Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. “Especially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.” Biden, however, insisted Thursday, “They’re authorized to be used in proximity to the border. We’re not authorizing strikes 200 miles into Russia, we’re not authorizing strikes on Moscow, on the Kremlin.” The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration’s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes."

Ukraine has relied heavily on arms supplied by Western allies to beat back Russian forces since Putin’s full-scale invasion began more than two years ago. And last week, US President Joe Biden for the first time gave Kyiv permission to use American munitions to carry out limited strikes inside Russian territory, after several European nations removed restrictions on how weapons they supply can be used. “Supplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,” Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. “Especially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.” Putin also warned that Russia could retaliate if Western countries are deemed to have become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict. “In the end, if we see that these countries become involved in a war against us, what they are doing makes them directly involved in a war against the Russian Federation, we reserve the right to act the same way,” he said. “Overall, it leads to some serious problems.” And he raised the prospect of retaliatory action by asking why Russia would “not have the right to supply our weapons of the same class to those regions of the world where there will be strikes on the sensitive facilities of those countries that are doing this against Russia?” A handheld drone detection jammer is displayed during a worldwide state security exhibition in Villepinte, a suburb of Paris, France, on November 14, 2023.

Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, said the American weapons had allowed them “to significantly reduce the shelling of Kharkiv by Russian S-300 missiles.” In his comments Wednesday, Putin said Russia would improve air defense systems to destroy incoming missiles. He also singled out Berlin for criticism, following remarks last week from the leaders of France and Germany that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. The appearance of German tanks in Ukraine had resulted in an “ethical shock” in Russia, where the attitude toward Germany had previously been “very good,” Putin said. “Now, when they say that some more missiles will appear that will strike targets on Russian territory, this, of course, is ultimately destroying Russo-German relations,” he added.

Alexander Kazakov/AFP/Getty Images Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on May 28, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons – including the United States – and international law. “Ukraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,” Scholz said. “I find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.” Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, knowing that its troops could retreat to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles)."

So when his phone kept pinging while on location, he knew it wasn’t them. It was the app used by many locally that tells users when a bomb is incoming. “I didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t know what to expect,” Zeman, director of the upcoming film “Checkpoint Zoo,” told CNN in an interview. “We went and wore flak jackets and helmets and we were there filming and bombs were going off, the whole nine yards.” The notifications went off so frequently that the crew had to turn them off at times, hoping to earn a moment of silence until the inevitable sound of the bombs exploding miles away from their filming location broke it. Both the bombs and the notifications were a constant reminder to Zeman that he was trying to make a movie during a 21st century war. Zeman made multiple trips Ukraine to capture footage for “Checkpoint Zoo,” a documentary that tells the story of the harrowing rescue of thousands of animals that were trapped inside Kharkiv’s Feldman Ecopark zoo amid the conflict. It will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on June 6. The story in his film, he said, was too important not to tell. The victims you never see Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022 launched an assault on Ukraine by land , air and sea. The ongoing conflict , over two years later , has since left tens of thousands of troops and civilians dead. The Feldman Ecopark facility, located in Kharkiv near the Russian border, became one of the unwitting casualties of the war when the heavy fighting in the area left the park’s 5000 animals with little food, water and caretakers. But after the park’s founder, businessman and philanthropist Oleksandr Feldman, posted a video to his social media pages asking the world for help , resources were sent and a group of volunteers showed up to help bring the animals to safety. Six people died during the evacuation, including a 15-year-old boy . Volunteers help push a camel onto the truck so that he can be successfully evacuated from Feldman Ecopark in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Carol Guzy/Ghost Robot Zeman first learned of Feldman Ecopark’s animal rescue after he saw a video of a Chimpanzee named ChiChi wandering around Kharkiv’s Freedom Square. Intrigued, he was determined to find the Chimp’s origin story, which led him to learning the full scope of Feldman Ecopark’s animal evacuation. Soon thereafter, Zeman connected with a representative for the park and traveled to Kharkiv with his crew to film. “This is a film about the unintended victims of war that you don’t quite see,” Zeman said. Zeman reconstructs the events of the evacuation in “Checkpoint Zoo” using interviews conducted under the constant threat of artillery fire while on the ground in Ukraine and footage filmed by volunteers. Led by a team of heroic zookeepers and volunteers, the film highlights the people who risked their lives to save the animals of Feldman Ecopark. But getting there was no easy task. Zeman spent 12 hours at the Warsaw border on his way into Ukraine trying to explain to border officials that his luggage was full of film equipment. Peppered with questions about why he was trying to cross into Ukraine and what he was trying to film, Zeman attempted to explain that he was not a journalist, nor was he heading to the front lines – a concept that he remembers being confusing to officials. “‘We’re going to film a zoo,’” Zeman recalled telling officials at the time. “That just blew everybody’s mind at the border.” In what ultimately turned into a five day trek from Warsaw to Kharkiv, the filmmaker was finally on-site to capture footage of the park, which was beholden to the scars of war and empty of the 5000 animals that were re-homed to safer havens across the country months prior. 'Checkpoint Zoo' director Joshua Zeman. Jennifer Manville/Ghost Robot “It was crazy that this was going on,” Zeman said. “I spoke to so many people whose lives had been impacted…It was horrific what was going on and coming from the United States, coming from New York, it’s just shocking.” The language barrier at times presented a challenge. Zeman relied heavily on his translator to relay his questions and the subject’s answers. But, he said, “I just knew that the story was important and that the people were important and what they were saying was emotional.” The footage Feldman, a Ukrainian businessman and Jewish philanthropist, first opened the park in 2011 with the initial vision that it’d be a small park for children to play with animals, according to producers of the documentary. It eventually evolved into a sprawling facility that housed everything from moose and kangaroos to lions and monkeys. Feldman Ecopark also focused on rehabilitation and instituted programs for special needs children and for people struggling with addiction. During the evacuation, Feldman and his team relocated a significant amount of the animals from the park to his nearby home. In the film, Feldman’s home – full of animals – is highlighted as he tearfully speaks about his connection to them and his quest to save them. The human cost of Feldman’s grand effort was spoken about by many in the documentary but shown in graphic detail through the story of 15-year-old Denis Selevin, who was killed in a strike on the facility’s grounds. In one scene, the child’s father, Vitalii Selevin, confronts a Russian prisoner of war who was captured by the Ukrainian military following the strike. “This is the blood of my child,” Vitalii Selevin tells man the restrained in the clip, after kneeling down to show him his bloodied hands. “How am I supposed to feel about you?” A volunteer for the animal evacuation at Feldman Ecopark helps direct the high-risk rescue amidst the debris of Russian missiles in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Carol Guzy/Ghost Robot Denis Selevin had died just minutes before this encounter. He had been at the facility that day helping evacuate and feed the animals when the park had come under fire by Russian troops. “The footage was unbelievable, it was shocking,” Zeman said. “It was also amazing too because it happened on the last day of the evacuation. It’s like a script.” Zeman said he didn’t even realize they had this footage at the time. He and his team knew at the time that Denis Selevin lost his life and thought they’d have to tell his story through photographs. So when an editor first uncovered the footage, Zeman said he felt that it was “very important” that they spoke to his parents on their next trip to Ukraine. “I was surprised that they agreed to speak on camera,” he said. They ultimately agreed, according to Zeman, because “they wanted the world to see what war can do.” It’s a sentiment that is consistent through each testimonial featured in “Checkpoint Zoo.” Andrii Tyvaniuk, a Feldman Ecopark employee who helped with the evacuation says at one point in the film that “not all animals are animals, and not all humans are humans.” “But many animals are humans,” he continued. “And a whole lot of people are animals.”"

Engulfed in violence, Burkina Faso has been named the world’s most neglected displacement crisis for the second year, by the NRC. In 2024, 6.3 million people in the country will need humanitarian assistance, the aid organization said, with over two million people internally displaced. US officials have warned for years now that both Russia and China are working to build influence in Africa. In 2019, the former head of US Africa Command, Gen.

Isolated from much of the world due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia appears to be renewing overtures in the continent. In early March of this year, Africa Command again warned Congress that Russia was aggressively working to expand its footing in Africa, and that several countries were “at the tipping point” of falling under its influence. In his comments this week, Lavrov also thanked Burkinabe leaders for their “effective assistance in resolving issues that allowed us to resume the activities of our embassy in Ouagadougou.” “We are implementing a program to resume the activities of Russian diplomatic missions in Africa. Burkina Faso was the first country to do this quickly and effectively,” he said."

The vote passed during an extraordinary parliament session after numerous procedural hurdles, according to the outlet. “Today is a historic day! The National Assembly of Slovenia has officially recognized Palestine, making Slovenia the 147th country to do so,” Slovenia’s Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said in a series of posts on social media. “This recognition is an expression of our commitment to peace and justice. Slovenia is on the right side of history, contributing to the two-state solution for lasting peace,” Fajon said. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least 36,550 Palestinians and injured another 82,959 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures.

Amid the rising toll, Israel has come under increasingly fierce criticism. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned “the continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas . Slovenia’s foreign minister said the country believes only a two-state solution can lead to a lasting peace in the Middle East and that her country “will tirelessly continue to work on the security of both nations, Palestinians and Israelis.” The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, with many nations believing it is the only way out of the long-running conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed the idea of two states in 2009 under pressure from the Obama administration, but more recently has said that recognizing a Palestinian state post-October 7 would be a “reward for terror.” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of Israel’s ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland after the countries’ decision last month. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes during what Palestinians call al-Nakba, or “the catastrophe,” of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.

It’s a Russian S-300. On Russian territory. The first days after permission to use Western weapons on enemy territory,” Ukrainian government minister Iryna Vereshchuk posted on Facebook alongside a picture purporting to show the strike. This comes just days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons can be used. It is unclear if the weapons used in the strike described by Vereshchuk were US-supplied. Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, safe in the knowledge that its troops could retreat back to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The permission granted by the US was both groundbreaking and bold, but tentative and highly conditional. Ukraine can only hit targets around Kharkiv, and the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). For that reason, military analysts praised the decision, but tempered expectations. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine “to hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.” Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow at UK-based Chatham House, told CNN the policy change was “not a game changer, per se. It’s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on June 2. Edgar Su/Reuters Related article Zelensky says China’s ‘support to Russia’ will extend war in Ukraine during surprise appearance in Asia While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has already experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory to which it lays claim. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using “Storm Shadow” missiles provided by the United Kingdom . Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the war. Then as now, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials rattled the nuclear saber in an attempt to deter Western support. Before Biden gave Kyiv the green light, Putin said the decision could lead to “serious consequences,” particularly for “small and densely populated countries.” The US joined several other European countries, including the UK, France and Germany, in removing this particular restriction on how Ukraine can use the weapons it has been given. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Biden’s decision to allow some strikes in Russian territory as a “step forward” that will help his forces defend the embattled Kharkiv region."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl/index.html,Burkina Faso named most neglected crisis for second year in a row,Burkina Faso has been named the world’s most neglected displacement crisis by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for the second year.,"Jun 4, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Unknown,Ukraine,"CNN — Burkina Faso has been named the world’s most neglected displacement crisis by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for the second year. In its annual report , released Monday, the NRC said the West African country saw a record-high 707,000 new displacements in 2023, driven by escalating violence and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Nine out of the 10 most neglected crises outlined in the report were in Africa, with Cameroon, Central African Republic, Mali, and Niger holding the second to fifth positions respectively. The NRC said in a press release Monday its criteria for neglected displacement crises are: “lack of humanitarian funding, lack of media attention, and a lack of international political and diplomatic initiatives compared to the number of people in need.” The NCR report said 2023 saw a record-breaking shortfall in aid budgets of around $32 billion, leaving more than half of humanitarian needs worldwide unmet. Neglect now ‘the new normal’ The report said media coverage of the displacement crisis in Burkina Faso and international political engagement with the crisis were “negligible” in 2023, adding that only 37% of requested humanitarian funding had been received by the country, leaving a significant gap in aid. “The utter neglect of displaced people has become the new normal,” said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of NRC. “The local political and military elites disregard the suffering they cause, and the world is neither shocked nor compelled to act by stories of desperation and record-breaking statistics. We need a global reboot of solidarity and a refocus on where needs are greatest.” Rights groups have previously accused the military in junta-ruled Burkina Faso of attacking and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with militants in retaliatory operations. Sophie Garcia/AP Related article Burkina Faso army executed over 220 villagers in February, HRW says The report added that media coverage in Burkina Faso also declined as “access became more difficult for both journalists and humanitarian organisations.” Burkina Faso is currently under military rule after a junta staged a coup d’état in July 2022. Its junta, headed by acting president Captain Ibrahim Traore, has prioritized security due to the multiple lives claimed by attacks. But in April this year, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report found that more than 200 people were killed by the country’s military in a campaign against civilians accused of collaborating with armed groups, alleging these could amount to war crimes. Burkina Faso said it “firmly rejects and condemns such unfounded accusations,” in a government press release. The country’s media regulatory body, the Superior Council for Communication, announced in the following days it was temporarily suspending broadcasting and access to websites of some western news organizations including the French TV5 Monde and Le Monde, the Guardian , as well as BBC Africa and VOA . The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remained one of the most neglected crises for the eighth consecutive year, with around 6.9 million people displaced by the end of 2023, mainly in the eastern provinces, the report said. A lack of aid forced people to resort to negative coping mechanisms, including exchanging sexual favors for food, money, and other survival needs, the report stated. Sudan came in at number ten. Although the war which broke out in April last year has resulted in a death toll in the tens of thousands, more than eight million people internally displaced and nearly 25 million people in need of aid, the NRC remarked the crisis has been “grossly neglected.” Recurrent attacks Violence-related deaths in Burkina Faso doubled in 2023, according to the NRC. The country faces recurrent attacks often blamed on “terrorists.” In February last year, the murder of two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid workers led the organization to suspend activities in the region. By the end of the year, up to two million people were trapped in 36 blockaded towns, with over 40,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity, according to the report. A displaced mother in northern Burkina Faso, Asseta, shared her struggle with NRC researchers: “When we have nothing to cook, I pick leaves and boil them in water,” she said, as quoted in the organization’s release. Egeland emphasized the growing difficulty in reaching those in need due to dangerous roads and the prohibitively expensive minimal air services.

The NRC says around 6.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, with over two million remaining internally displaced. Hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks in February . The NRC’s report noted that many neglected crises are interconnected, with ripple effects beyond borders affecting neighboring countries and sometimes causing broader regional impacts. Competition over resources between refugees and local communities, driven by a lack of funds, can also cause tension."

The EU and several of its member countries have set up investigative agencies to counter disinformation ahead of the vote — and they are squarely focused on campaigns originating in Russia. Allegations of Russian disinformation around elections are nothing new — they have been a feature in the run-up to votes in the United States, United Kingdom and the EU before, though Russia has always denied waging such campaigns. But the tactics are becoming more sophisticated, and are leaping from online platforms into parliaments and public discourse. The European Parliament building in Belgium, Brussels Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu/Getty Images Related article Why predicted gains for right-wing populists could make Europe vulnerable to attack Artificial intelligence and deepfakes are quickly becoming the tools of choice by those looking to spread false narratives, said Morgan Wright, chief security advisor for SentinelOne, an American cybersecurity company. SentinelOne, alongside the independent research group EU DisinfoLab, has worked to uncover a Russia-based influence network operating in Europe since 2022 dubbed “Doppelgänger.” The network puts out clone sites of prominent European media organizations, including major publications like the Guardian and Bild in Germany, as vehicles to spread misleading and false content. There is a focus on fake stories to influence attitudes on subjects like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. But for the past year, the climate crisis has been the second-most targeted subject, according to the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO). One such fake story, published on a website mimicking Bild, described how a teenage cyclist bled to death after streetlights were turned off to save electricity. The fake article claimed the German government cut the lights because of an energy crisis fueled by sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine. Before the war, Germany had relied heavily on Russian gas for energy. The story was debunked by numerous German media outlets, but continued spreading on Facebook. Paula Gori, EDMO’s secretary general, said that spreading false climate narratives fits in with Russia’s geopolitical goals as the country’s lucrative oil and gas sector has been hit with sanctions and an EU ban on imports. “It’s quite easy for Russians to spread disinformation that the EU is struggling because of the sanctions, and European citizens are struggling because there is no gas from Russia,” she said. False narratives that renewables are doing little for the EU’s energy security have also emerged, Gori said. Official statistics, however, tell a different story: In 2022, renewables accounted for 23% of the energy consumed in the EU. Some European countries are now using more renewable energy than fossil fuels. EU DisinfoLab found other stories falsely claiming wind turbines were causing toxic pollution. The aim also appears to be to sow confusion and division, rather than to bring about a change in climate policy, Wright said. “Russia has been very opportunistic. It’s looking for controversy and strife, and any current issues that they can exploit,” he said. “The goal is to get (people) fighting with each other. They don’t care about climate policy.” French farmers tractors arrive to block a highway on the border between Spain and France during a protest in Biriatou, southwestern France, on June 03, 2024. Gaizka Iroz/AFP/Getty Images Russia has another interest in undermining the EU’s messaging on climate. As it seeks to strengthen its relations in the Global South, particularly in Africa and Asia, where it is competing with the West for business and influence, it is trying to depict Europe’s climate policies to exploit poorer countries and stop them from industrializing, Gori said. This idea of using disinformation to widen existing divisions is straight from Russia’s old disinformation handbook, according to Wright. “If you go back to 1917, to the creation of Cheka, the first of Russia’s intelligence organization, they’ve been the masters at disinformation for over 100 years,” he said. “They’ve been using the same tactics for decades, it’s the tools that change — now it’s artificial intelligence and social media.” Forced to eat insects? Campaigns that begin online are seeping into Europe’s parliaments, where populist politicians are peddling some of the same false narratives. Politicians in France and Italy have shared false news that climate policies to cut pollution from farming will force EU citizens to eat insects, while people in Croatia, Germany and Poland were told politicians in England were imposing “climate lockdowns” on their citizens and similar restrictions could be coming to their countries. The campaigns are having real-life consequences, particularly for the EU’s Green Deal legislation, the bloc’s overarching vision for climate action. The EU is considered a global leader in tackling planet-heating pollution, but climate disinformation could undermine the bloc’s ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2040, compared with 1990 levels. That umbrella goal is already under threat. The“green wave” that brought many climate-focused politicians to power in the 2019 European elections looks to be over, with green parties predicted to suffer heavy losses this month, which would mean fewer progressive climate voices in parliament. Other fake stories have targeted the EU’s agricultural policies, most notably through farmers protests that swept through a number of EU states, including France, Germany, Spain and Poland this year.

Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images Related article With shake-up at defense ministry, ‘Putin’s chef’ gets his wish from beyond the grave Gori said EDMO’s researchers found clear evidence of attempts to hijack the protests, which started as grassroots initiatives over genuine farmer concerns. She pointed to a widely shared false story claiming famers in France and Spain would be “booted off their land” to make way for solar plants. There were many reasons farmers took to the streets, but some of the perceived negative impacts of green farming proposals led to the EU dropping or diluting a number of the policies. The EU scrapped a plan to cut the use of pesticides in half by 2030, and it delayed new rules on soil health and biodiversity. It also dropped a requirement to cut non-carbon greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture . “The protests were legitimate, of course … but they were used and exploited by Russia to share disinformation that attacks the EU institutions and causes polarization,” Gori said. Pallavi Sethi, a climate change misinformation policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, said climate is just the latest in a string of issue some far-right politicians have targeted to stoke division. Before climate, it was migration. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), for example, has weaponized the debate around heat pumps . When the ruling coalition government proposed phasing out home heating systems running on methane gas, the AfD branded them an “eco-dictatorship” and made the issue a key part of its campaign, despite scientific evidence showing the climate benefits of electrifying heating. “Right-wing populism political ideology often emphasizes the rights of ordinary citizens and demonizes the ‘corrupt elite’ — the governments who want to do something about climate change, who are forming these climate policies, and the scientific community that is providing evidence,” she said.

But can it deliver? The EU’s answer to the problem has been its Digital Services Act, which specifically targets illegal content, misleading advertising and disinformation. It has been using the new legislation to force big social media companies to clean up their platforms. Most recently, the European Commission — part of the EU’s executive government — opened formal proceedings against Facebook and Instagram over disinformation targeting the European election. And last month, the EU imposed sanctions on the Prague-based Voice of Europe, an online media outlet that it accused of running a pro-Russian influence operation. Voice of Europe could not be reached as its contact page shows an error message. But these efforts can only go so far to address what has become an enormous problem. Climate Action Against Disinformation, an international coalition of groups, said the response by social media companies and governments has been woefully inadequate. CNN in February reported on a fake AI-generated audio recording of a top candidate in Slovakia “admitting” he would rig the parliamentary elections, which was published on Facebook just days before a key vote last fall. A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said in a statement at the time: “Our independent fact-checking network reviews and rates misinformation — including content that’s AI-generated — and we label it and down-rank it in feed so fewer people see it.” While the statement said content that violates company policies is removed, it did not address why some posts containing the Slovak deepfake were not marked as false. Facebook has removed content that breaches its policies for several years, but it does not automatically remove content just because it has been doctored or generated by AI. Instead, it aims to label altered content as such. Its community standards policy in the past had only targeted video, but in April, it was expanded to include audio. In Slovakia, however, the damage may have already been done . The candidate targeted — a pro-Western politician — was defeated by another with close ties to Moscow. “There was a flaw in how Meta — Facebook — looked at stuff. They would only take down things if it was a video that was doctored,” Wright said. “They had no policy on taking down doctored audio. That was a flaw, and they exploited it.”"

Zelensky made the comments in Singapore during a surprise appearance at a meeting of defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China and the US. It comes ahead of the international peace conference on Ukraine slated to be held June 15-16 in Switzerland. “With China’s support to Russia the war will last longer. That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China – who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,” Zelensky said during a press conference. China claims neutrality in the conflict and has said it is a proponent of peace, even as it has emerged as a key economic lifeline and tightened its already close strategic and diplomatic partnership with Russia since the country’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The US has also alleged that China’s export of dual-use goods to Russia is powering the warring country’s defense industrial base and warned Beijing of consequences for such support – a claim Beijing has refuted, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods. Zelensky alluded to such support in comments Sunday, saying certain elements that make up parts of Russia’s weaponry “come from China.” The Ukrainian leader also warned that Russia was attempting to pressure countries not to join the upcoming international peace summit – with China’s help. “Russia is trying to disrupt the peace summit and that is true … (Russia) is now traveling around many countries in the world threatening them with the blockade of the agricultural goods, of the food products, of chemical products … it is simply pushing the other countries of the world so that they’re not present on the summit,” Zelensky said after delivering an address at the defense conference.

Getty Images Related article US and Chinese defense chiefs hold first in-person talks since 2022 When asked later about China’s statement it would not attend the peace summit, the Ukrainian leader accused Russia of using Chinese diplomats to disrupt it. “Regrettably, it is unfortunate that such big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,” Zelensky said, speaking through an interpreter. The Ukrainian leader added that he had not had any meetings with Chinese representatives in Singapore, despite interest on the Ukrainian side for more dialogue. China last week said it would not send a delegation to the peace summit, saying any international peace conference should have “recognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.” Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun in an address earlier Sunday said China had been “promoting peace talks with a responsible attitude.” Dong also appeared to respond to US allegations that China is bolstering Russia’s defense industrial base with dual-use exports, saying in his remarks that China has not provided weapons to either side in the conflict and had put “stricter control” on dual-use exports. US defense chief Lloyd Austin raised those transactions with Dong during a sideline meeting Friday, where he warned of consequences for any Chinese support of Russia’s military. When asked about Zelensky’s comments dur﻿ing a regular press briefing in Beijing Monday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry defended China’s trade with Russia as “above board,” adding it was “certainly not against the peace summit” and there was “no pressure on other countries.” “We also attach great importance to our relations with Ukraine … China and Ukraine have maintained communication and cooperation since the Ukrainian crisis escalated,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. ‘Time is running out’ The Ukrainian leader’s in-person appeal at the Shangri-La Dialogue comes as Ukraine’s troops scramble to repel a major Russian advance into its northeast region of Kharkiv amid shortages of weaponry and manpower more than two years into Russia’s invasion – raising the urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan. Zelensky’s plan calls for the full withdrawal of Russian forces and a restoration of Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. The Ukrainian leader has previously said he won’t negotiate with Russia until its forces withdraw. “Time is running out” including for Ukrainian children taken by Russia, Zelensky told a packed hall during an address on the closing day of the three-day security meeting. The summit, he said, would address three points of his peace formula, including “nuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war,” as well as “Ukrainian children abducted by Russia” and enable countries to come to a consensus on peace in Ukraine that could be “passed to Russia.” The International Criminal Court in The Hague last year issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia.

The upcoming peace summit and Ukraine’s defense were also key topics for Zelensky as he held sideline meetings since arriving in Singapore on Saturday. Those included talks with US Defense Secretary Austin, Indonesia’s President-Elect Prabowo Subianto, and Timor-Leste’s President José Ramos-Horta, as well as a delegation of American lawmakers. In his meeting with Zelensky Sunday morning, Austin reiterated “unwavering US support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression” and provided an update on American security assistance to Ukraine, according to a readout from Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder after the meeting. Zelensky said in a post on Twitter that the two sides discussed “the defense needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine’s air defense system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement.” He also thanked US President Joe Biden for “an important decision” regarding defensive strikes with American weapons, in reference to the White House’s decision, as reported by CNN, to permit Ukraine to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory.

Now he is among the Ukrainian soldiers being treated in Berlin.,"Jun 3, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Nadine Schmidt,Ukraine,"Berlin CNN — Pavlo Kushnirov was among the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut with the 114th territorial defense brigade on a sunny day last winter when Russian shelling changed his life forever. “For two days our unit was under heavy bombardment from Russian artillery and drones. That morning – on 5 December – the shells found me,” the 43-year-old bearded soldier, who now uses a wheelchair, told CNN in Berlin, as he pointed to where his legs should be. Instead, there are two stumps: One of his legs is amputated just below the knee joint, the other is amputated above the knee. Fellow Ukrainian soldier Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov, 42, served in the 19th Separate Rifle Battalion in Chervonopopivka, on the front line where Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions meet. His left leg was torn off during a battle with Russian forces on July 1 last year. “I immediately put a tourniquet on myself and luckily remained conscious. On adrenaline, I guess, I saved myself,” he said. His right leg sustained serious injuries with an open fracture and eventually had to be amputated in Lviv, he told CNN earlier this month in Berlin. For three months he was confined to his hospital bed. Russia’s war against Ukraine has killed tens of thousands and left even more with lost limbs and other life-altering injuries since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. German officials estimate there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Ukrainian amputees as a result of the conflict. Obtaining adequate prosthetic limbs and care is tough inside Ukraine. Now a German non-governmental organization is working to bring wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Berlin so they can be fitted with custom-made artificial limbs and given treatment that will allow them to lead as normal a life as possible. Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov are among the first of 60 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers who will receive treatment in Germany, thanks to the Berlin-based NGO “Life Bridge Ukraine.” They hope to start what they see as a new life soon. “My doctor called and said there was an opportunity to go abroad for me to receive prosthetics. So, I said OK,” Vitaliy said. “Once there were hundreds of us, now there are thousands of people like me.” Orthopedic technicians work with Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov, seated center, and Pavlo Kushnirov, right, who are among the first of 60 injured Ukrainian soldiers who will receive specialist treatment in Berlin. Limbs amputated quickly to save lives Marko Gänsl, from German health care company Seeger, is among five orthopedic technicians in Berlin who build custom-made prostheses for the soldiers. When CNN visited the wounded soldiers in their accommodation center for the first time, Gänsl was assessing the new patients. Bending over Kushnirov’s leg stumps, he softly felt along them. “Are you in pain?” he asked. Kushnirov shook his head as a translator relayed the question. “Let me know if anything hurts,” Gänsl said, taking out a tape to measure the stumps. He and other orthopedic technicians assessed the condition of Kushnirov’s limbs. Battlefield conditions in Ukraine mean limbs must often be amputated quickly to save soldiers’ lives. “The severity of the amputations often leave the survivors with stumps that won’t allow for the fitting of regular-sized prosthetics,” said Gänsl. “And of course we are dealing here with completely different requirements (than what orthopedic technicians are used to in Germany).” It will be relatively easy to provide a prosthesis for Kushnirov’s right leg, Gänsl said. However, his left leg will be more difficult to treat because it was amputated above the knee. Pavlo Kushnirov, left, is seen while serving in the Ukrainian military before losing his legs in a Russian attack last December. Pavlo Kushnirov Gänsl moved on to inspect the next patient: 27-year-old Valerii Omelchenko, who was drafted into the war three months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “I was on duty defending my country on November 23 last year when a Russian drone flew over me and a grenade exploded right in front of me,” he told CNN. “I jumped away and pulled my legs into my chest to protect myself from the explosion which I knew was coming. But look at my legs, they are injured badly.” Sitting in a wheelchair with his left leg amputated and the other one badly bruised and shattered, Omelchenko added: “But at least I am still alive.” Keen to save his damaged leg, doctors in Germany kept it in a metal frame, or external fixator, at first while it healed. That has just been removed and he will be fitted with a prosthesis on the other leg soon. Valerii Omelchenko, pictured during his time serving in the Donetsk area of Ukraine, was badly injured by a Russian grenade in November. Valerii Omelchenko A bridge between two capitals Janine von Wolfersdorff, a Berlin-based financial expert who became involved in humanitarian aid work in Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion, is the initiator of Life Bridge Ukraine, a project which is being run in partnership between the German and Ukrainian capitals. Under its auspices, experts in workshops in Berlin will make new limbs and teach the 60 patients chosen for treatment how to walk and move again. Von Wolfersdorff traveled to Ukraine herself with a medical team to assess some of the most seriously injured soldiers. “It’s a challenge to find the right patients in Ukraine. There are so many complex cases. At the same time, there are too few orthopedic technicians in Ukraine to provide all war victims with fast, adequate and good care,” she told CNN. “We want to give Ukrainian war-wounded soldiers a new life – and simultaneously want to train six Ukrainians for three months here in Berlin, who will learn to build very good quality prosthetics so that they can do it themselves in Kyiv.” Von Wolfersdorff is collaborating closely with Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko and Berlin’s Governing Mayor Kai Wegner on the project, hoping that a prosthetics center will be opened in Kyiv later this year. Ultimately, her group wants to open further prosthetics centres in other Ukrainian cities as well. “The trainees learn here first-hand when a stump may need another amputation, another surgery, when a scar needs to be attended to again, and other issues that arise during this very complex process,” Von Wolfersdorff said. Orthopedic technician Marko Gänsl examines Valerii Omelchenko for a prosthetic fitting on his left leg. His right leg was kept in a metal frame while it healed. Chris Stern/CNN CNN met with Ukrainian trainee Volodymyr Havrylov in the Seeger workshop. “It takes time to train to do it correctly and get every detail right,” he said. In the past few weeks, he has learnt that “surgeons need to make a good stump. The better the stump is, the easier for us to make a stump receiver.” Each patient requires a different treatment, Havrylov said, explaining that “sometimes the limb is too short, sometimes it is long – sometimes there is not enough space for the fitting. Sometimes patients still have pain somewhere.” Oftentimes there are other medical conditions that could influence the fitting of prosthetic limbs. Havrylov said he wants to learn “as much as possible from the Germans and maybe even get better at it so that we can open our center in Kyiv and help there. Unfortunately, there will be more people with injuries. We need good workshops to provide our Ukrainians with a good life. We need to bring them back into society.” Life Bridge Ukraine has collected around $600,000 in donations for the project, including for the care of the soldiers in Berlin. “It is a long process of recuperation,” Von Wolfersdorff said. “We seek a holistic treatment approach: In addition to a lot of physiotherapy, patients are offered psychological help, as well as nutritional advice, to reintegrate themselves into as normal as possible a life.” ‘Completely new way of learning to walk’ A few weeks later, CNN joined Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov for their first fittings in Seeger’s Berlin workshop. Vitaliy looked at his new artificial limbs and smiled. “These are my two legs,” he said, pointing at his new prosthetic limbs. “One and two. We are going to fit them today.” With the help of the medical and orthopedic technician teams Sayko-Kazakov took his first steps using them. “These are cool feet. Really fine work.” For Kushnirov, the initial fitting was trickier because of the artificial knee joint on one limb. “Unfortunately walking will be more difficult for him,” Gänsl explained. “It is a completely new way of learning how to walk.” Kushnirov knows his rehabilitation process will take time, but he is determined to keep trying. “It’s a shame I am losing so much time getting rehabilitated and I know it will still take me a lot of time. But of course, my life will improve,” he said. “But it’s hard to say what life will be like after my prosthetics fittings. I know it will be different.” Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov intends to help the war effort however he can when he returns to Ukraine. ""The war is not yet over. Our work is not yet finished,"" he said. Heiko Laschitzki Sayko-Kazakov, Kushnirov and the other soldiers with new artificial limbs will receive a lot of training on how to move again in the coming weeks in Berlin. Any final adjustments that are needed will be made before they receive their permanent prosthetic fittings and leave to be cared for back home in Ukraine. “It is a lot of fun working together with our highly motivated patients and Ukrainian trainees, we see so much progress,” Gänsl said. However, there will be challenges ahead for these soldiers even with their final artificial limbs. “Prosthetic fittings need to be adjusted again and again. It is a lifelong process,” he said. “After all, bodies change. Just as we occasionally put on weight over Christmas or lose weight when exercising, a stump does not grow with you.” Both Sayko-Kazakov and Kushnirov are determined to return to Ukraine soon, walking comfortably with their new artificial limbs. They say they﻿ are ready to support their units back home as they fight to fend off Russian forces. CNN’s Nick Patton Walsh talks to Oleksandr inside a bunker in Lyptsi, Ukraine.

When we go back, we can be useful on the home front, for example assembling drones.” Kushnirov acknowledges his limitations﻿. “I know I won’t be able to walk again just like others do. I won’t be able to fight at the front line anymore,” he said, “but there are a lot of other things I can do: I could operate a drone or take care of repair and maintenance works. Wherever I can help, I will do so. I will continue to fight for Ukraine.” CNN’s Claudia Otto and Chris Stern contributed to this report."

Traffic around the plant is “completely blocked,” he said, with residents being forced to drive over bridges to get around, he said. Russia has continued its tactic of striking key energy facilities this week, with the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy warning Sunday of a “significant power shortage” as a knock-on effect of the strikes. The ministry said that emergency blackouts were carried out in several regions of Ukraine after “six massive attacks.” Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said power facilities in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad, and Ivano-Frankivsk were hit, in what the ministry called “the sixth massive missile and drone strike on energy facilities since March 22.” The Institute for the Study of War with AEI’s Critical Threats Project Related article Russia opens a new front: Mapping three key battles in the Ukrainian war Russia’s defense ministry said these attacks were carried out “in response to attempts by the Kyiv regime to damage Russian energy and transport facilities.” Ukraine is on the back foot along the frontlines as it faces continued aerial assaults.

The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, attending a summit of defense chiefs in Singapore, called on countries across the Asia-Pacific to join an upcoming peace summit he accused Russia of trying to thwart. He thanked US President Joe Biden for “an important decision” to permit Ukraine to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory but said it was not enough. Last year, the Nova Kakhovka dam, a major dam and hydro-electric power plant in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine collapsed . The cause of the collapse is still not confirmed, though a number of civil engineering experts suggested that an explosion inside the structure was the most likely cause of the dam breach. Several Western officials blamed Russia for the disaster at the time, either directly accusing Moscow of targeting the dam or saying that Russia was responsible simply because it is the aggressor in the war on Ukraine. Russia denied any involvement in the disaster and in turn accused Ukraine of destroying the dam, without providing evidence. Ivana Kottasová and Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report."

It premieres Sunday, June 2 at 10pm ET/PT. CNN — Russia’s brutal ongoing invasion of Ukraine has provided US intelligence services with a rare opening to recruit Kremlin insiders furious with the handling of the war. “Disaffection creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us,” said CIA Director Bill Burns last year during a speech in the United Kingdom. “We’re very much open for business.” “That business is the exchange of information that the asset or agent would provide for something that they want,” said David McCloskey, former CIA officer and author of Moscow X . “We want people who have some sense of what [Russian] leaders’ priorities are – what they’re trying to accomplish.” The ongoing recruitment effort is far from a state secret. The CIA has released Russian-language videos on social media appealing to the patriotism of disaffected Russians with access to information that could be helpful to the US. The effort highlights the evolution of an intelligence service that has historically conducted its essential mission of countering national security threats and informing policymakers under a shroud of secrecy. A CIA source recruitment video on X, translated to: ""Why I contacted the CIA: For the sake of the Motherland"" CIA via X Indeed, until the CIA’s internally unpopular and short-lived director, James Schlesinger, finally posted a sign on a highway marking the site of the ultra-secret organization’s Virginia headquarters in 1973, its very location had been shielded from the public. Fast forward to today, when the spy agency is not only ubiquitous across social media platforms, it is actively using its newfound public-facing presence to accomplish one of CIA’s primary objectives: recruiting foreign spies to steal secrets. Posts have included step-by-step instructions for would-be Russian informants on how to avoid detection by Russia’s security services by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, and the Tor web browser to anonymously and through encryption contact the agency on the so-called Dark Web. The FBI launched a similar effort aimed at recruiting Russian government sources in the US, including geo-targeting social media ads to phones located near Russia’s embassy in Washington. “This direct appeal is an unusual approach, but one which could prove effective in reaching a Russian populace with few options to express their discontent,” said Douglas London, a former CIA station chief posted abroad. “Russians angry with the Kremlin’s state-sanctioned corruption and abuse, with no way to act openly, are left with few alternatives other than finding external support.” But while the technology is new, espionage has underpinned, and often undermined, US-Russian relations for decades. That secret battle between intelligence services is the focus of a new CNN-BBC documentary – “ Secrets and Spies ” – which premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. ET. With never before heard interviews from Cold War spies and the traitors who sealed their fate, “Secrets and Spies” tracks the operatives who worked behind the scenes to steal and share vital intelligence as the world stood on the brink of nuclear war. Over 30 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the world has returned to a period of great power conflict. In his latest book , CNN chief national security analyst Jim Sciutto describes it as “a definitive break between the post-Cold War era and an entirely new and uncertain one.” Russian Foreign Ministry building is seen behind a billboard showing Z, a tactical insignia of Russian troops in Ukraine, on October 13, 2022. Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Like the Cold War of the past, espionage remains a vital tool for both sides of the latest conflict, as evidenced by tech-savvy US intelligence officers attempting to recruit new assets in plain sight, and Russian-linked operatives reportedly increasing operations across Europe. While espionage is illegal in every nation in the world, and undercover operatives have certainly been used for nefarious purposes such as sabotage, assassination, and election interference, “Secrets and Spies” pulls back the veil on a lesser-known, historically critical function of spying: to reduce uncertainty and miscalculation among nuclear-armed adversaries. As the documentary underscores, the espionage lessons of the Cold War could very well determine future global stability. “You have to know your enemy,” said CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali. “If you don’t, you can scare your enemy into doing something that neither of you wants to see happen.” –CNN’s Sarah Moon, Alex Marquardt, and Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report"

Zelensky’s surprise attendance at the gathering is a stark illustration of Kyiv’s determination to keep the international community engaged in Ukraine’s defense – and its vision for peace – more than two years into Russia’s devastating invasion. The Ukrainian leader has traveled outside his embattled country sparingly during the war and earlier this month called off international engagements as his troops defended against the surprise Russian offensive in northeastern Kharkiv. A CNN team at the summit witnessed Zelensky and his delegation arriving. His attendance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore provides a rare opportunity for Zelensky to potentially meet with defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China which has deepened its relations with Moscow since the war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and defense heads from US allies Australia, Japan, and South Korea, as well as China’s Defense Minster Dong Jun are expected to be in attendance for the three-day gathering. Announcing his arrival at the summit, Zelensky said in a statement on X that he would hold “a number of meetings,” in particular with Austin, Singapore’s president and prime minister, Timor-Leste’s president and Singaporean investors. The pentagon confirmed on Saturday that Austin would meet Zelensky and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Shangri-La on Sunday, “to discuss the current battlefield situation in Ukraine and to underscore US commitment to ensuring Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression.” Ukrainian forces launch a rocket toward Russian positions in the Kharkiv region, on May 15, 2024. Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty Images Zelensky arrives in Singapore weeks ahead of a Ukraine-backed peace summit slated to be held in Switzerland amid a mounting urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan – especially in the face of the looming US presidential elections, which could see a shift in the level of US support for his cause. Ukraine relies squarely on international funds and weapons – and faces shortages of manpower and equipment. Months of political wrangling on Capitol Hill as well as lack of supplies from NATO countries have kept Ukraine’s forces significantly outgunned against Russia. A major $61 billion aid injection for Ukraine bill was finally passed by the US in late April. On Friday, Zelenksy was in Sweden for a summit with Northern European leaders where he said Ukraine’s “top priorities” were to ensure more air defense systems and weapons for Ukraine, as well as “global efforts to force Russia to make peace,” according to the leader’s post on the platform X. In Asia, Zelensky may carry a similar message. The conflict, though a continent away, has been watched closely by governments across the region, especially those contending with territorial disputes with another military and authoritarian power in the region, China. The Institute for the Study of War with AEI’s Critical Threats Project Related article Russia opens a new front: Mapping three key battles in the Ukrainian war The conflict in Europe is also widely seen to have impacted the security climate in Asia. Russia has nurtured a burgeoning relationship with North Korea, believed by Western governments to have supplied Russian forces with munitions in recent months. Moscow and Beijing have also deepened their strategic partnership during Russia’s war, with the US accusing China of bolstering Russia’s defense industrial base with dual-use exports – and divisions between China and the West deepening over Beijing’s close Kremlin ties. Those exports were raised during a meeting Friday between Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun. Austin indicated to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had honored its “promise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict” and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China’s spokesperson.

Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters Beijing also confirmed Friday that it would not send a delegation to the upcoming, Ukraine-backed peace conference in Switzerland, with its Foreign Ministry citing its view that any international peace conference should have “recognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.” Zelensky’s 10-point peace plan calls for Russia to withdraw all its troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. Zelensky has previously made surprise appearances at global summits to keep attention focused on Ukraine’s plight and strengthen ties – he famously dropped in on the Group of 7 (G7) summit last year in Japan. It’s not clear if he will have an opportunity to meet with any Chinese officials during his time in Singapore. Russia is not participating in the gathering.

After repelling Russia’s initial march on Kyiv, Ukraine has asked its Western allies for greater and greater support: first ammunition, then tanks, then cluster munitions, then fighter jets. Each time, the West has agonized over whether to grant Kyiv’s latest request, fearing escalation and a potential Russian response. Each time, the taboo was broken – and nothing happened. What seemed beyond the pale one week had become banal the next. But the rhythm of deliberation and delay has been hard to shake. Despite securing more weapons from the United States last month, Ukraine has not been able to use them as it pleases. As Moscow this month launched its surprise assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region, Washington forbade Kyiv from using US weapons to strike targets inside Russia. This too crumbled. President Joe Biden this week gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons they have given to Kyiv can be used. The Institute for the Study of War with AEI’s Critical Threats Project Related article Russia opens a new front: Mapping three key battles in the Ukrainian war “Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression” near Kharkiv city, “including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday on a visit to Prague, the Czech capital. He confirmed Biden had approved Ukraine’s request. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision as a “step forward” which will help his forces to defend the embattled Kharkiv region. While the decision may mark a new phase of the war, analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s invasion. Some are bullish. This month, the calls for the US to remove the restrictions became more desperate, as Russia continue to pummel Kharkiv city with missiles and make gains elsewhere in the region. Firefighters work at a hardware store targeted by a Russian air strike in Kharkiv, May 25, 2024. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters In a CNN op-ed , Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges described the bizarre effect of the US taboo: “We have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again.” “Ukraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call ‘time out’ in their own territory,” they wrote, urging Biden to call his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s bluff. But military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). Kateryna Stepanenko, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, told CNN the policy change will “blunt” Russia’s offensive in Kharkiv, but still “preserves the majority of Russia’s sanctuary space.” “The policy still protects Russia’s operational and deep rear sufficiently that this change near Kharkiv Oblast is insufficient to bring about a turning point in the war. Ukraine particularly needs the capacity to strike deep rear areas to defeat the Russian ground and air threats, as many Russian airfields that support strikes against Ukrainian cities are located outside of the allowed GMLRS range,” she said. Elderly Ukrainians wait to be evacuated from the city of Vovchansk as Russia advances in Kharkiv region, May 20, 2024. Narciso Contreras/Anadolu/Getty Images Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine “to hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.” “We need to be realistic about what can be expected from this policy change, since the Russian armed forces have already adapted to the introduction of ground-based precision fires,” he said. Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the policy change would allow Ukraine to “be more efficient when it comes to repelling attacks and pushing back preemptively.” “It’s not a game changer, per se. It’s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself,” he said. Red lines fade The US is joining the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several others in removing restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons it is given. Before Biden gave the green light, Putin had made veiled nuclear threats to countries considering allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with their weapons. He warned the move could lead to “serious consequences,” particularly for “small and densely populated countries.” As well as making nuclear threats, Putin also signaled earlier this month that he was open to peace talks . “All of these false narratives deliberately aimed to discourage Western decisionmakers from allowing Ukraine to preempt Russia’s attack on Kharkiv city,” Stepanenko said. cnn video Related video ‘Not sufficient’: Ukrainian soldiers detail how US-supplied tank is faring in war While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has previously experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory it considers its own. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using “Storm Shadow” missiles provided by the UK . Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion. In both cases, Russia had warned Ukraine and its Western allies not to cross its red line. In both cases, Ukraine and its Western allies ignored the warning. “The Kremlin already regards strikes against occupied Crimea and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts as ‘strikes against Russia,’ but the reality is that there are few things that Russia can do to further escalate its war in Ukraine without incurring major risks,” Stepanenko said.

The loosening of the restrictions marks a break from long-standing policy and comes amid growing international pressure from close US allies. But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv , and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the decision had been made following a request from Ukraine. “Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression” near Kharkiv, “including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,” Blinken said at a news conference in Prague. The top US diplomat said the request went to Biden, and he approved their use for that purpose. When asked if the door was open for the US to allow Ukraine to strike further into Russia, Blinken said the US would continue to “adapt and adjust” moving forward. “We want to make sure that we’re proceeding deliberately, as well as effectively,” he said. Politico was first to report the news. Kyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia. The administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or 300 kilometers , away. Ukraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia. Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration’s tact this week when he noted that the US could “adapt and adjust” its position. A hallmark of US support for Ukraine “has been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we’ve adapted and adjusted too,” Blinken said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. “I am confident we will continue to do that.” The previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. “Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,” Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. “So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we’re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we’re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?” “We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,” Macron continued. Germany’s Scholz echoed Macron’s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons – including the United States – and international law. The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration’s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes. Blinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia’s border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make sure to put Ukraine in a “position where it can deter and defend against future attacks.” “The US is feeling the weight of the argument,” said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming. In fact, the wheels were already in motion for Biden to amend the US policy when Blinken returned to Washington two weeks ago. According to US officials, the secretary of state signed on to a recommendation that had been made to Biden by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff C.Q. Brown in the days after Russia launched its offensive on May 10. On a May 13 secure video conference, the trio had heard appeals from their Ukrainian counterparts and determined that it made sense to lift the US restrictions so Ukrainian forces could hit the staging areas from which Russia was launching its attacks on Kharkiv. The head of US European Command, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, was brought into the conversation to help finalize the details. But it would take until Thursday for the US decision to work its way through the system and go into effect. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia, sources said. Stoltenberg’s repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit – and perhaps necessity – of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits. “To deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,” Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.

Mondelez said it was making its business in Russia “stand-alone” with a self-sufficient supply chain by the end of 2023. It appointed new leadership in Europe including Russia earlier this year. Mondelez’s rivals including Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, continue to sell their products in Russia. Food does not fall under international sanctions. While the plant in Trostyanets was being repaired, Mondelez imported Oreos to Ukraine, said a source familiar with the company’s plans, who is not permitted to speak to media. The company said products made in the Trostyanets plant are exported into Eurasian countries such as Georgia and Kazakhstan in addition to being sold in the domestic Ukrainian market. Plants in Russia previously helped supply those countries, the source said. “We continue to increase our investments in supporting and rebuilding Ukraine,” the company said in the statement. Mondelez previously told Reuters there were no more exports from Russia into Europe. Chocolate wafers with a cream vanilla filling, Oreos are one of Mondelez’s biggest brands, and hit about $4 billion in sales revenue last year, according to a LinkedIn post from CEO Dirk Van de Put. Mondelez’s other top brands include Milka and Cadbury chocolates. It also makes local-brand cookies and crackers. A little over 30% of Mondelez’s shareholders last week backed a resolution calling for the company to conduct an independent study of the risks of continuing to do business in Russia, according to a company filing. Norges Bank, Mondelez’s 11th-largest shareholder according to LSEG’s Eikon, backed the proposal, according to the fund’s disclosures. The fund said in the disclosure that when a company “does not meet our needs as a financial investor, we will consider supporting a well-founded shareholder proposal.”"

The assault, which began earlier this month, saw thousands of Russian soldiers punch through the northern border, and forced Ukraine to move in troops from other areas to defend positions. It serves as an example of how Russia has been exploiting Ukraine’s main vulnerabilities: insufficient manpower, artillery shortages, sparse air defenses and inadequate defensive fortifications. Ukraine’s frontline brigades are clinging on as they desperately await munitions from allies and fresh recruits to provide some much-needed manpower. CNN has laid out the three key frontiers where fighting is now raging, tracking the marginal gains Russia has made along a frontline which had previously been frozen for months. In the north, Moscow’s troops are aiming to bring its troops within tube artillery range of Kharkiv city. Along the southern front, the battle is on to recapture villages liberated during Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year and push further into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, meanwhile, is racing to fix its current weak spots after finding itself on the back foot as it pledges to fight “house by house, street by street.” The Kharkiv front The cross-border assault saw the Russians quickly take control of several villages. Since then, Russia has ramped up its attacks in the area as it tries to take control of the key settlements of Vovchansk and Lypsti. Lyptsi, which lies around 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv, is under heavy Russian bombardment. Capturing the large village would allow Russian troops to position artillery within range of Kharkiv city, Ukraine’s second largest, which is already vulnerable to missile attacks, as this weekend’s strike on a hardware store showed. The attack also allows Russia to divert already thinly stretched Ukrainian resources away from other front lines, and to create a buffer zone from Ukrainian attacks on Russian border regions. The nearby Russian city of Belgorod, for instance, has increasingly come under Ukrainian attack in recent months. The east - Avdiivka and Bakhmut Before the Kharkiv offensive, Russia had been largely focusing its offensive capabilities in the east, where it had been inching forward since October 2023 as Ukraine’s highly-anticipated counteroffensive floundered last summer. Capturing Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland – known as the Donbas - remains a major Kremlin goal. In February, Moscow’s troops notched up a major success along this front when they took the town of Avdiivka. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the decision to pull back was made to “save our soldiers’ lives” and came in the face of constant, heavy Russian bombardment and a ten-to-one shell disadvantage. Since then, Russian troops have made steady progress westwards in the direction of Pokrovsk, which serves as a vital military hub in Ukraine’s war effort. A few dozen kilometers to the north, eastern city of Bakhmut was recaptured by the Russians in spring last year following a grinding, nine-month battle. Now, Russia’s forces are edging west towards Chasiv Yar. Getting control of high ground on which the town sits would put Putin’s troops closer to the strategic city of Kramatorsk. The battle for Robotyne Further to the south, Ukrainian forces are coming under pressure southeast of Zaporizhzhia, one of the few areas where they achieved success, albeit modest in size, in last summer’s counteroffensive. Both Russian military bloggers and Ukraine’s DeepStateMap report small Russian advances into a pocket of recaptured Ukrainian territory. Robotyne, a tiny village that is now completely destroyed, has changed hands several times during the war. It was first captured by Russian forces in early March 2022 and Moscow again claimed control over it earlier this month, something denied by Ukraine. The battle for Robotyne highlights the fluidity of the battlefield and is a stark illustration of the nature of the fighting, with the war being decided in brutal battles for often abandoned villages.

CNN — There seems to be a doctrine within the National Security Council in the Biden administration: escalation aversion. These “escalationists” seem deeply worried that any increase in support for Ukraine could lead to World War III . France and Germany on Tuesday took the important step of joining the UK and other countries in saying the weapons they supply Ukraine could be used in strikes on Russian soil. Predictably, Russian President Vladmir Putin responded that these moves could lead to “serious consequences,” particularly for “small and densely populated countries.” This threat has been made by Putin again and again , often referencing Russia’s nuclear weapons, as the West has upped it’s support for Ukraine. The US needs to stop taking it seriously. Let’s revisit some history from the last couple of years.

No nuclear war occurred. After the battle of Kyiv was won, Ukraine requested MiG-29s , which Poland agreed to provide in exchange for Western fighters . The Biden administration blocked this initially, but later relented, and no nuclear war occurred. Ukraine requested F-16 fighter jets to help protect its skies.

In almost every one of these cases, Russia threatened escalation, an attack on NATO or the use of nuclear weapons. Each time, the bluff was called, and Ukraine was able to better defend its territory. Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges In almost every one of these cases, Russia threatened escalation, an attack on NATO or the use of nuclear weapons. Each time, the bluff was called, and Ukraine was able to better defend its territory. While Russian threats should not be taken lightly, history shows us that these threats are often hollow. During the Cold War , nuclear threats were not uncommon, but the US didn’t keep them from advancing its foreign policy interests. Imagine if we had provided Ukraine with all of the above weapons from the start? After the 2022 counteroffensive, Russia was on the defensive, disorganized and demoralized and struggling to recruit more troops. Ukraine might have finished the fight using all of the above, or at least had a much more successful counteroffensive in 2023. The war might have ended. There are those who say that the Biden administration’s careful calibration has allowed the US to give increasing amounts of firepower to Ukraine without triggering Russian tripwires. But this isn’t how war works. The idea that Russia would use nukes has been shown not to be a real concern. Just as we slowly rachet up pressure, so could Russia slowly increase its pain tolerance and have chosen to react at any point. All of this is important to remember as Ukraine repeatedly requests permission to strike military targets inside Russia with American weapons . So far, they have been denied, but let’s make a prediction: They will eventually be granted this permission. So why wait? Why delay while Ukrainians continue to lose their lives? Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. Annegret Hilse/Reuters We understood the prohibition on attacks on Russian soil when Ukraine was struggling to defend Kyiv. It didn’t make sense to waste efforts on “revenge strikes” when fighting to clear territory. However, once the war entered the attrition phase after Russian left Kyiv and the fighting became an artillery duel between the two wise in eastern Ukraine, it became utter nonsense to keep this prohibition alive. Right now, Ukrainians have been forced to endure Russian air attacks from glide bombs . Despite knowing the origin point of these attacks, they have been unable to attack those sites. Of course, escalation management is important, and support for Ukraine, or any ally, should not come with blinders. The US, in providing lethal aid, deserves a seat at the table and input on how the aid should be used. However, when faced with an existential crisis, much latitude should be given to Ukraine to determine how best to defend its land and save lives. We have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again. In logical warfare, it is precisely at the moment of retreat and regroup that you would double down and strike harder, creating chaos, panic and crushing fighting strength and morale. Ukraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call “time out” in their own territory. Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook Ukraine fights primarily for its survival, but they also fight for the collective West and the post-World War II order. With such serious implications on the world stage, the Biden administration needs to articulate, or at least have a clear internal understanding of, what the US aims to achieve through its support. A clear strategic objective, which the US failed to establish in Vietnam and Afghanistan , can lead to victory. But does the US support a Ukrainian victory? If so, what does that look like, and what needs to happen to achieve these ends as quickly as possible? Or is it simply supporting a war of attrition until Russia comes to the table? As any military expert or general (or sergeant, for that matter) will tell you, destroying the enemy is, of course, the most important element of victory, whether in direct combat or where they are grouping, planning or executing the war. The idea that, as of today, Russia can essentially consider its own territory a “safe haven” against US weaponry runs counter to the objective of a Ukrainian victory. Ukraine has been prevented from attacking legitimate military targets because of a paralyzing fear of escalation, despite the law of armed conflict giving Ukraine the right to defend itself in such a way. The Biden administration deserves credit for its actions in Ukraine , especially given the alternative of former President Donald Trump’s threat to abandon the country . However, the fear of escalation, while noble, is actually making a victory for Ukraine less likely."

Men are often the victims,"Electrocuted with a Soviet-era phone, forced to strip and threatened with rape.

Kyiv CNN — Within an hour of being arrested by Russian security forces, Roman Shapovalenko was threatened with rape. On August 25, 2022, the day after Ukraine’s Independence Day, he said three armed, masked officers from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed his home in the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson , which was occupied by Russian forces at the time. They turned his house inside out searching for incriminating evidence. A message in Shapovalenko’s phone that called Russian soldiers “orcs” — a derisive reference to the evil forces in J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth books and a popular Ukrainian slur for the Russian army — was enough for them. He said he was tied up, blindfolded and stuffed into an unmarked car. For days after, Shapovalenko said he was repeatedly electrocuted in his genital area, threatened with being raped with a glass bottle, and was even made to believe he could be sterilized. “They seemed to have a fetish for genitalia. Sometimes the door would open, and they would say: ‘We’re going to take out our batons and we’re going to rape everyone here,’” the 39-year-old farm manager told CNN. Describing the graphic detail of his experience matter-of-factly, Shapovalenko sometimes paused to laugh nervously. He said his sense of humor is helping with what he knows will be a long recovery. The Russians, he said, hated it. “I made a little joke, and they didn’t like it. I got punched for that.” Shapovalenko’s experience of sexual violence at the hands of Russian forces is common among Ukrainians – including civilians and soldiers – who have been detained since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country more than two years ago. Human rights monitors have long reported on the rampant use of sexual violence by Russian police and security forces against prisoners and detainees in Russia. Now it seems Russia is exporting the practice to occupied Ukraine.

Chris McGrath/Getty Images Few men have spoken publicly about their ordeal, but Ukrainian prosecutors and rights groups say male victims make up a growing proportion of cases. The crimes often go unreported because of the stigma and shame associated with them. The latest United Nations Security Council annual report into conflict-related sexual violence said that 85 cases had been documented in Ukraine in 2023 – affecting 52 men, 31 women, one girl and one boy. A separate report from UN rights officials who interviewed 60 male Ukrainian prisoners of war following their release found that 39 were victims of sexual violence while in Russian detention. CNN interviewed four male survivors, two in person and two by phone, and obtained testimonies from two more, who were held by Russian units across five Ukrainian regions that have been occupied or annexed by Moscow: Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Crimea. All described being subjected to forced nudity, genital electrocution – most often with wires from the Soviet-era military field telephone TA-57, known as “Tapik” – and threats of rape. Their accounts tallied with cases documented by regional prosecutors in Kyiv, Kherson and Kharkiv and were corroborated by witnesses held in the same detention facilities in Kharkiv and Kherson.

Ukraine says they’re being held as bargaining chips Taken together, their stories capture what prosecutors describe as Russia’s systematic and continuing use of sexual violence in occupied areas as part of its efforts to force the Ukrainian people into submission. “We see it over and over again in different regions under occupation. They use the same method of committing sexual violence, the same method of humiliation, the same method of how they explain it to their victims,” said Anna Sosonska, a Ukrainian prosecutor and the acting chief of the conflict-related sexual violence division in Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General. Speaking to CNN from her office in Kyiv, Sosonska said that a significant number of documented crimes of sexual violence by Russian troops, including forced nudity, genital mutilation, rape and forced exposure to sexual violence against others, were being carried out against men. “Especially by using electric current on genitals – that is the top of the list,” she said. ‘They all laughed’ Roman Chernenko said he spent seven months in a “punishment cell” in a prison in the occupied city of Olenivka, in the eastern Donetsk region, after he was captured by Russian troops in Mariupol area. The 29-year-old intelligence officer with the Ukrainian military – who goes by the call sign “Omen” – described being tortured as often as three times a day, every day, for four months. “Tapik is a military phone with two wires. One is connected to your balls, the other to your finger, and they just keep turning the current up,” he told CNN. “They just keep twisting it until the person tells them what they need.” He said he believes officers from Russia’s GRU, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and the FSB, Russia’s main intelligence agency, all took part in the torture. Chernenko was released as part of a prisoner exchange in January 2024 and is still recovering from the ordeal. Speaking to CNN a few weeks after his release, on the day he proposed to his girlfriend, he said it was his thoughts of her and his mother that gave him strength to survive captivity. “They laughed when they tortured me … they told me that my mother was being f**ked by Chechens. They took me to be shot twice, they threatened me with rape,” he said. CNN asked Russia’s Ministry of Defense, Interior Ministry, FSB, National Guard (Rosgvardia) and the military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, for comment on allegations of sexual violence at specific detention facilities, but has not received any response.

Ukrainian police said the bodies of five men aged between 24 and 54 were found there. Kyodo News/Getty Images Rape and sexual violence are explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions – the set of international laws that regulate the conduct of armed conflict – and can constitute a war crime. Mock execution is considered a form of torture under international law. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), committing rape and sexual violence in a systematic or widespread way is considered a crime against humanity. According to Ukrainian prosecutors investigating conflict-based sexual violence and abuse, all available evidence indicates that it is a deliberate tactic, part of Russia’s modus operandi in Ukraine. “It’s in every region that was under occupation. Everywhere that Russian troops were located, we’re seeing cases of sexual violence and gender-based violence. The bottom line is that it looks like it is Russian policy,” Sosonska said. As of early May, Ukraine has officially recorded 293 cases of sexual violence, although Sosonska said that it is impossible to estimate the real number of crimes that are being committed, particularly in occupied territories which remain inaccessible to its investigators and prosecutors.

Sergei Chuzavkov/SOPA Images/Sipa USA/Reuters Related article World must learn from Bosnian war in dealing with sexual violence in Ukraine conflict, report says Some 37,000 Ukrainian citizens are unaccounted for, according to the Ukrainian ombudsman’s office, with thousands believed to be held in Russian detention and at risk of torture and sexual violence. But the real scale of sexual violence committed during the war may never come to light. Only a fraction of victims tend to come forward and, according to the UN, this is especially true for men, some of whom may not initially realize that what happened to them was a sexual violence crime. Some male victims of sexual violence may describe what happened to them instead as “torture.” The distinction, Sosonska explained, is important for any future court cases and war tribunals. Her office is also trying to educate the public about the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence – something Sosonska said may still not be fully understood. Anna Mykytenko, who heads the Ukraine team at Global Rights Compliance (GRC), an international legal non-profit, said that Ukrainian witnesses and survivors of sexual violence have testified that Russian troops told them it was a “punishment.” “In several villages in the south we heard witnesses and survivors say that the Russian servicemen came in, occupied the village, and then looked specifically for the wives of Ukrainian soldiers, or their mothers or sisters,” Mykytenko told CNN. GRC acts as the co-lead of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, an initiative launched by the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to provide Ukraine with assistance in the investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes. Mykytenko said that while most cases of conflict-related sexual crimes that were reported and investigated earlier in the war concerned female victims, many of the cases recently recorded have been against male victims, especially against men held in captivity. “Sexual crimes are fairly common in detention centers and it’s very common for prisoners of war or civilians to be threatened with rape or with the sexual abuse of different types, this is something that’s almost normal for the Russian and Russia-related armed forces,” she said. ‘A systematic approach’ The Ukrainian ombudsman’s office told CNN it believes that the Russian armed forces and Ministry of Defense, as well as the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, are the Russian government bodies officially responsible for what happens inside detention facilities. However, it is Rosgvardia – a paramilitary police force deployed to keep order in occupied regions of Ukraine – and the FSB that appear to be driving the campaign of torture and sexual violence against the Ukrainian people, according to the ombudsman and Ukraine’s military intelligence service. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the FSB has opened several regional offices in occupied Ukraine to recruit agents and gather intelligence. According to an official organizational chart published on its website, the FSB has directorates in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, in Crimea and in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Several survivors in these locations told CNN that the Russians who submitted them to sexual violence either identified themselves or were referred to by others as FSB officers. Meanwhile, members of Rosgvardia, part of the Russian security apparatus that reports directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin, are working alongside the Russian military to detain activists, quash protests and spread terror among the civilian population in occupied areas. The SBU, Ukraine’s security service, has managed to track down several Rosgvardia and FSB officials who it said were either the direct perpetrators or the enablers of sexual violence against people held in detention. A Rosgvardia serviceman watches a parade in Russia. The force, which reports directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been deployed to occupied Ukraine to quash protests and opposition. Aleksey Smagin/Sipa USA/AP The SBU and the Ukrainian regional prosecutor’s office in Kherson have identified Aleksandr Naumenko, the deputy head of Rosgvardia in Russia’s Rostov region, as a suspect in more than a dozen cases. Ukrainian authorities said last May he was responsible for overseeing a detention facility in Kherson during the occupation and that he personally ordered sexual torture of several victims who were electrocuted in their genital areas. The notice of suspicion against Naumenko, a legal document seen by CNN, alleges that his subordinates and other members of Russian armed forces acted directly on his orders when they sexually abused at least 17 victims. Two other Rosgvardia officers – Oleksandr Chilengirov and Yehor Bondarenkov – have also been accused of torture, including electrocuting at least 24 victims in their genitals at a different detention facility in Kherson. Dmitry Laikov, an officer with the FSB’s Department for the Defense of Constitutional Order and Fight against Terrorism, is accused of overseeing genital electrocution of a detained Ukrainian citizen in a police station in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. All four men have been indicted and their cases are currently being heard in court, according to Kherson prosecutors. Their whereabouts are unknown.

UN Security Council Meeting, New York, USA - 16 Apr 2018
UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed on Monday stressed the need to stop sexual violence in conflict. Xinhua/Shutterstock Related article Russia using rape as ‘military strategy’ in Ukraine: UN envoy Ukrainian officials say that it is difficult, but not impossible, to track down individual perpetrators of sexual violence crimes. As of early May, Ukrainian prosecutors had issued official notices of suspicion against 42 Russian officers, filed 19 indictments against 28 individuals and sentenced five people. All of the trials took place in absentia, according to the prosecutors’ office. Sosonska told CNN a handful of cases are added to her file each month, and that investigations are progressing. However, none of the alleged perpetrators are in Ukrainian custody. Oleksii Butenko, a prosecutor in the Kherson regional prosecutor’s office, said he has no doubt that sexual violence was part of Russia’s strategy to subjugate the Ukrainian people in Kherson and to “destroy the Ukrainian national identity.” “We can speak of a systematic approach – 17 men were identified as having been sexually abused inside a single torture chamber,” he told CNN. “We can say that the leadership, not only the perpetrators but also the management, is responsible – they gave permission or orders to commit these crimes.” ‘They were having fun’ Andrii, a Kherson resident who was held in one of the Russian detention facilities, still remembers the screams of his fellow detainees more than a year and half after he was released. “We were kept in the basement of an office building. It was a small room with no furniture, we slept on cardboard and used a bucket to go to the toilet,” Andrii said. Speaking to CNN in Kyiv, Andrii was clutching his hands nervously, looking away when describing what happened during his time in detention. He asked for his name to be changed and that no identifiable information about him be published. “I was the last one to be taken in for interrogation, so I could hear them all being tortured in the next room. I couldn’t hear the conversations, only the screams and the moans. It was impossible to sleep because of these screams,” he said, recalling one particularly horrifying incident. “I don’t know who this man was and what happened to him … he was taken out into the corridor, where he was raped with a baton so that everyone could hear and see him.” A war crime prosecutor inspects a basement of an office building in Kherson where some 30 people were held for two months during the Russian occupation. Anna Voitenko/Reuters According to Andrii, the threats of rape and genital electrocution were the norm among the Russian forces. “They enjoyed it. They were having fun,” he said. Ukrainian prosecutors have recorded incidents of Russian officials raping or attempting to rape victims using objects including batons, a pipe, a bottle, a handle of a shovel, a stick and a pen. Sosonska said her office is determined to bring to justice not just the direct perpetrators, but also those who were in charge – whether they ordered them or failed to prevent them. Her office is focused on prosecuting individuals, but it is also collecting evidence that will be shared with international courts, including the ICC, which prosecutes individuals over grave offenses such as genocide and war crimes, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which hears cases brought up against states. The ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russia’s children’s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova , over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. The Kremlin has denied the allegations and called the ICC’s actions “outrageous.” Sosonska said she believes that, just like the child deportations, sexual violence is part of what she called “Russia’s genocidal campaign” against Ukraine. ‘It is happening now’ Oleksii Sivak knew the Russians were coming for him after his neighbor Shapovalenko, the farm manager, was taken. The 39-year-old sailor from Kherson had helped him put up Ukrainian flags around their neighborhood on Ukrainian Independence Day. Both men were civilian volunteers. Shapovalenko had been distributing supplies, helping people evacuate and sharing information about the location of Russian troops with Ukrainian military acquaintances, while Sivak ran a soup kitchen, organizing assistance, distributing leaflets and putting up posters and flags. “We already knew about these torture rooms; we knew that people do not return from there. I went to deliver soup, warned the people I was helping, cut off all contacts and came home to wait for them,” he said. Hiding or trying to go on the run was not an option, he added, saying he was aware Russian forces were targeting the relatives of people they were interested in. He said eight men came to arrest him – four in military uniforms and four wearing civilian clothes, all with their faces covered. They took him to a local police station and then handed him over to what they said was the FSB. He recalled being beaten and tortured with an electric current from the same kind of field telephone described as being used in other detention facilities. “They called it ‘the lie detector’ and they were obviously having fun when spinning the dynamo, asking me ‘do you want to call Zelensky?’” he told CNN in an interview in Kyiv. “First, they put the clamps on my ears and while they were shocking me, they were also beating me with a stick, kicking me, and hitting me with their hands … then they moved these wires from my ears to my genitals. They said, ‘we’re going to sterilize you now’ and things like that, while they were electrocuting my genitals.” Sivak believes he has a pretty good idea why the Russian troops chose to torture him in the way they did and threatened him with rape. Mass burial site in Izyum, Ukraine. (Office of the President of Ukraine) Office of the President of Ukraine Related article Some bodies found at mass burial site in Izium show ‘signs of torture,’ Ukraine says “They wanted to humiliate me. It’s obvious. What do you do to cause a man the most pain? You hurt his wife or his genitals,” he said. Of the dozens of men he was held with, Sivak said roughly half were subjected to sexual violence. “It’s a whole system. Four people (tortured me) but they were just the hatchet men. Yes, they have no brains, yes, they are animals, but even if they are imprisoned, what about their bosses? Someone was managing them; someone was giving them orders.” Sivak said he and several other survivors have formed an informal support group and are trying to raise awareness of the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence. Sivak has attended meetings with government officials and conferences where he shared his experiences. Ukraine is prepared for a lengthy process to bring perpetrators to justice – while protecting the victims. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Sosonska’s prosecutors, as well as other civil servants and local government officials, have received specialized training on victim-oriented approaches, learning how to recognize conflict-related sexual violence, run investigations and communicate with victims. Some of the training programs have been provided by the UN in a direct response to the large number of sexual crimes occurring during the occupation. Others are run in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations and victim support groups. The UN has also co-sponsored a psychological helpline specifically aimed at male survivors.

Some survivors of sexual violence committed by the Bosnian Serb army during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s are only now coming forward. “Some survivors might be willing to testify within a few months, for some, it may never happen, they may never be ready,” Sosonska said. As for Shapovalenko, he said he wanted everyone to know what happened to him – and what is still happening to others. “I want to tell everyone, tell the international community, that it is not like they came, occupied us, stood there with machine guns and left. No, it wasn’t like that,” he said. “And the most terrible thing is not what I am telling you now. The most terrible thing is that it is happening now in the occupied territories.” CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova and Victoria Butenko contributed reporting."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/28/europe/ukraine-french-weapons-russia-macron-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,France and Germany say Ukraine should be able to use their weapons to strike inside Russia,France and Germany said Tuesday that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine.,"May 29, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Brad Lendon,Ukraine,"CNN — France and Germany said Tuesday that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. “Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,” Macron said during his visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. “So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we’re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we’re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?” “We think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,” Macron continued. Macron added, however, that “we must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia,” including civilian or other military targets. Germany’s Scholz echoed Macron’s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law. “Ukraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,” Scholz said. “I find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.” Western allies of Ukraine have long held the policy that donated weapons should be strictly limited to usage inside Ukrainian territory. The issue is a controversial one, with fears from Western leaders that if their weaponry is used to strike inside Russia, it would escalate the violence and trigger a wider war involving NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked permission from his allies to expand the usage of the provided weapons to strike inside Russia. The United States, the largest arms supplier to Ukraine, has previously forbidden Kyiv from firing its weapons inside Russian territory over escalation concerns. However, in comments that appeared to hint at the possibility of a change in policy, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the US would continue to “adapt and adjust” its support for Ukraine. “Another hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed. Battlefields change. As what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we’ve adapted and adjusted too. And I am confident we will continue to do that,” he said when asked about the possibility of allowing Ukraine to strike Russian soil. But Blinken also reiterated that at present the US has not enabled Ukraine to strike beyond its borders into Russia with US weaponry. “We haven’t encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine. Ukraine, as I’ve said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself. We’re going to make sure that it has the equipment that it needs to do that,” Blinken said. When pressed on his remarks about adjusting and adapting, he added, “We’re always listening. We’re always learning, and we’re always making determinations about what’s necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself.” Shift in red lines? Previous red lines drawn by Western leaders in their support for Ukraine have been crossed, including the provision of tanks, which was agreed in early 2023 to help Ukraine breach enemy defensive lines, and F-16 fighter jets, which European governments agreed to in the summer of 2023 after months of diplomatic pressure. France has supplied Ukraine with an unknown number of SCALP cruise missiles, according to the French Defense Ministry’s website. The SCALP missiles have a range of up to 155 kilometers (96 miles) and carry a 400-kilogram (881-pound) high-explosive penetration warhead, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images/File The SCALP is the equivalent of Britain’s Storm Shadow , which has also been given to Ukraine, and which British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said earlier this month could be used at Kyiv’s discretion. “In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons, they are defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,” Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv. “We don’t discuss any caveats that we put on those things. But let’s be absolutely clear: Russia has launched an attack into Ukraine, and Ukraine absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia.” France has also supplied Ukraine with a range of military weaponry, including Caesar self-propelled howitzers with a range of up to 42 kilometers. Macron stressed that the French arms are to be used only against targets from which attacks are launched into Ukraine. “We must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia,” including civilian or other military targets, the French leader said.

The deal was part of a bilateral security agreement signed between the two countries Tuesday in Brussels, according to the Ukrainian leader.

The first F-16 jets from Belgium will be delivered this year. “The agreement guarantees Belgium’s timely security assistance, modern armored vehicles, equipment to meet Ukraine’s air force and air defense needs, naval security, mine clearance, participation in the artillery ammunition coalition, and military training,” Zelensky said. The meeting follows a similar agreement between Ukraine and Spain on Monday, with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announcing a $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/ukraine-war-us-tanks-intl/index.html,Soldiers in Ukraine say US-supplied tanks have made them targets for Russian strikes,The Ukrainian request for complex and heavy Abrams tanks sparked significant debate in early 2023.,"May 29, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Nick Paton Walsh,Ukraine,"Eastern Ukraine CNN — Ukrainian crews working on US-supplied Abrams tanks have told CNN of a series of the weaknesses and flaws with the armored vehicles, calling into doubt their utility on the war’s ever-changing frontlines. The donation was announced by US President Joe Biden as evidence of the United States’ “enduring and unflagging commitment to Ukraine.” CNN journalists were the first reporters to see the M1 Abrams in Ukraine, at a location in the country’s east, where around six vehicles were visible, hiding in the foliage. Crews trained in Germany said the vehicles – the US military’s main $10 million battle tank used in Iraq against Saddam Hussein’s forces and insurgents – lacked armor that could stop modern weapons. “Its armor is not sufficient for this moment,” said one crew member, callsign Joker. “It doesn’t protect the crew. For real, today this is the war of drones. So now, when the tank rolls out, they always try to hit them.” His colleague, Dnipro, added they are the “number one target.” “Without defense, the crew doesn’t survive at the battlefield,” he said. CNN Related article ‘How do I live?’ A 10-year-old Ukrainian orphan recalls the brutal destruction of his family The crew showed CNN their attempts to affix active armor to one damaged tank. They used plates of plastic explosive that, when hit by a round, detonate and provide a protective counter-blast. All 31 Abrams deployed to Ukraine are engaged near the frontline in the east, according to officials in the 47th Mechanised Brigade, who took receipt of them all. The Ukrainian request for Abrams, complex and heavy tanks, sparked significant debate in early 2023, as the American vehicle has a complex supply chain. Some versions even run on jet fuel. Pentagon officials said in April that the Abrams were pulled back from the frontline due to the threat of Russian attack drones, although the 47th said some were still in action, despite the deficiencies that had materialized. Much of the Ukrainian frontline is now dominated by the use of self-destructing attack drones, tiny and accurate devices that can swarm infantry and even cause significant damage to tanks. The advent of these so called First-Person Vision (FPV) drones, flown by soldiers wearing gaming goggles, has changed the nature of the war, limiting movement and introducing a new element of vulnerability to armored vehicles. This Ukrainian crew have learned of the Abrams’ limitations the hard way, in pitched battles around the town of Avdiivka, which Russia finally took control of in February. A driver lost a leg when the armor was penetrated. Yet it is not just innovation that is hamstringing the tanks — they appear to have technical issues too. One, parked under a tree, was almost immobile during CNN’s visit, due to an engine problem, the crew say, despite the vehicle having just been shipped in from Poland. They also complain of how, in rain or fog, condensation can fry the electronics inside the vehicle. CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment. Ukrainian troops repair an American-supplied Abrams tank. Mick Krever/CNN Ammunition is also a problem, like elsewhere on the Ukrainian frontline. They say they seem to have the wrong type for the fight they are in. “What we have is more for direct tank-to-tank fights, which happens very rarely,” Joker said. “Much more often we work as artillery. You need to take apart a tree-line or a building. We had a case when we fired 17 rounds into a house and it was still standing.” The tank’s poor performance has been mocked by Russian analysts, dubbing them “empty tin cans.” One model was captured by Russian forces and, damaged, paraded in Red Square. NATO “would never” use the Abrams tank the way the Ukrainian military has to use it, a Ukrainian soldier who uses the moniker “Joker” said. Mick Krever/CNN The Ukrainian crew expressed frustration the tanks were made for a NATO style of warfare, in which air power and artillery prepare the battlefield before tanks and infantry advance. Kyiv has long bemoaned its lack of artillery and air power. “They would never do it,” Joker said, of NATO soldiers undertaking the same advances they make without air support. He switched to English to mimic a NATO soldier: “‘Call the aviation, call the artillery,’” he said. “We have no aviation and artillery. We have only tank. And it’s the problem.” A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defense ministry told CNN that “Ukraine is now testing and improving equipment that was not initially prepared for our war.” “We are asking all countries to support us with equipment of any technical capacity levels. We use all of it accordingly,” the spokesperson added. Biden’s decision to supply the Abrams came after European allies pledged to send their own battle tanks in early 2023 ahead of Ukraine’s failed summer counteroffensive last year, a step that had been deemed unthinkable months earlier. Kyiv’s allies have slowly swallowed the red lines of what equipment they once refused to supply. F-16s may arrive in Ukraine in the months ahead. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s military commander, on Monday said he had signed initial paperwork to permit France to send military trainers into the country to try and reverse an urgent manpower problem on the frontlines. France’s defense ministry declined to confirm the plan, but said it, and other ideas, had long been under discussion. The move would mark a significant escalation in the West’s involvement in the war, now in its third year. The Ukrainian defense ministry later appeared to tamp down those expectations, saying in a statement to CNN that it had “started internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken.” For the Abrams crew, each delay in equipment or assistance costs the lives of friends. “I only have one question,” Joker said of US assistance. “Why is this taking so long and (comes) partially? We are losing time. It’s death to us.” Victoria Butenko contributed to this report."

Five people remain missing, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said Monday. He said that 48 people were injured in the strike that hit the Epicenter hypermarket shopping center building while nearly 200 people were inside. Kharkiv , Ukraine’s second biggest city, which sits near its border with Russia, has seen a spate of Russian attacks in recent weeks. Security camera footage of the moment of the strike shows the building shake on impact, with the whole site immediately engulfed in thick smoke and flames. Police and witnesses described at least two explosions taking place. Oleksandr Lutsenko, director of the Epicenter shopping center, said he was in his office on the second floor at the time of the two explosions. “I started to make my way down the corridor to the evacuation exit, but it was dark and the whole corridor was covered in dust. There was no air to breathe,” he told CNN over the telephone. “The employees were also leaving. Everyone was groping, and people were holding each other. We could hear the ceiling falling.” Once outside, he saw the hypermarket was on fire. “There was black smoke everywhere, and it was hard to breathe. Some people were jumping out of the windows,” Lutsenko added. Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said the hours following the strike were “hellish” and thanked everyone who helped to put out the fires. Photographs from inside the store following the attack show the building in complete ruin, with burnt stock and collapsed walls.

Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images Ukrainian Catholic University identified the killed 12-year-old as Maria Myronenko, saying in a Facebook post that she had died in the strike alongside her mother, Iryna, who was a student at the institute. Her father had also been injured and was being treated in hospital, it said. Serhii Bolvinov, Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police, said the family had been shopping when the two bombs hit. Maria’s elder sister, Nadiya, 20, was not with them at the time, and learned of the deaths only after finding her father in hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike as a “brutal attack,” saying that “Russia is run by men who want to make it a norm – burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.” Zelensky, who was in Spain for an official visit on Monday, urged Ukraine’s allies to provide it with more air defenses. Meeting with Zelensky in Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced on Monday a new $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine that “aims to reinforce air defense systems” and protect Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure from Russia’s attacks. “We are sending Patriot missiles,” Sanchez said of the American-built air-defense system. “Zelensky asks for the platforms to launch those, asking how many we can give. We are sending another batch of Leopard tanks and above all, munitions that the [Ukrainian] troops need.” CNN Related article ‘How do I live?’ A 10-year-old Ukrainian orphan recalls the brutal destruction of his family Zelensky was due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed the trip due to Russia’s offensive around Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine. That offensive appears to continue, with Kharkiv enduring intense attacks daily. The United States announced on Friday that it’s sending $275 million in military assistance to Ukraine as part of “efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia’s assault near Kharkiv,” according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The top US diplomat said the new tranche of assistance “contains urgently needed capabilities” for Ukrainian troops as they fight to hold back Russia’s advances toward the key northeastern city. Ukraine tamps down French trainer comments News of the new military assistance came as Ukraine’s Defense Ministry tamped down expectations that French military trainers could soon be in Ukraine after online comments from army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi appeared to suggest their arrival in country was a done deal. “I welcome the initiative of France to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian military personnel,” Syrskyi had written on Telegram following a video conference between himself and the two countries’ defense ministers. “I have already signed the documents that will allow the first French instructors to visit our training centres and get acquainted with the infrastructure and personnel.” Syrskyi’s statement gave no possible timeline, but seemed to indicate France was ready to make what would be a very significant shift in NATO countries’ involvement in Ukraine’s war with Russia. Further heightening that sense, Syrskyi went on to write, “I believe that France’s determination will encourage other partners to join this ambitious project. I thanked the minister for the friendly support of the French people and military and economic assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian military aggression.” Latvian President Edgar Rinkēvičs tells Christiane Amanpour that the situation in Ukraine is critical and agrees that NATO allies should lift some restrictions on Ukraine's use of donated weapons. Clipped From Video video Related video ‘A consequence of our inability to provide Ukraine with weapons"": Latvian President In a later comment to CNN, apparently designed to lower expectations, and possibly soothe key allies, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry toned down the language, saying Kyiv had “expressed interest in the prospect of welcoming foreign instructors in Ukraine” ever since a conference in Paris at the end of February. “We have ongoing discussions with France and other countries on this issue and have started internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken,” the short statement concluded. The French Defense Ministry, in a comment to CNN, had a similar message about military trainers. “As with all the projects discussed at the conference, we are continuing to work with the Ukrainians to understand their exact needs,” the statement said. At the Paris conference, French President Emmanuel Macron had floated the idea that sending military trainers to Ukraine was one way Kyiv’s western allies could deploy troops in the country.

An explosion.,"May 27, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Nick Paton Walsh,Ukraine,"Eastern Ukraine CNN — Mykola first thought it was a dream. The windows of his home blown out. The whistle of a shell landing . An explosion. But as the 10-year-old younger son of Larisa and Mykola Glushko staggered in the dark, toward his mother’s room, he realized he was awake, and that his mother lay before him, crushed beneath a collapsed concrete baton. “Something fell,” he recalled. “Mom was saying, ‘Kolya, Kolya.’ I shouted, ‘Mom, I’m alive.’” He said he frantically scraped the dust from his face and eyes. “I saw my Mom crushed down by the ceiling. I tried to pull it away, but I couldn’t. Mom was moaning and shaking her legs. And I was shouting, ‘Mother, mother, it’s just a dream, a horrible dream.’” Mykola had a similar nightmare days earlier, and felt it might be recurring. “Then there was darkness.” His mother died in front of him. His father was killed by the initial explosion. Hours earlier, the family had a barbecue, and Mykola senior drank one beer too many and talked passionately about enlisting. In the pitch black, his son clambered outside, the front of their comfortable family home beyond recognition, its gates torn clean away. The shelled-out home of the Glushko family in Pokrovsk. Mick Krever/CNN Mykola said: “I was screaming, ‘God, why did you do this to me?’ I was running in underwear asking for help.” For Mykola, the act of survival stretches what any 10-year-old could be expected to bear. His loss, part of a patina of suffering across Ukraine’s two years of war , where Russian missiles that slammed inexplicably into civilian targets, claim lives that do not make the headlines, and unravel childhoods in ways that will echo for decades in Ukraine. Mykola was given a shot of medicine to calm him in hospital, and his brother came to explain what had happened. “He told me now it’s only me and him left. He repeated it four times. I was trying to calm myself down, but also hated myself. Because I couldn’t save my mom.” The graves of Larisa and Mykola Glushko in Pokrovsk. Mick Krever/CNN He has spoken with his new guardian, his godmother, who lives nearby, and is clear he will stay in the military town of Pokrovsk to tend their graves. “I will visit them,” he said. “(I will) apologize for not able to save them. Will apologize to my father that I couldn’t save my mom, his wife.” He said his dream now is different, to ask his parents important questions. “What should I do now? How do I live? Another dream is to take revenge on the one who launched the missile.” Across the eastern frontline, notably around Pokrovsk, the pace of Russia’s advance appears to quicken, and with it the unspeakable loss of families like Mykola’s. At the ruins of his home, neighbors said there is no military target nearby. Workers sifted through the dust. The smell of the decaying family dog lingered. On a nearby radio, Russians are so close their stations were audible, explaining to their audience how the West refuses to give Ukraine modern equipment and so “the ordinary boys from Ukrainian armed forces will be the ones to suck it up.” A short drive away, at a stabilization point in an eastern town, the life-changing hideousness of even light injuries wasapparent. Sunset means frontline units can begin the task of evacuating their wounded, safe from the Russian attack drones that haunt daylight hours. The medical point waited in complete darkness, and a car raced out from the night. Two wounded soldiers from Klishchiivka – a town where Moscow has recently claimed success, partially owing to Ukraine having to relocate forces from there to defend against the onslaught in Kharkiv region – emerged from the car. One has his head fully bandaged up and talked, his arms outstretched, as groped his way forward. The other was laid flat on a gurney. Video Ad Feedback CNN witnesses Ukrainian soldiers being treated after blast hits dugout 02:04 - Source: CNN They were quickly tended to. Clothes were gently cut away. One had damage to his eyes, swollen shut, yet appearedotherwise less badly hurt. The other had shrapnel in his leg, flesh injuries to his arm, and was peppered with shrapnel on his back. His face was covered with dirt and his eyes also struggled to open. A mortar landed about four feet (1.2 meters) from their dugout. It is a matter of luck and a few feet that they are still physically intact. The staff swiftly tried to clean their eyes. “When I open the eye like this, do you see the light?” a doctor asked. “What about people?” The patient could only see light. A nurse noticed damage to his right hand. They examined his back and saw a morass of tiny wounds. Suddenly, the patient worsened. “Something on my side,” he screamed. It is possible the force of the blast caused internal injuries. The doctors moved to quickly intervene. Anaesthetic was injected into his lung, and a tube inserted. “Cough, and it will get better,” a doctor told the patient. Around the pair, there were four empty beds. A year ago, one doctor, Ivan, told us, they could have 250 patients a day, when the Russian assault on Bakhmut was at its peak. Yet the drop in patients does not herald an improvement in Ukraine’s war. The 93rd mechanized brigade lacks infantry, and finds it hard to resupply and position them on the frontline because of the threat of Russian drones, an official told us, and so this stabilization unit lacks patients. It is a chilling reminder of the manpower shortage Kyiv is dealing with after two years of war. The patients were led to a waiting ambulance, which left in the pitch black, its headlights off. Russia has targeted medical facilities before."

That tech offensive – conducted by Russia an hour before its ground assault began in February 2022 – aimed to disrupt Kyiv’s command and control in the pivotal early moments of the war, Western governments say . The cyberattack, which hit modems linked to a communication satellite, had far-reaching effects – stalling wind turbines in Germany and cutting the internet for tens of thousands of people and businesses across Europe. Following the attack, Ukraine scrambled for other ways to get online. For governments and security analysts , the cyberattack underscored how satellites –– which play an increasingly critical role helping militaries position troops, run communications, and launch or detect weapons – can become a key target during war. As countries and companies build out satellite constellations, a growing number of governments are vying for technology that could disrupt or even destroy adversaries’ assets – not just on land, like Russia’s alleged cyberattack – but in space too. Enter signal jamming and spoofing, high-powered lasers to dazzle imaging sensors, anti-satellite missiles and spacecraft with the capacity to interfere with others in orbit – counterspace technologies that analysts say leading powers like the United States, Russia and China could use to target each other’s satellites. An extreme example of a potential counterspace weapon was thrown into the spotlight earlier this year when US intelligence suggested, according to CNN reporting , that Russia was attempting to develop a space-based, anti-satellite nuclear weapon – a claim Moscow has denied . Far from only affecting military-use satellites, such a weapon could have broad, devastating impacts – for example, upending satellites the world relies on to predict the weather and respond to disasters, or even potentially affecting global navigation systems used for everything from banking and cargo shipping to hailing a ride share and ambulance dispatch. Last week, the US accused Russia of launching a satellite “presumably capable of attacking others in low Earth orbit,” with American officials saying it follows prior Russian satellite launches of likely “counterspace systems” in 2019 and 2022. Tracking countries’ development of counterspace capabilities is difficult, given their closely guarded nature and the dual use ambiguity of many space technologies. Both Russia and China have advanced their development of tech that could be used for such purposes in recent years, while the US builds on related space research and capabilities, according to experts and open-source reports. Development of counterspace technologies is playing out amid a new era of focus on space – where the US and China are competing to put astronauts on the moon and build research bases there and advances in satellite launch technology mean a growing number of actors, including US adversaries like North Korea and Iran, are putting assets in orbit. And as geopolitical rivalries mount on Earth, experts say Beijing and Moscow are increasingly interested in finding ways to deny the US – as the country with the most ground-based capabilities linked to space – the ability to use them. A rocket carrying the Queqiao communications relay satellite takes off from China's Xichang Satellite Launch Center in 2018. China's 2007 anti-satellite missile test was launched from the same center. AFP/Getty Images Counterspace race The idea of weapons aimed at or positioned in space remains highly controversial, but it isn’t new. Decades ago, the US and the Soviet Union vied for technologies to knock-out each other’s satellites, with Russia’s 1957 launch of Sputnik – the world’s first artificial satellite – quickly followed by US counterspace tests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, America has become the pre-eminent power when it comes to capabilities in space linked to conducting military operations on Earth, analysts say – a strength Russia and China have hoped to turn against it to even the battlefield. “Developing counterspace capabilities such as (anti-satellite) weapons provides a means to disrupt your adversary’s space-based capabilities, whether it is communication, navigation, or command and control systems and logistics networks that rely on space-based systems,” said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, director of the Center for Security, Strategy & Technology at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “Denying the US any advantage it may have from the use of space in a conventional military conflict is what is driving Russia and China in terms of their capability development and strategies,” she said. Direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles are fired from Earth to take out a satellite target in space. Illustration by CNN To this end, Russia is believed to have dusted off Cold War-era anti-satellite research programs, such as for the development of an “aircraft-borne laser system” to disrupt imagery reconnaissance satellites, according to an annual report by the independent US-based Secure World Foundation (SWF) released in March. New evidence suggests Russia may also be working to expand on its ground-based electronic warfare capabilities with the development of space-based technology for jamming satellite signals in orbit, said the report, which is compiled using open-source intelligence. Co-orbital anti-satellite technologies could be placed into orbit before moving toward their target for operations including attack. Satellites with robotic arms could both repair or interfere with other satellites. Illustration by CNN In recent years, Russia has also launched spacecraft that appear able to surveil foreign satellites – with the high velocity of two of these devices and suggestions others were able to release aerosols indicating they could be weapons tests, according to SWF. China announced its own counterspace ambitions in 2007 when it launched a missile some 500 miles into space to take down one of its own aging weather satellites. The move broke a decades-long, post-Cold War lull in such destructive, “direct ascent” anti-satellite missile testing, and was followed by similar operations from the US, India and Russia. Since then, China is believed by analysts to have conducted multiple, nondestructive missile tests that could advance its ability to target satellites. The most recent of those was last April, according to SWF, though, like others, that was described by Beijing as a missile intercept technology test. Jamming devices can disrupt communications to or from a satellite. Uplink jamming will interfere with the signal on its way from Earth to a satellite, while downlink disrupts the signal from a satellite to a ground-based user. Illustration by CNN China is also believed by the US Space Force to be “developing jammers to target a wide range of satellite communications” and to have “multiple ground-based laser systems.” Other Chinese operations in space are difficult to explicitly classify as weapons research but could have a military purpose, experts say . Those include satellites that can approach or rendezvous with others in orbit, such as for support and maintenance purposes, like the Shiyan-7, launched in 2013 and likely equipped with a robotic arm. There is suggestion from within China of the potential dual use of such technology. In a 2021 state media interview, Zang Jihui, a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) engineer, described China’s experiments with a satellite “equipped with a robotic arm, able to change orbit and conduct all-round detection of other satellites” as part of its “anti-satellite capabilities.” Beijing included safeguarding its “security interests in outer space” as among its national defense goals in a 2019 white paper , but has long said it stands “for the peaceful use of outer space” and opposes an arms race there. SWF says there is no confirmed public evidence of China using counterspace capabilities against any military targets. Russia has also said it opposes weapons in space. Both countries in recent years have established military forces dedicated to aerospace, as has the US, which launched its Space Force in 2019 as the first new military branch since 1947. US officials have described America as a leader in advancing the “responsible and peaceful use” of outer space. And given its reliance on space for its defense, experts say the US military has the most at stake when it comes to ensuring countries don’t use technologies against satellites there – one reason analysts say the US policy community has long shunned placing weapons in space. Among all nations, only non-destructive capabilities like signals jamming have been actively used against satellites in current military operations, according to SWF. ‘Deny’ China Since it took down one of its own malfunctioning satellites with a missile in 2008 after China’s test, Washington has pledged to no longer conduct such destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests, which can generate dangerous space debris, and is not believed to have an operational program for such capabilities. It also doesn’t have an acknowledged operational program to target satellites from within orbit using other satellites or spacecraft, though it could likely quickly field one in the future, according to SWF. Cyberattacks could target the operating systems and data of satellites or ground-based receivers and equipment to disrupt, intercept or break communications. Illustration by CNN That’s because the US has done extensive non-offensive testing of technologies to approach and rendezvous with satellites, including close approaches of its own military satellites and several Russian and Chinese military satellites, SWF says. The US only has one acknowledged, operational counterspace system – electronic warfare capabilities to interfere with satellite signals – and its army is widely seen to have advanced abilities to jam communications and capabilities to interfere with certain navigation satellites. It also has considerable research on ground-based lasers that could be used to dazzle or blind imaging satellites, according to SWF, which says there’s no indication those have become operational. Directed energy weapons, like lasers, could be used to temporarily dazzle or permanently disable a satellite’s image sensor or potentially damage its internal function. Illustration by CNN Speaking in Washington in November, US Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman explained why the US felt it needed to be able to counter other countries’ space capabilities. He pointed to what he described as a “kill web” strategy used by China’s PLA to enhance the range and accuracy of its weapons within the strategically important “second island chain,” running from Japan to Guam. “That is all a space-enabled capability,” Saltzman said. And should Beijing decide to use those weapons, “We have to be able to deny (China) access to the information to break that kill chain so that our joint forces are not immediately in target and in range inside the second island chain,” he said. Meanwhile, concerns about potential adversaries’ space activities have pushed US allies, including France and Australia , to seek counterspace abilities – often non-destructive ways to interfere with enemy satellites, known as “soft-kill” capabilities, such as lasers to disrupt surveillance and jamming. Israel has also said it used GPS jamming in its war in Gaza to “neutralize” threats , likely ground-based efforts to avert missiles that reach their target using GPS tracking. More broadly, there has been a trend toward shorter-term-impact measures like jamming, spoofing and cyberattacks that don’t permanently damage or destroy a target, according to Juliana Suess, a research fellow for space security at London-based defense think tank RUSI. “(Actors) don’t need to invest a whole lot of money into manufacturing these big sci-fi sounding anti-satellite weapons – they can just disrupt a whole network through a cyberattack,” she said.

Etienne Laurent/EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images ‘Wipe out’ More than 7,500 operational satellites are orbiting the Earth, according to the most recent figures from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in May 2023. Of those satellites, more than 5,000 were US-owned, with most of them commercial. Nearest competitor China – which has been increasing its satellite launches – had 628, followed by Russia with fewer than 200, according to UCS. Since it invaded Ukraine, Moscow has accused the West of using commercial satellite systems for military purposes and warned that “quasi-civil infrastructure may become a legitimate target for retaliation.” Russia has also been accused of mounting cyberattacks against the largest commercial satellite constellation, American company SpaceX’s Starlink, which has been an asset for the Ukrainian military . When it comes to allegations of developing a nuclear space-based weapon, Moscow has slammed the West as attempting to “assign to us a certain plan of action which we do not have.” A nuclear weapon in space would be a potential last-resort option – or hanging sword – for its potential to wipe out a wide swath of satellites, albeit indiscriminately.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner Lisi Niesner/Reuters Related article Ukraine relies on Starlink for its drone war. Russia appears to be bypassing sanctions to use the devices too If Russia is developing ﻿such a weapon, its concerns about American constellations like Starlink that have shown military utility are “likely a key motivating factor,” according to Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington. One reason is that as satellite constellations proliferate – aided by advances that have made launches in low Earth orbit (no more than 1,200 miles above the planet) cheaper and easier – it could be difficult for an attacker to cause an impact by simply targeting a single satellite. By contrast, “employment of such (nuclear) weapons in space could wipe out large satellite constellations, potentially creating long-lasting debris and radioactive remnants that render orbits unusable for military and civilian purposes,” Zhao said. That, he added, could also inflict “an inconceivable setback on the preservation of space as a common domain for future human development.” Chinese scientists have expressed concern about a potential national security risk of Starlink, with a group writing in the peer-reviewed domestic publication “Modern Defense Technology” in 2022 that “a combination of soft and hard kill methods should be adopted to incapacitate some Starlink satellites functioning abnormally and destroy the constellation’s operating system.” It’s unclear whether this view reflects thinking within the Chinese government. Chinese researchers have also considered the ramifications of nuclear detonation in space, with a separate group at a nuclear technology institute publishing research last year on computer simulations of the impact of such blasts at different altitudes, in which they noted there could be potential effects on satellites and other aircraft. The fallout from the 1962 Starfish Prime test was visible in the sky over Honolulu, Hawaii. EMP Commission Space treaty Nuclear weapons already have a controversial history linked to space. America’s 1962 Starfish Prime nuclear test some 250 miles over Earth damaged at least a third of the 24 satellites operating around that time, according to military documents. It also knocked out powerlines in Hawaii and turned the sky above it a violent shade of orange for hours. The test, launched from Earth, was part of series to evaluate the effect of such explosions, including against ballistic missiles. Five years later, countries concerned about the heating space race and nuclear standoffs banned the stationing of weapons of mass destruction in space with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which doesn’t explicitly ban conventional weapons in orbit or missiles launched from Earth. Though decades old, experts say that treaty – which affirms that space should be used for the benefit of all countries and is endorsed by Washington, Beijing and Moscow – remains a bedrock for a domain that lacks extensive international norms to ensure peace.

Last month, Russia vetoed an effort in the United Nations Security Council led by the US and Japan to reaffirm the Outer Space Treaty principles, including the obligation not to place nuclear weapons in space. The resolution would have been the council’s first on outer space and was supported by all other members besides China, which abstained. Instead, China and Russia, which have long worked together to shape rules around weapons in outer space, pushed for that resolution to be broadened to ban the placement of any weapons in space. Using language that appeared to target the US, it called on “all states, and above all those with major space capabilities” to prevent the “threat or use of force” in space. A second draft resolution backed by Russia that included that amendment, was rejected by the council last week, with the US calling it “disingenuous.” Any future efforts to agree on rules for space face a complicated outlook, experts say. For example, placement in space of a nuclear weapon like the one Russia is reportedly considering would have far-reaching implications on how space is used – and how weapons are controlled, according to RUSI’s Suess. “If the Outer Space Treaty was broken in such a way, it would make it even harder to imagine where multilateral efforts can go from here,” she said."

Among the dead is a 12-year-old girl, police said Sunday. The attack came as Russian forces continue to advance in northeastern Ukraine after crossing the border earlier this month and opening a new front in the two-year-old conflict. Kharkiv has seen a spate of Russian attacks, as Russia seeks to tie up Ukrainian forces elsewhere and create a buffer zone. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the strike a “brutal attack” in a post on X , later writing that “Russia is run by men who want to make it a norm – burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.” In his nightly address on Sunday, he said hundreds of personnel from State Emergency Services, police, and local authorities were involved in the response efforts. He also reiterated his calls for more air defense systems and stronger preventative measures against Russian forces. Officials have said there were nearly 200 people inside the building when the strike occurred. According to Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police Serhii Bolvinov, investigators and forensic experts spent the night searching the ruins of the store for human remains. “We fear that they will have to sift through the ashes to find the remains and identify the victims,” he continued. Ukraine’s Interior Minister, Ihor Klymenko, said Sunday that the hours following the strike were “hellish” and thanked everyone who helped to put out the flames that engulfed the hardware store after the attack. Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, noted that there is “not a single military object nearby” the site of the strike. He said the remains of 10 people who died in the strike had been identified and eight people were still missing. Meanwhile, further south in the Kherson region, authorities warned residents to avoid open spaces as there have been reports of explosions. “The enemy is attacking from the temporarily occupied left bank,” Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson City Military Administration, said in a Telegram post Sunday. “Do not stay in open areas. Take care of yourself and your loved ones,” he wrote. Fire spread through the hypermarket after the rocket attack. Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images Investigators and forensic experts are searching the ruins of the hardware store for human remains, authorities said. Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images Russian forces attacked Ukrainian frontline positions in Kharkiv 15 times over the weekend, General Serhii “Marcel” Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, said earlier on Sunday, adding that “some of the attacks are still ongoing.” Overnight Saturday into Sunday, Russian forces launched 14 missiles and over 30 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. Seven people were killed in Russian strikes on the city Thursday , after locations including a printing house were targeted. “Russia continues its savage attacks on Kharkiv this week, striking a busy shopping center, a book publishing house and other civilian targets,” US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said Saturday. “We condemn these attacks and commit to holding Russia accountable for its unprovoked war,” she added. After Saturday’s attack, Zelensky reiterated that “if Ukraine had enough air defense systems and modern combat aircraft, such Russian strikes would have been impossible.” “That is why we are appealing to all leaders, to all states: we need a significant strengthening of air defense,” he said. Zelensky has since appealed to US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to attend a peace summit in Switzerland next month. “Please, show your leadership in advancing the peace – the real peace and not just a pause between the strikes,” Zelensky said. “The efforts of the global majority are the best guarantee that all commitments will be fulfilled,” he added. Meanwhile, at least two people were killed and at least 10 injured as a result of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian village in the Belgorod region, the region’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday. Among the injured is an 8-year-old boy, he said, adding that “all victims had shrapnel wounds in various parts of the body.” As a result of the strike, a private residential building caught fire, and about 20 other buildings and 23 cars sustained damage. “All operational services are working on site,” Gladkov said.

Friday saw a wealth of noise about negotiation, in the same month Moscow launched a third invasion of Ukraine from the north of Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency cited four sources, in a report from two deeply experienced and connected Russia reporters , that Moscow was willing to consider peace talks which would freeze the current Russian occupation of about a fifth of Ukraine. Putin responded to that report by suggesting Russia was willing to talk peace, based on earlier agreements. He hinted at an aborted deal in Istanbul, just after the war began, in 2022, which fell apart, mostly because Moscow’s forces were still rampaging across Ukrainian territory, and massacres around Kyiv had come to light. CNN’s Nick Patton Walsh talks to Oleksandr inside a bunker in Lyptsi, Ukraine. Brice Lainé/CNN Related article ‘Everything is burning’: Battles rage outside Kharkiv as Ukraine tries to hold back Russian advance The idea floated in the Reuters report would stop short of Moscow’s stated goal of capturing all of eastern Donetsk, but also eradicate Kyiv’s insistence it should not surrender any territory. The context of Putin’s remarks was key. They came during a visit to Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko - something which in the past occurred moments before the Kremlin used Belarusian territory for military moves into Ukraine, while on Friday took place during joint tactical nuclear weapons drills between the two countries. Putin was talking peace with a backdrop that was anything but. Putin questioned the legitimacy of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who Moscow has repeatedly assailed, after Kyiv had to delay elections because of the very war Putin started. At the same time, there were unconfirmed reports that the private jet of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich had landed in Belarus. The pro-Russian Yanukovich fled Ukraine in 2014 after forces loyal to him shot dead dozens of protestors in central Kyiv. The mere possibility of his presence while Putin and Lukashenko met led to speculation Moscow was again hoping to engineer the return of a proxy to power in Ukraine. Unconfirmed reports allege that Viktor Yanukovich, the former president of Ukraine who was ousted by street protests and fled to Russia in 2014, has landed in Belarus. Tatyana Makeyeva/Reuters The Kremlin’s less brutal goal in Ukraine – short of full or partial occupation – has involved a president in Kyiv it considers loyal, who will stop the country’s march towards the European Union and NATO. It was fanciful before the 2022 invasion, and came up during the aborted 2022 Istanbul talks. But now it would likely need an occupying Russian force to impose it on a population seething at the Kremlin’s brutality. So why the talk of peace, particularly when Russia appears to be having its most successful moment on the frontlines in months, if not since the invasion? Diplomacy has always been a military tool for the Kremlin. It talked peace over Syria in 2015, as their jets pounded civilians in rebel-held areas . It talked peace in 2015 with Ukraine, while Russian troops and their proxies were in the throes of a full assault against the strategic Ukrainian town of Debaltseve. It is not cynical to distrust Russia’s sincerity when it negotiates, but a practical necessity. Experience shows it considers talks worth pursuing in case they unexpectedly produce a useful outcome without violence, or give their opponent cause for pause in fighting to try and encourage a deal. Moscow may also be talking peace again now for two reasons. Firstly, Ukraine and its allies are convening a peace summit in Switzerland in June, where it will discuss, without Russia, what sort of deal it might accept. It is likely aimed at building momentum for an off-ramp the Kremlin can take when its forces are finally militarily exhausted or in a stalemate. Zelensky has said he hopes China - Russia’s most potent ally but only partial supporter in the Ukraine war - will attend. Putin may be talking peace now to suggest to Beijing to not be involved in diplomacy about Russia without Russia present. There is little serious chance the Switzerland summit will end the war, but it might concretize minds in the West as to how serious a threat Moscow poses to an actual peace deal by laying out the bones of what damage Ukraine might have to absorb to its territorial integrity to stop the bloodshed. Russian troops have taken advantage of a weakened front line in Ukraine, and have advanced towards Kharkiv. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Friday that Putin’s hints at peace talks were directly aimed at sabotaging the summit. “Putin currently has no desire to end his aggression against Ukraine”, he wrote on X, adding “this is why he is so afraid of” the Switzerland summit. Secondly, and most importantly, Putin is messaging governments in the West and the current American presidential campaign. He is trying to opaquely suggest – perhaps to populists in Europe , or MAGA Republicans in the United States – that a simple deal is in hand, one in which frontlines, on which Ukraine is currently losing with significant casualties, can suddenly freeze. Western support for the war is costly, and increasingly unpopular – although the recent $61 billion passed by Congress has perhaps given the issue a reprieve from being at the mercy of electoral opinion for about a year. The Reuters report permits those in the West who want to see an end to the war to believe the Kremlin could stop the war, as it stands, immediately. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov made the report sound like it reflected Russia’s permanent position. But ultimately it may sound new and interesting to key Western figures: Donald Trump - who has failed to explain how he would enact his claim he could stop the war in 24 hours – and other NATO members who are less bullish than France, the UK and the Baltic states, about the need to never trust Russia at the negotiating table. Putin is a pragmatist. He started the war thinking it would be easy. He continued it thinking his tolerance for pain, autocratic security, and patience for victory would triumph. He might be right, just now. He now sees a moment of electoral weakness in the US, and other European states, which he has met with a vague, opaque signal that there might be a time for diplomacy. It will likely gain some traction among those who desperately hope the war in Ukraine will just go away, and who are less mindful of the existential threat a victorious and hyper-militarized Moscow poses to NATO’s eastern members. But it should be viewed through the lens of the deep cynicism of Moscow’s earlier diplomacy in Syria and Ukraine: used as a time to ferociously pursue the same military objectives, but with the illusory backdrop that peace might be just around the corner."

Now, the West is trying to turn that trickle of cash into a flood. Finance officials from the G7 economies met in Stresa, Italy to discuss new ways of using the proceeds from some €260 billion ($282 billion) of Russia’s foreign currency reserves that were frozen by Western countries after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Progress has been made … as far as the main issues are concerned,” Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said Saturday during a press conference after the meeting, adding that there are some legal technical issues that still have to be resolved. There is “strong positioning in terms of a political stance by all the G7 countries,” Giorgetti said. The G7 meeting comes just weeks after Russia mounted a surprise assault in Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv region. As Russia’s attacks intensify, Western leaders are coming under increasing pressure to deliver military aid to Kyiv’s stretched armed forces. It is “vital and urgent that we collectively find a way forward to unlock the value of Russian sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions for the benefit of Ukraine,” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a speech Tuesday in Frankfurt, Germany. The proposal that reportedly has the broadest backing among US and EU officials involves lending as much as $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the European Union as collateral. The plan “would essentially bring forward that flow of interest proceeds from the assets… (through a loan) given to Ukraine,” Yellen told broadcaster Sky News in an interview this week. “Ukraine has substantial needs, and being able to marshal significant resources to help Ukraine is important,” she said.

Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images G7 finance ministers hope to agree on a way forward that can be signed off when President Joe Biden and other leaders meet for a summit in Italy next month. The plan stops short of seizing the assets outright. The EU is worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Most of the frozen Russian money is held in Europe, and the euro is the world’s second-most important currency after the US dollar. The proposal “is a halfway house to full seizure,” Lee Buccheit, a veteran sovereign debt expert and honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School, told CNN. From $3 billion to $50 billion? Around two-thirds of Russia’s immobilized assets, or some €210 billion ($228 billion), sits in the EU, mostly at Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors. Following months of discussions, the EU formally adopted an agreement Tuesday that taps the windfall profits Euroclear makes by reinvesting the cash generated by those assets — such as coupon payments on bonds. Western sanctions mean coupon payments and maturing assets cannot be sent to Russia.

The first payment will be made in July, with 90% earmarked for arms and military equipment. The split of funds will be reviewed each year starting in January 2025, with the option to shift spending toward rebuilding Ukraine’s war-torn economy as its needs change. “The EU has chosen a way forward that is legally sound, and flexible so that support can adjust to Ukraine’s most pressing needs,” European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement Tuesday. Unlike the drip feed of funding agreed by the EU, the proposal under discussion by the G7 could deliver a much bigger lump sum, immediately. Reuters reported Yellen as saying Thursday that a figure of $50 billion had been discussed by G7 ministers but there was no agreement yet on how big the collateralized loan should be. An even bigger check? Apart from seizing the stash of assets, or lending Kyiv money backed by the interest they earn, there’s a third option the West might consider — a so-called reparations loan. Under this approach, Ukraine would borrow money from a syndicate of allies, including G7 members, and pledge as collateral its claim for reparations — or compensation — against Russia. This would give Kyiv access to a much larger amount of money than using future or current windfall profits from Russian assets. “Ukraine has a claim against Russia for reparations — legally, that is indubitable — and it would in effect be monetizing a portion of that claim by pledging it to secure this loan from the G7,” Buchheit, the debt expert, said. If Russia failed to pay reparations, then the G7 would be in a position to draw on the pool of frozen assets to recover the value of its loan to Ukraine, he added. This mechanism also ensures that Russia foots part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which the World Bank has put at $486 billion over the next decade. “Short of a regime change in Russia, Putin is never going to pay reparations,” said Buccheit. “This $300 billion is probably the only contribution Russia will ever make for paying reparations for what it has done to Ukraine.” Radina Gigova contributed to this article."

(Photo by Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images) Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu/Getty Images Related article Ukraine’s parliament scraps demobilization plans in bid to boost military Ukraine has made no secret of the urgent need to recruit more people as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression. While the government doesn’t reveal the number of dead and wounded, estimates made by experts speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides of the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. One Ukrainian commander who asked not to be named for security reasons said the personnel shortages are having devastating effects on the battlefield. “If there had been 1,000 to 1,500 more servicemen in Avdiivka , we would have protected the weak spots through which the enemy entered. … If we had more people, we would have held out much longer,” he told CNN of the eastern industrial city, which fell to Russian forces in February after Ukraine held it for more than a decade. Making the case for a new mobilization, Yurii Sodol, the commander of the Joint Forces of Ukraine’s military, told Ukrainian lawmakers last month that Russian troops outnumbered Ukrainian “seven to 10 times” in eastern Ukraine. This lack of personnel is putting immense pressure on those who are already serving. “The war is still going on and mobilization is essential. People who have been fighting for two years are tired. Some are going crazy,” said Yaroslav Galas, who is currently serving with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade. “Soldiers need proper rest for several months. They need to heal, relax and forget. They need to spend the money they have earned with sweat and blood, to solve their economic and personal issues,” he told CNN. A potential new recruit is being interviewed at the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion’s recruitment office in Kyiv in May 2024. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN To make the recruitment process more efficient and more transparent, the new law requires all Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 to register with the military and always have their documents on them. However, only men aged 25 to 60 are subject to mobilization under the new law. The lower limit has been slashed by two years from 27 years, but it’s unlikely to make much difference because of Ukraine’s demographic challenges. High emigration and low birth rates in the 1990s and 2000s mean there are far fewer people currently in their 20s, compared to those in their 30s and 40s. Women who have medical or pharmaceutical qualifications must also register with the military, although they are not required to serve. The new rules have been controversial – the draft law was amended more than 4,000 times during the approval process. ‘Desire to fight’ It is unclear how many people will end up being called up. Late last year, the leader of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s Servant of the People faction in parliament said the military was looking for an extra 500,000 servicemen and women. But the Commander-in-Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said recently that any increase in numbers would likely be significantly lower. Some military officers are already questioning whether it will work. Their main worry is that they’ll end up with units full of men who are only there because someone forced them to be.

Because there is a big difference between someone who was drafted into the army and someone who went to defend their homeland,” said Dmytro Kulibaba, a soldier with the 114th Territorial Defense Brigade. “The desire to fight the enemy is very important, in addition to training, equipment and preparedness,” he told CNN. Galas said that many people are worried that if they get drafted, they will be automatically sent to the frontlines – which he said is not the case. “If you are a specialist, for example, who in civilian life was engaged in IT, accounting, project management, even cooks, clerks, then the Armed Forces also need you … and you can also make a fairly large contribution to the common victory by joining the Armed Forces,” he said. “We have a separate drone unit who are a little further away from the frontline. People who are good at electronics, even those who like to play computer games, will quickly master this specialty.” ‘Sense of camaraderie’ One Kyiv-based business owner told CNN he had been researching his options long before receiving the draft notice in the mail. He knew it was coming, he said, he just didn’t know when. “I had been preparing for this for about a year or six months. I talked to my friends who are serving, I asked them about everything,” the 35-year-old said, explaining that his goal was to find a unit that would be a good fit for him. The man is currently in a training center and will be joining the army in couple of months, which is why he cannot be named by CNN.  He is currently considering two options  – reconnaissance or anti-aircraft missile troops. He said agreeing to serve was a clear choice for him – despite some of his loved ones trying to steer him away from it. “You think about all the options when you must make such a decision. How can I look my son in the eye when I say that I was somewhere (else)? I don’t know, it doesn’t work for me. I made a moral and ethical decision for myself. And then I had to decide with whom I would (feel most comfortable) serving with,” he said. Ukrainian artillery soldiers in a shelter in the direction of Kreminna, Ukraine, 17 May 2024. Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu/Getty Images Galas told CNN he believes the mobilization campaign has not been going well because it does not give people enough information. “It scares people away,” he said. “They don’t know what is happening in the combat brigades and it needs to be explained to them.” He said that despite the initial worry, many soldiers adapt well to their new life, giving an example of a young IT specialist who was mobilized within the past few months. “Once he joined this team, he saw that life in an infantry unit is not what civilians imagine. Yes, it is dangerous and difficult. But good people are there, and the bad ones don’t stay. There is a sense of camaraderie. And this is important,” he explained. The IT man had impressed his commanders immediately, he added. “He did very well during his first combat mission in Robotyno, holding positions 400 meters away from the Russians. He not only withstood assaults but also took prisoners,” he said. But not everyone is able to adjust to the realities of life on the frontline. The commanding officer who asked to remain anonymous spoke of another problem with the mobilization, saying that in recent times some recruits have not received the training they need to withstand the pressure. “The infantry being sent to the frontline needs to be given special training to make them real professionals. Because they come in here, drop their weapons, and run away from their positions,” he said. “There must be motivation for the current military and those about to serve. We cannot use the methods used in Russia or Belarus – catching and imposing – this will not help. It will only lead to people running away and giving up their positions,” he added. Running away But the military clearly isn’t for everyone. CNN spoke to one man who is determined to avoid serving no matter what. He asked to remain anonymous because he is afraid of retribution. “I don’t want to kill people, and in principle, I’m not ready for that. If shelling starts on the frontline, I think I will be confused and will only create problems for others,” he told CNN. “I think I’d be more useful making money and bringing dollars to the country than digging trenches or guarding military facilities,” he added. He said he believes Ukraine doesn’t have enough weapons to militarily reclaim territory seized by Russia in the war. The only way forward, he said, is a political agreement that would lead to Ukraine regaining its land. Ukrainian soldiers listen to instructions during training at an undetermined location in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on May 18, 2024. Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu/Getty Images The man said that if he was to receive a draft notice, he would leave the country. “I don’t want to leave; I know that things are not so beautiful and sunny in Europe. But if I had to choose between going to war or going abroad, I would choose abroad, I would pay a bribe. My life comes first. And I realize that there is a very high chance of being killed,” he said. The soldiers who are currently serving have little patience for men like this one, who say they can’t join the fight. “Soldiers who go on leave or for treatment, who are exhausted … of course that (seeing other men) drinking coffee in coffee shops, going to restaurants, pumping their biceps and (saying they were) ‘not born for war’ make soldiers angry,” Galas said. Unless they obtain a special permit, men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and last month, the government suspended consular services for men who are not registered with the military. Still, many attempt to run away anyway. Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for the Border Guard Service of Ukraine, told CNN his officers detain people trying to cross out of Ukraine on daily basis. Some are willing to risk everything trying to escape. The Border Service said that since the start of the full-scale invasion, the bodies of 32 men have been found in the Tysa River on the border with Romania and Hungary.

The top US diplomat said the new tranche of assistance “contains urgently needed capabilities” for Ukrainian troops as they fight to hold back Russia’s advances toward the key northeastern city. “We will move this new assistance as quickly as possible so the Ukrainian military can use it to defend their territory and protect the Ukrainian people,” Blinken said in a statement. In a post on X Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his gratitude for the new aid package, saying it “is critical right now, as the enemy intensifies attacks along the frontline.” “Today in Kharkiv, I witnessed firsthand the importance of strengthening our warriors in order to protect our people, our cities, and our communities. Freedom is the value both of our nations hold dear. To protect it, we require continued strong support from the United States and other allies,” Zelensky wrote. Russian forces have advanced toward Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, after launching a surprise cross-border assault in mid-May. Seven people were killed in a barrage of Russian missile strikes Thursday. Ukrainian forces have been forced to contend with weapons shortfalls as they fight to hold off the advances. CNN journalists in the town of Lyptsi , around 20 miles north of Kharkiv city, saw troops using aging and inadequate weaponry, in an attempt to repel highly equipped Russian units bolstered by drones. The latest US military assistance package – the fifth since the passage of a multi-billion dollar national security funding package – includes artillery rounds, Javelin and TOW missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), demolitions munitions, anti-armor mines, tactical vehicles, and body armor, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear protective equipment, Blinken said. The top US diplomat traveled to Ukraine last week to reaffirm the US’ support to Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials after the passage of that national security supplemental. “We are determined that Ukraine win this war and succeed for its people and for its future,” Blinken said at a press conference alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “We’re committed to making sure that Ukraine has the equipment it needs to succeed on the battlefield.” However, the US has continued to say its weapons cannot be used by Ukraine to strike Russian targets on Russian territory. “We have not encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine,” Blinken reiterated last week. Meanwhile, G7 finance ministers are meeting in Italy to discuss plans to marshal Russian assets that were frozen overseas at the outset of the war toward Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction, according to people familiar with the matter. The plan, if finalized, would see US and European banks redirect tens of billions of dollars in proceeds from Russian investments toward Ukraine – providing a critical financial lifeline as the continued political wherewithal by Ukraine’s major benefactors remains uncertain.

Russian troops have taken advantage of a weakened front line in Ukraine, and for the past two weeks have advanced towards Kharkiv. Parts of the region were captured by Russian forces earlier in the war before being liberated. All seven of the deceased, at least five of whom were women, were civilians working for the Factor-Druk printing company in the region’s capital, the city of Kharkiv, according to the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. Sixteen people were injured at the at printing house, located south of the city center, and another seven were injured elsewhere. After the attack, images emerged of the factory partly reduced to rubble, with its facade blown off.

The Ukrainian state railway network was also attacked in the early morning, according to a statement from the company. Six employees were wounded, the company said. A CNN team travelling in the area saw two craters and smoke from impacts near a railway line. Civilians have also been trapped by a new swell of violence engulfing the region. On May 15, Russian forces fired on people desperately trying to flee the town of Vovchansk and killed a woman being pushed in a wheelchair by her husband, Ukrainian prosecutors reported. ‘Extremely brutal’ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the “extremely brutal Russian attack” on Kharkiv and the town of Lyubotyn, drawing attention to the fragility of Kyiv’s air defenses in the face of Moscow’s renewed assault. “Russian terrorists are taking advantage of Ukraine’s lack of sufficient air defense protection and reliable capability to destroy terrorist launchers at their exact locations, which are close to our borders,” Zelensky posted on X. Earlier this month, the US approved a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons to Ukraine.

But the grip the nation keeps is tenuous: The streets are aflame from an airstrike moments earlier when we race in, under the cover of darkness. Night affords them the only respite from drone assault; the hours before we arrive have seen the town hit eight times. Yet the soldiers of the 13th Khartiia National Guard have to endure, as the stakes here are huge. Russia’s relentless onslaught has a key goal: If they take Lyptsi, then they can position artillery within range of Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, 20 minutes down the road. Down in a bunker, Oleksandr, a commander, looks at one of his many drone feeds. “You saw yourself how everything is burning.

Nothing. Just nothing. All the positions are being built by the hands of infantry.” Ukrainian commander Artun. Mick Krever/CNN Outside, the night is shaken by more blasts. “Three weeks ago the civilians were living a peaceful life here. Rebuilding, everything was all right,” he says. “And now most of the houses are ruined.” As we leave, a loud drone buzzes overhead, close by. Our escort does not flinch or run. I ask if the drone is friendly. “How the f*** should I know?” he replies, tugging on a cigarette. All around the city of Kharkiv, home to an estimated million civilians, Ukrainian forces are trying to hold back a persistent Russian assault from multiple angles. Over a week reporting in the villages around the city, CNN saw Ukrainian units holding their positions at great peril and risk, and sometimes using aged and scant artillery to fend off a much better equipped Russian force, able to thwart their most basic maneuvers with huge numbers of drones.

The gun was partially hidden by a wire net, aimed at providing some protection from an attack drone. Yet above, an unidentified scout drone began to hover, forcing the unit to run into a bunker. Another unit is forced to use a Soviet artillery gun made in the 1940s. Hidden in dense foliage, its metal is rusty in parts, limiting how often it can be fired. Artun, their commander, uses newer Polish shells, but now only fires 10 a day, when in the autumn it was 100. Drones are “a big problem,” Artun says. “I have shrapnel in me as a keepsake,” he adds, referring to the remnants of a Russian Lancet drone still in his hand and stomach, which the surgeons could not remove. “But there are certain actions that can save you from drones.” One of them springs into life: an alert from a $30 frequency scanner on his webbing. It has picked up the approach of another Orlan drone, sending Artun into the bunker. He looks out into the sky above, and sees it pass overhead.

Brice Lainé/CNN For nearly two years, Kharkiv thought the threat from its neighbour had passed. A lightning Russian retreat in late 2022 left Kharkiv region peaceful and the launchpad for Ukrainian attacks across the border into Russia proper. Attacks persisted in the distance however, keeping the city’s residents awake through violently loud nights, now amplified by the threat of Russian artillery edging closer. Flares, anti-aircraft fire, and blasts regularly punctuate the enforced blackout, as Russian drones, rockets and airstrikes hit targets in the dark. On Wednesday, city officials reported an attack on a gas station, which left four people in hospital. On Sunday, two missiles struck a lakeside resort in Cherkaska Lozova, outside the city — a horrifying attack on a civilian target which also used a “double-tap” tactic, in which a second missile hit 10 minutes after the first, injuring first responders. A few hours after Sunday’s blasts, rescue workers clambered over the ruins of a waterside terrace, retrieving two bodies from the seven who died in the attack. One was a woman, seven months pregnant. Another was only found later, their body fragments in the wreckage.

The man managed to reach the outskirts of the Vovchansk, where he met Ukrainian soldiers who took him to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Situation in Vovchansk worsening for civilians Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly urged civilians to evacuate from Vovchansk and frontline areas because of the heavy fighting. Ukrainian officials have previously said Russian forces have captured dozens of civilians in Vovchansk, and a top regional police officer has accused them of using civilians as “human shields.” CNN is unable to independently verify the claims that Russia is using civilians as human shields and has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry for comment.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/russia-ukraine-war-migrating-eagles-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"The Ukraine war is forcing migrating eagles to change their flight paths, scientists say",Greater spotted eagles are already a species under threat and scientists have found that they have been facing yet another danger: the war in Ukraine.,"May 22, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Amarachi Orie,Ukraine,"CNN — Greater spotted eagles are already a species under threat. Now, scientists have found that they have been facing yet another danger: the war in Ukraine . Eagles have been exposed to conflict events while migrating through Ukraine, forcing them to deviate from their usual flight path, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. Listed as “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, greater spotted eagles have been largely eradicated from western and central Europe, according to the study. However, Polesia, a large wetland region that borders Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, remains a stronghold for the species. On March 1, 2022, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, the first of 21 tagged greater spotted eagles crossed into Ukraine on its usual migration, according to researchers from the UK and Estonia. “When the conflict started in February 2022, we were kind of watching things unfold on the news like everyone else, but sitting there also with the feeling that we know our birds are about to pass through that area and wondering what that might mean for them,” lead study author Charlie Russell, a conservation scientist and ornithologist who is studying for his PhD at the UK’s University of East Anglia, told CNN Tuesday. Using conflict data and GPS tracking, the researchers quantified the impact of the conflict on the migratory behaviour of 19 eagles who were passing though Ukraine northward to breeding grounds in southern Belarus between March and April 2022. Measured against a typical nectar feeder, the size of the Northern Giant Hummingbird is especially astonishing. Xiaoni Xu/Macaulay Library/Cornell Lab Related article Scientists solve giant hummingbird mystery — with the help of tiny backpacks The study authors found that the eagles diverted significantly from their usual flight path when compared to pre-conflict migrations between 2019 and 2021, with the eagles flying further and less directly to breeding grounds. While the researchers did not have direct observational evidence to determine the stimuli the birds could respond to, they thought noise and light from military activities could have affected their behavior. The deviations were found to be greater at areas where the route of migration coincided with more military activity, but it differed for each bird due to varying exposures and responses to conflict, according to the researchers. Due to greater deviations, the birds had to travel further and their migrations also took longer to complete. Females, for example, spent an average of 246 hours travelling to breeding grounds, rather than the pre-conflict time of around 193 hours, according to the study. The eagles travelled 85 kilometers (53 miles) further on average and, in an extreme case, one bird flew an extra 250 kilometers (155 miles) further compared to previous years, Russell said. Males were found to travel more slowly, averaging a speed of around 7.66 meters (25 feet) per second, rather than the pre-conflict average of around 9.75 meters (32 feet) per second. The researchers observed no difference in migration performance and deviation patterns outside of Ukraine, according to the study. Potential breeding risk The other significant finding was that the birds were making less stopovers than in previous years. Stopover sites are essential places for the eagles to get food, water, rest and refuel, and shelter from poor weather during their long journeys, according to researchers. While 18 tracked individuals – 90% of the tracked eagles – made stopovers in Ukraine while migrating between 2018 and 2021, only six made stopovers in 2022. In the years before the conflict, 11 of the eagles used common stopover sites in Ukrainian Polesia, but these sites were not used at all in 2022. “The combination of these two things, having to fly forever and expend more energy, and the reduced ability to recover that energy, is something that we think will have had sublethal fitness costs, which might have carried over into the breeding period that year,” Russell added. Reduced fitness and the delayed onset of breeding due to spending more time recovering from the journey could reduce breeding success, which is already relatively low in the population, as well as impact chick provisioning and the fledgling date of young birds, according to the study. “I think it’s very important to understand the different stresses that the environment is facing as a result of conflict so that in a post-conflict setting, we can better support not just greater spotted eagles but the wider ecosystems as well to recover,” Russell said. Fossil named 'Attenborough’s strange bird' was the first in its kind without teeth Ville Sinkkonen Related article ‘Strange bird’ specimen might have looked like any other bird 120 million years ago — until it opened its mouth “We know very little about the impacts of human conflicts on wildlife, particularly when it comes to migratory species, so this study plugs an important knowledge gap,” professor Nathalie Pettorelli, an applied ecologist and senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, told CNN Tuesday. Pettorelli, who was not involved in the study, added that understanding what affects the eagles’ survival is “key” to ensuring they have a future. “More broadly, human conflicts are on the rise globally, stressing the need for more research on the impacts of conflicts on biodiversity and, where possible, for the development of effective mitigation policies,” Pettorelli said. Ukraine accused Russia of “ecocide” after suffering an environmental catastrophe in July due to the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country that led to more than 100 people being killed, as well as the destruction of farmland and nature reserves. Russell said the war in Ukraine is “really raising the profile of some of the environmental issues caused by conflict. And it’s not just in Ukraine. This is something that’ll be happening to different extents at other conflict zones as well.”"

The “Code 9.2” drone unit, from the 92nd assault brigade, are moving into a new launch position from where they are about to conduct a rare and potent mission: flying drones into Russia and dropping mines onto key roads inside enemy territory. Twilight provides a moment of opportunity to set up new equipment and unload their Humvee before dark makes these complex tasks impossible. They can only hope the grey, fading light shields them from the endless stream of Russian drones that fly overhead, looking for something to strike. A Starlink dish, a longer range drone antenna, dozens of battery packs, and two huge “Vampire” quadcopters are dumped into trenches and bunkers, set up, and in use within 30 minutes. It is only when the dark has set in that their work can begin. And immediately the threat is apparent. Before operators Andrey and Artem can leave the bunker to begin work, a noise sends them rushing back in for cover. “Sssshhh,” Andrey hisses. “Orlan.” The only way to protect yourself from being seen by an Orlan – a spotter drone that can also have thermal cameras enabling it to see in the dark – is to hide. And to silently listen for it to pass. “They will be flying all night,” he says. The horizon is peppered with flashes – distant explosions. Across its center twinkles the Russian city of Belgorod, now repeatedly hit by Ukrainian strikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed his week-old offensive into Kharkiv region in Ukraine is partially aimed at creating a buffer zone along the border to protect a population whose safety was never in doubt when he launched his invasion in February 2022. The bunker is quickly turned into an operations hub, the team finding it hard to adjust to the silent open fields of their new home, after months of fierce battles around Bakhmut. It is only when the dark has set in that the work of Ukrainian drone unit 'Code 9.2' can begin. Brice Lainé/CNN In the silence, Artem says, “you don’t know, will you get hit or not.” He points out the difference with Ukraine’s failed defense last year of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region – and their work tonight, about four miles from the border. Here the heavy foliage, lack of fixed front lines and proximity to Russia means “reconnaissance groups enter and can get anywhere.” They joke they could wake up to a Russian soldier standing over them. For Artem though this fight is intensely personal. His parents still live in a partially destroyed village a short drive away. For 18 months he deceived them by saying he was stationed at a peaceful checkpoint, when he was really fighting on the front lines. Now they know he is nearby, and the feeling of fighting for his actual home leaves him feeling unsettled. “Anxiety,” he says of the main feeling. “My parents are right here so if, God forbid, we fail somehow, if there is a breakthrough… it’s a big responsibility.” Dark has set in, punctured only by the flashes of artillery strikes and the near-full moon. The team move to work fast. Artem and Andrey race to attach the mines to the drone, using only red lights. Suddenly, a tiny whining noise is audible. “Run,” says Andrey, and they take cover in a nearby bunker. Spotted once, the trenches could become a target for airstrikes and artillery all night, and there is little chance to escape: they have no vehicle and racing across open ground on foot is perilous too. A few minutes pass. Flares illuminate an adjacent field. Battles are raging elsewhere too. The team resumes work. Zip ties prime fuses. Masking tape readies explosive. Then again, another drone passes close by, and they race again for shelter. Twilight provides a moment of opportunity for the unit to set up new equipment and unload their Humvee before dark makes these complex tasks impossible. Brice Lainé/CNN Interrupted twice, and a little breathless from racing for cover, the team are finally ready to launch. Back in the bunker, the pilot Sasha can see fields flow below the Vampire on its night vision camera. He points out the border line, and then adds: “Now, we are already in Russia”. “Did you bring your passport?” quips Artem. “I can go without a visa,” replies Sasha. Being funny used to be the third team member’s job, before the war dragged Ukrainians of disparate professions into trenches. Andrey was a comic, and briefly worked with Volodymyr Zelensky – long before his days as a politician and Ukrainian president when he was a TV producer and actor – on his comedy show. “Honestly, he had one of the best vibes among the people I met,” he says. “The strongest energy. It is always interesting with him. We spent a lot of time together, one on one.” The owner of the printing house ""GUROV I K,"" Dmytro Gurov, shows the damage caused by a Russian missile. He says there are about a million dollars in damages, but he has decided to restore the business. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN Related article ‘No panic… no one is running away.’ Residents of Kharkiv defy threat of Russia’s advancing forces It is a peculiar trait of the Ukrainian force, compared to their enemy: it is unlikely any of Putin’s troops spent time on stage with the Kremlin head cracking jokes before the war. The drone flies deeper into Russia, and then warning messages ring out loudly in the bunker, on grating repeat, signalling that GPS jammers are at work. Sasha is briefly concerned they may lose the drone. The livestream cuts. He thumbs the controls agitatedly. But then minutes later, the signal is restored: the drone has flown through the interference, kept on course, and can now continue towards the target. Moments later, two packages drop from its underbelly. The mines sit on the road, and later the next day, the unit says, hit one armored car and a soft skin vehicle. As the drone approaches, the team have two problems. Firstly, its GPS system appears damaged and it crashes unceremoniously into the field, upside down. Secondly, they think they can see an Russian Orlan that appears to have followed the drone back into Ukraine, perhaps seeking their launch position. The team stay in shelter a few minutes, hoping the threat passes. Shells whistle overhead and crash into nearby fields. They retrieve the drone, but must rely on their spare until dawn, when daylight will give them a chance to assess the damage. The sorties continue, the team saying they hold the record for the most Vampire flights in one night of 24. But their target now is Russia itself, a powerful symbol of Kyiv’s decision to take the fight back to Moscow, and the new, dangerous escalatory turns this conflict is taking in its third year."

But in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, life cracks on. Upstairs at the Che champagne bar on Sumska Street, girlfriends arrive in twos and threes, dressed to impress. They take photos of each other, backlit in pink and gold, and framed by floor-to-ceiling shelves of Moët & Chandon. “We are all 1654,” it says on the wall and on the sugar sachets, a reference to the year the city was founded. The last two years have been among the toughest. Just across the street from Che is the regional government headquarters. On March 1, 2022 - the sixth day of Russia’s war – CCTV caught the moment it was struck by two missiles. Today, the windows are boarded up, but the exterior is in surprisingly good order. A huge poster hangs over the front bearing words all Ukrainians know. Keep fighting — you are sure to win! God helps you in your fight! For fame and freedom march with you, And right is on your side! On March 1, 2022, CCTV caught the moment regional government headquarters were struck by two missiles. CNN / The State Emergency Service of Ukraine When we meet businessman and philanthropist, Yuriy Sapronov, outside a café after lunch, he has just been updated about the battlefield situation by soldiers along the border. The news is not good. Russians have pushed through in two areas in a four-battalion effort. Sapronov reckons the aim is to draw Ukrainian forces away from positions defending Chasiv Yar in the Donbas region to the southeast. He draws a map on the paper place-setting in front of him explaining how far Russia needs to advance to get its artillery in range to hit the city. He’s confident they won’t succeed because Ukraine has moved combat-hardened brigades to defend those positions. Not that it will stop Russia sending S-300 missiles and guided aerial bombs towards Kharkiv. The fastest of them will make impact within a minute of being launched, so close is the city to Russia. “Everyday genocide,” says Sapronov. The businessman was born in Kaliningrad, now a part of Russia, then a part of the Soviet Union, more than 60 years ago. His father was in the Soviet air force and when the time came for him to step into the reserves, he was told he could move his family to almost any location he wanted. He chose Kharkiv for its universities, to give Yuriy and his sister a good place to study. Sapronov himself became a businessman after abandoning his job as a chemistry teacher in the chaos of the Soviet Union’s demise. He traded in metals, oil and computers, before later moving into construction. This monument is dedicated to children killed during the war. The sign reads: ""They were killed by Russia."" Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN “Money was just lying at my feet back then,” he says. It is very different now. His businesses have ceased. Instead, he raises money for the army, and chips in himself. Anything from drones to generators, from motor vehicles to power banks. Local brigades tell him what they need; he pays for some of it and secures financing for the rest. We ask Sapronov why he is still here. As a man older than fighting age, he could leave the country, or at least move to a quieter part of Ukraine. But his mind was clear from the very beginning, he says. His wife asked him the day after the war began what they were going to do. He told her they were staying put. “In my passport it is written that I am Russian by nationality. But I am not Russian, I am Ukrainian,” Sapronov says.

She says she hopes the hotel will re-open one day. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN Olha Sokolenko is not a Kharkiv native either. The hotel manager came to the city from Kyiv 15 years ago. On December 30 last year, she was leading her team at the Kharkiv Palace Hotel, getting ready for a New Year’s Eve party the next day. At 7 p.m., a Russian missile crashed into the building’s fitness center on the 11th floor, exploding three floors down. She shows us a massive hole left by the missile as it passed through a bedroom floor. Fifteen rooms were occupied at the time of the attack, all on lower floors for safety. About 20 staff were on duty. Remarkably, no one was killed and only one person was injured and needed treatment. Olha herself was among the most fortunate. She was right there on the 11th floor when the missile struck, but on the other side of the building. “It seems my work on this earth isn’t done,” she says wryly, when we suggest she must feel very lucky. The memory will never leave her, though, especially the sound of the missile strike. “Terrible, like a very strong lightning strike,” she recalls. It was only a few hours afterwards that rescuers recovered her phone, covered in dust but still working. There was a load of missed calls, not just from friends and family, but from people all over the world – one-time guests at the hotel, checking she was OK. Russians hit the building, she says, because they claimed there were important decisions being taken by people inside. In fact, Olha says, there were only civilians in the building – mostly journalists and people preparing to celebrate New Year with their families. “This hotel has been my life’s work,” she says. “Peace will come, and guests will return to Kharkiv.” FC Metalist Kharkiv Matviy Kolotay, an academy player at FC Metalist Kharkiv, watches the first team play a match after Saturday training. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN Matviy Kolotay is 15 years old and his favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo. It is an opinion widely held among the boys of the academy of FC Metalist Kharkiv, who have piled into a small room after Saturday training to watch the first team in action against Hirnyk Sport. Matviy has been with the club since 2021 but he amazes us when he explains that while he lives in Kharkiv, his family lives in Kremenchuk, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away in the safer center of the country. “My parents are worried for me, but the main thing is that I am playing football,” he says. The war is not something he likes to talk about. Coaches lead the academy players at FC Metalist Kharkiv in a Mexican Wave as they watch a match together on a screen CNN “Me-ta-list! Me-ta-list!” the boys roar. They are led by Mikhaylo Galushko, one of the coaches. Every club needs a man like him. Someone to get the chant going, a man who claps his hands together with such force you can feel the audio peaking inside your head. FC Metalist play their games in Uzhhorod, the farthest point you can get from Kharkiv without leaving Ukraine. It takes more than a day to get there on the train. The boys shout at the screen like football supporters everywhere, appealing every dodgy decision by the referee. “Even in this difficult time, the children come here, and we give them the attention they deserve. Thanks to sport, thanks to our attention, they are distracted [from the war] and forget about everything that is going on,” Galushko says. It is no easy task. An air raid siren the day before had lasted the entire day and all training was canceled. If the alarms go off halfway through a session, the boys are taken to the bomb shelter. The banter resumes the moment they are inside. “All conversations are turned into jokes, so the boys are not afraid.” We tell Galushko that one of the CNN team supports English football club Everton. “Ah, you remember, the match?” he says, referring to a UEFA Cup tie between the teams in 2007. “We let you win!” Had he at any point thought of leaving Ukraine in the last two years? “We never went anywhere. When the war started, my younger son was at a tournament in Poltava. While everyone was leaving Kharkiv, he was coming back to Kharkiv on an empty train,” Galushko says. “My family is all in Kharkiv. Two children, both play football. I do not want to go anywhere. This is my homeland.” Kharkiv’s mayor Kharkiv's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, was elected just a few months before the Ukraine war broke out. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN The city’s mayor Ihor Terekhov speaks slowly and quietly, pausing to allow his translator to render carefully his Ukrainian into English, sentence by sentence. The war started just a few months after he was elected mayor at the end of 2021. We are talking just a few hours after Russia began its latest offensive, immediately to the north. What President Volodymyr Zelensky would later that day call a new wave of counteroffensive actions comes after months of increased Russian air strikes on the city. By the end of March, they had knocked out the entire region’s power generating capacity, as well as all its electricity substations. Street lights are now completely switched off and there are rolling blackouts from one neighborhood to another. The underground rail network is still running, one train every 20 minutes. Pre-war, they ran every two to three minutes. Still, it works. For the mayor of Kharkiv, one message matters more than any other: the people of his city are staying put. Russia will not drive them out. “As we can see [today], the Russian aggressors have intensified their actions on the border in several directions [..] But, despite everything, you can see the city is alive, that no one is running away,” Terekhov says, through his translator. “This is the main thing. There is no panic.” Most people though will tell you the city has lost people in recent months. Not like the first few months of the war, when the population shrunk from about 1.5 million to 300,000, before many returned as Ukraine’s fortunes improved later in the year. But some families are now choosing to move to safety again as the Russian threat re-emerges. Even so, the mayor shakes his head when we ask him if numbers have declined since the start of the year. “No,” he says, before correcting himself. “There was a slight decrease. A few people have left. A few others have returned.” Café Snidanishna A large Hyundai generator sits just inside the door of Café Snidanishna, which lies about a mile north from the city center. It is off when we arrive because the power in the city is switched on. Co-owner Borys Lomako explains they only really need it to keep the lights and the coffee machine working. The oven is wood fired. Traditional Ukrainian crafts are given prominence at Café Snidanishna alongside the cuisine. This jug is from the Poltava region. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN It is a gem of a place. We order chicken liver pate, served with red berries, and freshly made bread, toasted. Along with two friends, both fellow entrepreneurs, he opened the café three months ago. Revenues from some of their other interests, predominantly a confectionery business, help to support it. “It’s not really a business model, it’s primarily about keeping my life in Kharkiv. To send signals both to Kharkiv residents who stay here that life goes on, and signals to those outside of Kharkiv that Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city and people live here.” Lomako explains that he and his partners traveled across the country to collect local recipes and techniques. There is gombovtsi on the menu – a sweet dough from the Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine’s far southwest. And kachina kasha - porridge made from rolled millets dipped in egg and flour, from the Naddniprianshchyna region, along the Dnipro River. Preparing the dish is time-consuming, Lomako says, and that is the point. It takes time. It is hard work. “Even just choosing to eat Ukrainian food means that we are choosing Ukraine,” he says. He articulates the existential threat most Ukrainians feel about Russia’s invasion, the certainty that Russians want to wipe out their history and their culture. When we are talking, a little after 9 a.m., Kharkiv is already on its third air raid siren of the day, and the cross-border offensive is into its second day and making progress. “As I see it, this is a choice of life. Every day we can choose death or life. And choosing to eat, choosing to go to restaurants, choosing to cook for people is a choice to live, not to die. Yes, this is resistance for me, it is creative resistance.” Dmytro Gurov’s destroyed printing house Video Ad Feedback The owner of the printing house ""GUROV I K,"" Dmytro Gurov, points to where the Russian missile exploded. 00:29 - Source: CNN Video Ad Feedback The extensive damage caused to the printing house. 00:44 - Source: CNN Gurov stands in the remains of the printing house. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN Walking through the burned-out wreckage of Dmytro Gurov’s 5,000-square-meter printing business is an almost overwhelming experience. Twisted metal girders and air vents, plaster and ceiling tiles gone, all windows blown out. Everywhere, remnants of the puzzles, children’s card games, books and magazines that once rolled out of machines here. Cutting machines, printing machines, laminating machines. A million bits of torn paper. All covered in dust. And the taste of the blast and the fire that followed are still clear on the tongue, almost two months on. The weapon that did all this was originally designed to sink ships. It flew low around the city, evading air defenders, before ending its flight right here, killing five and wounding 20. We ask Gurov if he is angry over what has become of the business he started back in 2007. It would feel like a reasonable response. “It is not going to help. There is no time to sit around crying and blaming someone for something. The question here is: what do we do next? If we are going to recover, then how?” Government assistance should bring in about $200,000, but the cost of the strike runs into millions, he says. In fact, rebuilding began immediately. Employees came in the next day offering to work for nothing. Some machines could be salvaged and the first of those cleaned up and moved to another workspace were working again within a month. “Like a phoenix,” Gurov says. Kharkiv theater goes underground This theater in Kharkiv is one of several city institutions forced underground by the war. Daria Tarasova-Markina/CNN A small theatre audience watches as the female character on the roof says she is ready to jump. But the man, a stranger, isn’t so sure. “Just look down there, it’s a right mess, there is rubbish everywhere,” he says ironically. The Kharkiv State Theater should be playing in front of 900 people. Now the actors perform in a basement club with just enough space for six rows of audience. Since the start of the year, it has become one of several city institutions forced underground by the war. Schools, too, are slowly going subterranean. Big productions with large casts are impossible in such a small space, director Oksana Stetsenko says. But at least they no longer need to pause the play and exit the playhouse whenever the sirens go off. “We have to adjust, adapt, but still do our job. We must do our job,”Stetsenko says. She chose the play, “Suicide of Loneliness,” by Ukrainian playwright Neda Nezhdana, because it is about people making choices. “We are all individuals.” She is thinking of the soldiers, too. “There are individuals at the front. They are not a biomass. An individual makes his or her own choice, thinks, draws conclusions, and says to himself or herself: I want beautiful things, I want eternal things, I want peace, I want well-being for my family, for my children.”"

He was responding to a question from CNN’s Jim Sciutto about whether he holds the US responsible for the delay in aid which Russian forces have been able to take advantage of and advance further into Ukraine. Kuleba’s comments come after Moscow has ramped up its offensive in northern Ukraine. Last week it launched its most surprising operation in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country’s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. A pillar of smoke rises from behind apartment blocks after the shelling of Russian troops in Kharkiv on Friday. Ukrinform/NurPhoto/Getty Images Analysts say Russia was prepared for the hiatus in Western military aid to Ukraine and has exploited it for its own gain. “Ukraine may need to make difficult decisions due to slowness of US action and the dilemma that is now causing,” George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington previously told CNN. It comes as Kyiv’s forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, inadequate air defenses and a lack of soldiers. Kuleba described Ukraine’s current position on the frontline as “tough.” “Russia is strong, we are suffering from… insufficient supplies of military assistance which we are forced to compensate with heroism and sacrifice of our soldiers,” he said. “So the main message remains the same: send us everything. Because we have proven over these two years that when our soldiers have everything they need, we succeed, and when we don’t have everything that we need, we don’t,” he added. A Ukrainian serviceman fires a howitzer toward Russian troops in Donetsk region. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters The foreign minister went on to say the situation on the battlefield would be different if countries did more to assist Ukraine, claiming that if every country were to follow Estonia’s footsteps in allocating 1% of GDP to military aid for Ukraine they would be able to perform better on the battlefield. “Estonia is a country that proves to the whole world that a small country with a big heart can make a big difference and it’s a paradigm for everyone to follow,” he said. Kuleba said Ukraine will “work hard on plan A which is the continuation of support and ramping up support to make Ukraine win.” CNN’s Tim Lister contributed to this report."

Last week it launched its most surprising operation in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country’s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. The cross-border attack came in a difficult month for Kyiv and marked another example of what’s going wrong for the Ukrainians this year. Their forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, grossly inadequate air defenses and above all a lack of soldiers. Their plight has been worsened by dry weather, allowing Russian mechanized units to move more easily. The deputy head of Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, told the Economist last week: “Our problem is very simple: we have no weapons. They always knew April and May would be a difficult time for us.” Several analysts expect the Russians to broaden the border attacks westwards to Sumy region, which has seen months of raids by Russian special forces. In effect, the Russians have the manpower to stretch Ukrainian defenses through multiple points of attack hundreds of kilometers apart, forcing Kyiv to guess where and when an anticipated early-summer offensive will focus. Serhii Bolvinov, head of the investigative department of the Kharkiv regional police, told public broadcaster Suspilne News on Friday that Russian soldiers had kept about 40 civilians in a basement, near their “command headquarters.” The people are being interrogated, and “those conducting the interrogations call themselves FSB employees,” Bolvinov said, referring to Russia’s domestic security agency, adding that the captives are being used as “human shields.” He said the captives were mostly elderly people who “didn’t want to evacuate until the very end” and were captured when they finally decided to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Bolvinov said an elderly Vovchansk resident was killed by Russian soldiers after refusing to obey their orders and trying to escape on foot. The details came a day after Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said Russians are taking civilians captive in northern Vovchansk. “We know of the first cases of executions of civilians by the Russian military,” Klymenko said on his Telegram channel, adding: “In particular, one of the residents of Vovchansk tried to escape on foot, refused to obey the commands of the invaders - the Russians killed him.” Police investigators had opened a criminal case on the grounds of violations of rules of war, he said, adding that evacuations were underway in that area until Thursday. CNN is unable to independently verify Bolvinov’s claims and has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry for comment. Russia has not commented on its troops using civilians as human shields or targeting those trying to evacuate. Russian forces launched airstrikes on Kharkiv Friday, killing at least three people and injuring 28, mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a Telegram post. Oleh Syniehubov, head of Kharkiv regional military administration, said in a Telegram post on Friday that the district was hit twice by guided aerial bombs. Nearly 10,000 people have beeen evacuated in the Kharkiv region due to Russia’s renewed offensive, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said in a Telegram update on Saturday morning. The evacuations took place over seven days following Russia’s surprise cross-border offensive into northern Ukraine, which began on the morning of May 10. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky last week postponed all upcoming international visits as the country grapples with the new offensive. In an interview with news agency AFP aired on Friday, Zelensky said the Russian offensive in Kharkiv region is “not stabilized, it is controlled.” He said Ukrainian forces are controlling Russian troops’ entry routes into the region but that the Russian operation continues. He also said there may be several waves of Russian attacks on the region, and emphasized the need for Patriot missile systems to push Russian troops out of Kharkiv. The United States announced last week a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons."

Ahead of expected peace talks in Switzerland next month, Xi has called for negotiations that take both sides’ positions into account. Engaging global players like China is crucial because “they have influence on Russia, and the more such countries we have on our side… the more Russia will have to move and [more countries] to reckon with,” Zelensky said. Noting the assurances he says Xi gave him over the phone about territorial integrity, he added: “They support, but what they will do, we are yet to see.” The only known phone call between Zelensky and the Chinese leader was in April last year. Zelensky said he would like to see China at the international talks in Switzerland next month, aimed at paving the way for a peace process in Ukraine. The summit has drawn delegations from more than 50 countries so far, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Swiss President Viola Amherd.

Russia has not been represented at any of the four rounds of closed-door international peace talks that have taken place so far, and will not be at this one. China has attended one, hosted by its increasingly close strategic partner Saudi Arabia. During a recent six-day trip to Europe, Xi pushed back against allegations that his country has been supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying China “oppose[s] using the Ukraine crisis to shed responsibility or defame a third country and provoke a new Cold War.” But he joined French President Emmanuel Macron in calling for a global Olympic truce, which would see a pause in fighting in all conflicts during the upcoming Summer Games in Paris. Zelensky, however, expressed skepticism about the ceasefire proposal, citing inadequate guarantees against Russian advances. “Even if we imagine that there is some kind of Olympic truce for two weeks and everyone is standing still, tell me, I told Emmanuel, who can guarantee that Russia will not use this time to bring its forces to our territory,” Zelensky told AFP. “There is a risk that while we are not fighting them back and not stopping them with artillery fire, even (in the areas) where they are advancing, there is a risk of them bringing more heavy military equipment to our territory.”"

Murphy,Ukraine,"CNN — Satellite images exclusively obtained by CNN show three destroyed Russian jets and damaged buildings at Belbek airbase in occupied port city of Sevastopol on Wednesday. The hardware losses come after two days of attacks by the Ukrainians on Sevastopol in Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. In images taken by US real-time space-based intelligence company BlackSky and space technology firm Maxar, two jets can be seen burned out on the main flight line at Belbek, in addition to a third parked on a protective embankment. The satellite images also show a destroyed building nearby and another which has taken significant damage. Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, said on Telegram Friday that the Russians “successfully repelled a massive enemy attack on Sevastopol.” Razvozhaev said “dozens” of unmanned aerial vehicles and “more than five sea drones were destroyed.” The city suffered a partial power outage due to drone debris falling on a power substation, he added. The attack is the second time Belbek was targeted by the Ukrainians in the last 48 hours. When questioned about a possible Ukrainian strike on Belbek, Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian army’s South, said on Thursday, “We cannot announce any details at this time because there is no verified information at this time.” CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for an update.

Satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies An insurgent Ukrainian group in Crimea, Atesh, claimed on Telegram after the second strike that an artillery warehouse at Belbek airfield was damaged. “Significant damage to the airfield infrastructure as a result of secondary detonation was also recorded,” it said. But none of the satellite images seen by CNN showed any signs that a missile or artillery weapons warehouse was hit, or that secondary detonations occurred. While Moscow appears to have the upper hand in its ground campaign more recently, Kyiv’s forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, in either missile strikes or sea drone attacks. In March, Ukraine says it hit two Russian naval vessels , along with a communications center and several other facilities belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, in a huge overnight attack. Ukraine said the vessels hit were two amphibious landing ships, the Yamal and the Azov. More than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own, technological innovation , audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea. In October last year, satellite imagery indicated that Russia relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks.

The offensive is the most serious cross-border ground assault since Ukraine recaptured the Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. It comes as Ukrainians struggle with thinly stretched forces, artillery and inadequate air defenses as it awaits much-needed ammunition and weapons pledged as part of a long-delayed $2 billion US military financing package. Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages close to the border since the start of Moscow’s push. The town of Vovchansk, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is the scene of some of the most intense battles.

Gen.

He described an “extremely difficult” outlook for Kyiv’s troops on the ground, where “we are strengthening our units.” It comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday and the two pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in a stark show of their growing alignment.

For the Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk, they’re getting worse. Every street seems aflame. The shelling is constant. Torn up tanks and Humvees litter its streets. Small arms fire can be heard as Russian forces inch forwards. Locals in the town lived through occupation and liberation for seven grueling months in 2022. But now they bear the brunt of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s race to grab as much land as he can before Ukraine eventually feels the benefit of US weapons arriving. Moscow on Friday launched its most surprising operation since the initial invasion, crossing Ukraine’s northern border, in a repeat attempt to push south towards the country’s second most-populous city. The devastating weight of the offensive has torn Vovchansk up. The Russian military claims the action has left close to a dozen villages under its control. Most consequentially, Kyiv is now scrambling to send forces from other over-stretched frontlines where Russia is also seeing progress, to stop Moscow’s guns getting in range of Kharkiv city proper. In Vovchansk, the onslaught means that one local man Mykola, his wife, and his 85-year-old mother are for the first time leaving behind the house they built and lived in for 40 years. They were one of 35 groups of residents who called the Ukrainian authorities Thursday and asked to be rescued before Russian troops – now just a few hundred meters to the north – reach their door front. Maria, 85, evacuates the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk. CNN The sounds of artillery shells echoes off the cinderblock walls as a young police officer pulls up outside their house. Mykola walks out, trips on rubble in his yard, and curses. “Hop in!” says the police officer, Maksim, as he hustles the family and their few possessions toward the car. He’s been driving into the town continuously since Russia’s advance, shuttling people out. He moves fast. The smell of burning homes hangs in the air, and smoke clogs out the sunlight – the remnants of the artillery shells that rain down on houses day and night. Mykola and his wife grab plastic bags of eggs, and shuffle across their vegetable patch. The airstrikes last night were just too much, they admit. Less than five minutes later, they’re away, dodging the potholes and rubble that litter the street. At a roundabout on the edge of town, an aging Soviet-era fighter jet, once a proud display of military prowess past, has been knocked off its pedestal. They swerve between the charred body and turret of a Ukrainian tank that’s been blown apart – recently enough that its ammunition spills out onto the street, untouched.

With a wide smile, 85-year-old Maria walks haltingly to an awaiting police van. “It’s not scary,” she says of the shelling. “I just don’t want it.” Her family admits she is hard of hearing, and so the intensity of the bombardment may not have impacted her as much. Yet she still had reached her limit. She sits next to her former neighbor, Inna. “At night, they dropped so many aerial bombs,” she says. “Horrible.” Friends of theirs, who now volunteer to extract residents, tried to reach them the previous day but had to turn back. “They were shooting close to us. Firing at everything,” said Inna. Harrowing memories of Russian control They recall their months under Russian occupation in 2022 – living under the military control of a country they had for decades lived amicably with, mere kilometers away from them across the border. Mykola’s wife said of the occupation: “It was alright. They didn’t touch us. They did touch other residents.” Yet Inna recalls how the Russians sought out Ukrainian soldiers who had fought against Russian forces and their proxies in the first phase of the war in 2014. “They mostly tortured the boys who served. We have a factory there, where they had a prison. The Russians held our boys there.”  There has been widespread reporting of mistreatment of Ukrainian civilians under Russian occupation, allegations the Kremlin has typically dismissed as fake. As soon as they’ve dropped the residents off, the police set off again for Vovchansk. Just past the town entrance, they pull off into a line of trees. Sitting at a picnic table, they examine a map and assess which of the three rescue calls they can answer. Only one group of people requesting their help is accessible, they assess. Yet their debate is interrupted by a low whining noise. Is it a drone? They peer from beneath the tree cover upwards.  The noise comes and goes. But then a drone is spotted – one of three. A larger one that hovers, and two other smaller devices that race around. The two policemen point their weapons at the sky. “Over us!  Look!” one says. “Should I f*** it up?” he asks a colleague. “What if it is ours?” he replies. If the police open fire, they may actually draw the attention of the drone on them. The wait is nerve-shredding. The noise grows. The police and the CNN crew can only hope they are either obscured by the trees, or considered not an important enough target for the Russian drone. It does appear fixated on something else nearby. But then the noise grows louder. It is time to leave."

View more opinion on CNN CNN — It was a carefully choreographed show of force in Beijing Thursday as Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived for yet another meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. They were all smiles . Meanwhile in Europe, the atmosphere could have hardly felt less jovial. Frida Ghitis CNN On Wednesday, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot multiple times and gravely wounded in an assassination attempt . Fico is reportedly out of danger now, with many details about the shooting still unclear. But the dramatic event added to the foreboding sense of crisis across the region; the feeling that, as tense as the situation is, it’s time to prepare urgently, because it might turn much worse. In the 10 days since Putin was sworn in for yet another term — his fifth as Russia’s president — his forces launched a surprise attack on northeastern Ukraine, drawing close to the country’s second largest city, Kharkiv, and capturing several Ukrainian villages. Russia’s lightning assault, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who cancelled all his foreign travel, aims to force Ukraine to stretch its defenses . Tactically, Moscow’s push strengthened its field position ahead of the arrival of promised US weapons to Ukraine. Politically, it comes months before the possible return to power of former President Donald Trump, who has indicated he will not continue President Joe Biden’s level of support for Kyiv. Echoing the alarm among Ukraine’s backers, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron called it an “extremely dangerous moment.” Russia, he said, had effectively “ invaded again .” Adding to the gloom, Europeans watched Putin allies in Georgia, a former Soviet Republic, ignore massive street protests and approve the so-called “ foreign agents ” bill, which is almost a carbon copy of one used by the Kremlin to crush the pro-democracy opposition. It was a victory for Moscow, and a defeat for the vast majority of Georgians who fervently want their country to join the democratic European Union. Securing victories without going to war is cheaper. That’s why Moscow is meddling in Moldova , another former Soviet Republic hoping to join the European Union, and why there’s mounting evidence of ongoing Russian campaigns to interfere in the many elections playing out in Europe and elsewhere, injecting disinformation and stoking political tensions. Interestingly, the Slovak foreign ministry accused Russia of interfering in the Slovakian elections that brought Fico — a Putin admirer — to power. (Moscow has denied the allegations.) Speaking to the media outside the hospital treating Fico on Wednesday, the country’s interior minister warned that Slovakia stands “on the edge of civil war ” due to political tensions. The minister also described the attack as politically motivated, saying the suspect told law enforcement officers that he disagreed with Fico’s policies.

Radovan Stoklasa/Reuters What started as a Russian invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago has turned into an epochal challenge for Europe. With Russia advancing in Ukraine, this entire region is waking up to the fact that this conflict is about more than the survival of a former Soviet Republic. Every day, the stark reality that what began in Ukraine will change Europe for years to come becomes more inescapable. Earlier this week in Moscow, Putin launched another surprise move, removing long-time Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. He replaced him with Andrey Belousov, a former government official who is an economist and well-versed in “military-industrial complex matters,” according to experts, suggesting that transforming Russia into a full-fledged war economy is now the plan. Now Europe, too, is accelerating its own preparations, not only to support Ukraine, but to defend itself. It wasn’t long ago that Ukraine appeared to have the upper hand, pushing Russia out of territories it invaded. Now all that has changed. Frida Ghitis It wasn’t long ago that Ukraine appeared to have the upper hand, pushing Russia out of territories it invaded. Now all that has changed. When far-right Republicans in the US House of Representatives stalled a package of military aid for a long six months, Russia turned the tide. The aid was approved last month, but it was too late . It will take some time for the aid to arrive, and even then, the imbalance in military supplies will continue. Russia’s militarized economy, under a system that brooks no complaints, with Putin in full control, is not only receiving weaponry from Iran and North Korea and, according to the US, key help from China — which it denies, laughably claiming it is neutral. Russia is also producing three times as much artillery shells as Ukraine’s backers. With Russian forces advancing, and with Putin framing the conflict as one against the West, Europe has launched a large-scale effort to prepare itself for the worst. When historians look back at this moment, they won’t be able to claim that Europe ignored the threat, even if the long post-Cold War decades, as we now know, were marked by excessive optimism about the enduring power of peace and democracy. Norway, which shares a crucial border with Russia in the Arctic , is a member of NATO but not the EU. It just announced a massive 12-year military expansion plan. By 2036, its defense budget will double in size and its army will have triple the number of brigades. In London, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently announced a big defense spending boost to move the country onto “a war footing.” In the Netherlands, where outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte is a favorite to become NATO’s new chief, the defense budget is set to double , from $15.6 billion in 2022 when Russia launched the war — to $31.2 billion by 2029.

Alexander Ryumin/Pool/AFP/Getty Images/File Perhaps most dramatically, French President Emmanuel Macron has refused to rule out sending Western troops into Ukraine. Earlier this month he said the question would legitimately arise if Russia breaks through the front line and Zelensky asks for reinforcements. Macron’s comments have been rejected by European allies who remain afraid of provoking Putin into a direct confrontation. In fact, that fear has become a major constraint for Ukrainian soldiers on the ground: The White House bans Ukraine from striking targets inside Russia with the weapons it provides. According to the Institute for the Study of War, the policy “is severely compromising Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russian offensive operations,” in the Kharkiv region, creating a “sanctuary” for Russia for attacking Ukraine from the border areas. It’s past time to loosen those restrictions. Ukraine should be allowed to defend itself, even if it means striking inside Russian borders. The cost of allowing Putin to subjugate Ukraine is, as is becoming increasingly clear, much too high. Even as it rejects the notion of sending troops to Ukraine, Germany is apparently preparing to reintroduce mandatory military service . A leaked document revealed that Berlin is considering imposing conscription for 18-year-old men and women, a sign that the current crisis has become a turning point in views about national and regional security, with repercussions that will last for years, regardless of how and when this war ends.

Hong Kong CNN — As countries around the world ramped up sanctions on Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became clear that the Russian president still had a powerful friend in Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader, who declared a “no limits” partnership with Russia weeks before the full-scale invasion, set a policy of decrying sanctions and continuing to strengthen ties with Putin. On Thursday, Xi welcomed the Russian president to China for a two-day state visit — their fourth in-person meeting since Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine began. The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together — with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel . The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases of related goods that are consistent with those claims. China has repeatedly defended its trade with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace. Here’s how the two sides have upgraded their ties since February 2022. Sanctions drive economies closer The European Union, the US and many of its allies and others across the world have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications. Despite these efforts to isolate Putin’s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia’s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That followed a contraction in 2022, according to Russian state media. The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with — and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline, greatly expanding trade ties with its northern neighbor. The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade , hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule — a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi. That’s driven China to rank as Russia’s top trade partner, Putin declared last year, with his presidential aide later confirming to Russian state media that the country had surpassed the EU to take that spot . As the EU slashed purchases of Russian fuel and limited exports ranging from high-tech goods to transportation equipment, China bolstered its own exports of industrial and commercial goods to the country, such as vehicles, machinery and home appliances, data and official statements show. Russia has also become China’s main oil supplier, overtaking Saudi Arabia, according to official Chinese trade data. China, however, is not alone in taking advantage of Russia’s need to find new markets for its fuel, with India also among buyers upping imports in the wake of the war. Governments warn against support for Russia’s war effort The wartime surge in trade, and growing purchases of oil, have sparked criticism in the West that China was helping to fund Russia’s war. Western governments and independent analysts also raised alarm that dual-use goods with potential military applications are part of these surging imports. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing’s substantial support for Russia’s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles . In a visit to Beijing late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Chinese leaders that the US and other countries would act if Beijing didn’t move to stem this flow. French President Emmanuel Macron and his European Commission counterpart Ursula von der Leyen also pressed Xi on such supplies during the leader’s state visit to France last week, with Von der Leyen saying after the meeting that “more effort is needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia that find their way to the battlefield.” Beijing has previously slammed the US as making “groundless accusations” over “normal trade and economic exchanges” between China and Russia. But analysts have pointed to nascent, potential signs that China may be seeking to dial down such imports — with China’s monthly exports to Russia declining in both March and April compared with the same periods in 2023, according to official Chinese customs data. Putin and Xi’s high-level friendship Xi and Putin’s relationship has also appeared to strengthen as both leaders consolidated power, rewriting previous term limits in recent years to extend their respective lengthy rules. The war has not changed that dynamic. Putin’s overseas travel has declined since the outbreak of the conflict, but this trip marks his second to China since the invasion and the two leaders’ fourth in-person meeting in that time. Xi has made a single known phone call to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during that period and met US President Joe Biden in person twice on the sidelines of international summits since Biden took office in 2021. Xi and Putin have a history of marking milestones together. This week’s visit is Putin’s symbolic first international trip since starting a fifth term in office following his victory in a tightly controlled election in March. It mirrors Xi’s state visit to Russia in March 2023, which was the Chinese leader’s first overseas trip after starting a norm-shattering third term as president."

A recently downgraded intelligence assessment shared with CNN says that Russia has seized on various recent events to fuel criticism about Zelensky’s abilities and place as Ukraine’s leader, a senior Biden administration official said in an interview. Russia has spread disinformation about Zelensky since before the war started but recent intelligence shows “it’s definitely increasing,” the official said. The escalation of Moscow’s efforts comes as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold the line against a spike in Russian attacks in northeastern Ukraine, but the trend had been growing for months prior and is a reflection of Zelensky’s general “formidability” as a wartime president for over two years, the official argued. “I would actually connect this disinformation effort to President Zelensky’s effectiveness across this conflict in remaining a stable, dedicated and critically important leader of his country,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the intelligence. Russia has highlighted two main areas in this recent disinformation push, the intelligence indicates: Ukraine’s painful withdrawal from the eastern city of Avdiivka and the fact that Ukraine postponed its presidential election scheduled for this Spring due to the war. Russia suffered huge losses of troops to take Avdiivka but their eventual victory underscored Ukraine’s shortage of Western ammunition and its difficulties in defending the 1000km-long front line. Zelensky said the Ukrainian withdrawal was ordered to avoid being surrounded and save his soldiers’ lives. The Russian narrative now being propagated, the official said, was that it was not a strategic Ukrainian decision but “rather to assign other motives,” the official said, without spelling out the Russian messaging. When Russia launched its invasion in late February 2022, Zelensky imposed martial law, which was approved by Ukraine’s parliament. Since then it has regularly been extended and the presidential election that was due to be held this year has been postponed. But Russians have used the delayed election to push an argument that Ukrainians will question Zelensky’s legitimacy, something that has been voiced by President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman. Zelensky had previously rejected the narrative as a “Russian program.” Concerned about impact abroad The US is more concerned about the impact of the disinformation on countries abroad than on Ukrainians’ confidence in Zelensky, the official said. “That’s why we’re briefing our allies and partners about this,” the official said. “We want to make sure that this type of Russian disinformation doesn’t take hold and other countries that might not realize, ‘Oh, of course, they can’t hold elections because they’re in a state of martial law as a consequence of Russia’s war.’” Biden administration officials regularly mention the increased pace of publicly released downgraded intelligence to warn about Russian actions and plans. The administration has also imposed sanctions against individuals and entities connected with Russian disinformation. Both Ukraine and Russia have been involved in disinformation efforts against each other for years. So their impact now is questionable, particularly this far into the war, says Gavin Wilde, a former National Security Council official who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “I am skeptical,” Wilde said, “that all of these narratives are doing much other than merely preaching to the already converted.” “[Russia’s] always been trying to besmirch Zelensky and two plus years into this war there’s probably not a lot of fence sitters who are kind of left to be swayed by a nudge to the left or right about Zelensky holding elections or Ukrainian forces holding on Avdiivka,” he added. Which Russian security agency is behind these efforts is unclear, but US officials believe that its intelligence services are involved while also noting that a lot of Russian disinformation often comes bottom up from pro-Russian non-official groups. “Russia is using its typical platforms, both traditional and state media, intelligence services and the proxies that they seek to operate, and social media to spread this messaging,” said the official. Ukraine is facing a dire moment in which its forces are diminished and stretched thin while desperately needed Western military aid isn’t arriving as quickly as it is needed. Russian advances are expected to further pull Ukrainian troops away from lines they have been defending while Russia’s military industry far outpaces the West’s ability to arm Ukraine will critical artillery ammunition. Still, the US official argued, Russia’s inability to achieve its military objectives has energized its disinformation efforts that the US believes will keep growing. “We view this as a natural evolution, or a logical evolution, in Russia’s tactics,” the senior administration official said.  “Not only have we seen these disinformation efforts increasing but we also expect them to continue to increase.”"

One of the world’s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the difficult situation thousands of miles away back home. Perhaps that’s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis – some even directed at blocks in your hometown. “It’s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,” Mahuchikh tells CNN Sport . “I’m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples’ houses were destroyed. It’s difficult.” That strategy – of trying to shut out Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before she competes – proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September. Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the Paris Olympics in July and August. Video Ad Feedback Ukrainian high jumper pursuing Olympic gold against backdrop of war 05:09 - Source: CNN She’s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life. “I live in a suitcase, really,” says Mahuchikh, “because with traveling, we don’t have a hometown.” Her family – her mother and sister – have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That’s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city. “My father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it’s life right now, we live in this way,” she explains. “And they continue their life. My father sometimes says, ‘Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it’s okay, it’s my life, maybe it’s God saying that it’s finished.’ And I say, ‘Oh my gosh, father, please – go to the basement.’” Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting apartment blocks and medical facilities in the city. In August last year, Ukraine’s War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General’s Office said that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded. Yet even as fighting rages on, Mahuchikh still longs for the familiarity of being back home with her family and friends. “If I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,” she says. “But I have some goals and I’m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it’s my goal and it’s my mission, I think.” After consecutive silver medals in 2019 and 2022, Mahuchikh celebrates finally winning gold at the 2023 world championships. Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters Russia’s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh’s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – at last year’s world championships and is supporting fundraising efforts to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine. She also hopes that competing at high-profile events and winning gold medals will provide her with a platform from which to highlight her country’s plight. “I feel that I am an ambassador of Ukraine and I have this possibility to involve a lot of people in this problem that Ukrainian people now have,” says Mahuchikh. “A lot of families are under rocket attack; a lot of children, unfortunately, lost their parents or parents lost their children. It’s so sad, and it’s so sad that a lot of athletes and coaches died in this war. But I want to help my country. It’s the main goal.” According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine’s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), more than 400 Ukrainian athletes have been killed since the start of the war. This year’s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics. In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus , a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint. Mahuchikh competes at the Diamond League meet in Xiamen, China, in 2023. Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country’s military services will be ineligible. However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. World Athletics , the governing body of track and field, has excluded Russian and Belarusians from events “for the foreseeable future,” meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand. It’s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC’s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn’t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country’s “propaganda machine.” Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics’ stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete’s national identity. “When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,” she says, adding that she would find it “difficult” to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus. Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games. However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations.

Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images/European Athletics Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made. Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent “peace in all the world.” A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine’s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country’s first gold medal in the high jump. “Every athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,” says Mahuchikh. “Of course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.” She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend – finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) – the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games. This is where Mahuchikh’s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career – namely Stefka Kostadinova’s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet). The Bulgarian’s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of Karsten Warholm and Mondo Duplantis – both, like her, sponsored by Puma – set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club. “I believe that one day I will jump 2.10,” she says. “I want to be part of this family of world record holders.”"

Blinken’s visit was the first by a Biden administration official since the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country. “I have come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone,” he said during a speech at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. In their meeting Zelensky urged Blinken to provide more military support to the Ukrainian military, including additional air defense support. “We want to get it as soon as possible, and the second point is air defense, the biggest deficit for us. I think the biggest problem is that we really need today two patriots for the Kharkiv region, because there are people – they are under attack, civilians, warriors, everybody – they are under Russian missiles,” he told reporters. Russia is pushing ahead with its new advance into northeastern Ukraine after making several major advances there over the past week – Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured Kharkiv in late summer 2022. Blinken and Zelensky “discussed recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly-arrived U.S. security assistance to helping repel Russian attacks,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a read-out following the meeting. In a Monday evening address, hours before he met Blinken, Zelensky said: “We understand how the enemy is acting and we see the plan to draw our forces back.” Ukrainian firefighters work to extinguish flames at the site of a drone attack on industrial facilities in Kharkiv on May 4. Sergey Bobok/AFP/Getty Images Related article The rest of the world wants the Ukraine war to go away. Putin has other ideas US President Joe Biden signed a $95 billion foreign aid package last month that includes nearly $61 billion for Ukraine, following a successful six-month campaign by the White House to build support in a House GOP conference increasingly resistant to sending more money overseas. Blinken previously admitted that there was a “cost” to the delayed funding for Ukraine. But he focused his speech on what he said was support for Ukraine from “a significant majority of Americans.” “After the delay in approving the latest US assistance package to Ukraine, a delay that left you more vulnerable to Russia’s attacks, some Ukrainians may be wondering whether you can count on America to sustain its commitment,” Blinken said in his speech. “The $60 billion aid package that was approved by our Congress, with overwhelming support across both political parties in both houses of Congress, I think demonstrates that you can.” Before he met Zelensky, Blinken said that US weapons from that recent assistance package had started arriving in Ukraine, and more were on the way to help it succeed on the battlefield with Russia. “We know this is a challenging time,” Blinken said. “But we also know that in the near term, the assistance is now on the way. Some of it already arrived, and more of it will be arriving, and that’s going to make a real difference against the Russian aggression on the battlefield.” He also praised the “extraordinary courage of the Ukrainian people” and said that “we are equally determined that Ukraine stands strongly on its own feet, militarily, economically, democratically, a strong, successful, thriving, free Ukraine is the best possible rebuke to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.” US will help build a ‘force of the future’ Amid Ukrainian setbacks on the battlefield , Blinken praised the country’s resiliance. “There’s one thing that Putin has always underestimated, but that Ukrainians understand to their core, and that’s the fierceness with which free people will defend their right to shape their own destiny,” Blinken said in his speech. Blinken committed to helping Ukraine build its “force of the future” and reiterated that the US intends to make use of seized Russian assets to provide funding to Ukraine for their reconstruction. “Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,” said Blinken during the speech. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.” Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with “Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets.” “The G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,” said Blinken without giving a timeline for when these efforts might be realized. Western leaders have reacted with concern to Russia’s new and unexpected assault in Kharkiv. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an “extremely dangerous” moment in the war, telling Sky News that Russia had effectively “invaded [Ukraine] again.” During his fourth visit to Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion, Blinken also met Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba as well as with civil society and private sector partners. Blinken also used his visit to highlight the need for Ukraine to continue making democratic reforms to maintain its global coalition of support. “Winning on the battlefield will prevent Ukraine from becoming part of Russia; winning the war against corruption will keep Ukraine from becoming like Russia,” he said. It is “important that Ukraine keeps taking the difficult steps to strengthen and consolidate your democracy. Because the choices that you make, the kind of democracy that you build, will determine the strength and the staying power of the coalition by Ukraine’s side,” Blinken said. He called on Ukraine to “root out the scourge of corruption once and for all” and said the US will continue supporting Kyiv’s efforts. “Ukraine’s security is eroded if the resources for its military are siphoned off by individuals looking to enrich themselves. Ukraine’s economic potential is undercut if investors and innovators cannot count on a level playing field. Ukraine’s democracy is weakened if citizens stop believing that they can hold their government accountable and fix the flaws in their system from within,” Blinken said.

US officials acknowledge that the slowdown in US support, due to congressional infighting, has exacerbated a challenging situation for Ukraine. “There is no doubt there has been a cost,” Blinken said over the weekend on CBS. “We’re doing everything we can to rush this assistance out there,” he said. “But it’s a challenging moment.” Some of the supplemental support is already on the front lines, Blinken said. Specifically the US has started to flow in ATACMS missile systems “particularly with an eye towards Russia’s activities right now in Kharkiv,” a senior US official added. “It’s a tough fight. There is no question. But we have a lot of confidence that the Ukrainians will increasingly be effective in pushing the Russians back as our assistance flows in both from the United States and other allies and partners,” the official said. Russian forces have made advances south into Ukrainian villages in the Kharkiv region, after launching their surprise cross-border assault four days ago. One of the main Russian efforts appears targeted on Lyptsi, described by one Ukrainian military blogger as “a very important village” due to its position on Ukraine’s second defensive line. The intention behind Russia’s new push, which began in the early hours of Friday morning, is unclear; it may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south – a rationale Zelensky offered in a Sunday evening address. Officials have told CNN there will be a lag time between the approval of the billions earmarked for Ukraine in the aid bill and the arrival of the majority of the assistance that will make a significant difference on the front lines. Those officials said Western intelligence believes Russia is seeking to exploit that gap in delivery time to further step-up air and ground attacks on Ukraine in what it sees as a “window of opportunity.” The Russian Defense Ministry is pictured March 1, 2023, in Moscow, Russia. Getty Images Related article Ukraine warns northern front has ‘significantly worsened’ as Russia claims capture of several villages State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a news briefing Monday the US anticipates Russia will “press forward” in Kharkiv, and that while Russia may “make further advances in the coming weeks,” the US does not “anticipate any major breakthroughs.” “Over time, the additional influx of US assistance and continued support from partners will enable Ukraine to continue to withstand this kind of aggression,” Patel said. US officials have looked to find ways to quickly provide vital military supplies to Ukraine from the aid package, utilizing the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which pulls equipment from existing US stocks. Just moments after Biden signed the aid bill last month, the US announced a $1 billion PDA package, with the president saying at the time that shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin “in the next few hours.” And on Friday, the US announced another PDA package worth $400 million and a $30 million sale of HIMARS, a rocket launcher that Kyiv’s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday that the administration would announce a third PDA package in the coming days, “to really accelerate the tempo of the deliveries.” “The delay put Ukraine in a hole and we’re trying to help them to get out of that hole as rapidly as possible,” Sullivan said.

Still, senior US officials are currently unsure if it has made a final decision to carry out such a move in direct defiance of President Joe Biden, two senior administration officials told CNN. The White House believes an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah would be a mistake and is “urgently” working to help Israel and Hamas reach a ceasefire deal and secure the release of hostages.

Putin has other ideas,The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”,"May 14, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Nick Paton Walsh,Ukraine,"CNN — The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.” You rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline. Moscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead . First, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk , Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend. The town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers, and from there Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping back with the ease with which they were swept out. And secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.

Here’s why Then there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice. Moving slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure – a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv’s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly further south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub – Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk. And then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat – one of the minimal gains from Kyiv’s stymied summer counteroffensive last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity. An evacuee arrives by bus at an evacuation point in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, on May 12. Roman Pilpey/AFP/Getty Images Ukraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be that Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer. Kyiv’s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden administration officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away – side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East – exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security.

An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul. The opposite is happening in the West, where the congressional dysfunction pausing that paused the US’s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine’s military effort. Its forces are losing now because of that six-month delay in ammunition reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering ahead of the US elections in November just when Kyiv needs American certainty most. The news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything seen since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad the situation is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not."

Here’s why","Russian President Vladimir Putin’s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty, as Sergei Shoigu is dropped as chief of defense.","May 13, 2024",2024-10-13 13:35:14.878622,Ukraine War,Nathan Hodge,Ukraine,"CNN — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country’s defense ministry with someone widely seen as a competent technocrat. That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry of Defense from Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012. Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia’s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia’s economy. “Putin’s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,” Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X . “Belousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.” Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia.

Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition: NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly three times more artillery shells per year than the US and Europe for Ukraine. Having a competent economic manager at the top of the defense ministry can be an asset for Putin, especially when the US Congress has finally turned on the taps of more military aid to Ukraine and as Russia presses forward with a new advance along Ukraine’s northeastern border. Whether that advance represents a new front for Russia or an effort to divert Ukrainian forces remains unclear, but it puts more pressure on Kyiv as its allies rush to deliver more weaponry. The appointment of Belousov could also represent house-cleaning at the Ministry of Defense. In recent weeks, the ministry has been hit by a corruption scandal that led to the sacking and arrest of a former deputy to Shoigu. A game of musical chairs Prokopenko, who is one of the most perceptive observers of the Russian economy, described Belousov as “well-versed in military-industrial complex matters” in her thread on X, adding that he “embodies Stolypin-esque statesmanship,” a reference to the reformist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who led an effort to overhaul and modernize Russia’s inefficient economy after its humiliating military defeat by Japan in 1905. But the reality may be more complex. Putin has shifted Shoigu sideways to a post as the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, meaning that Shoigu is not completely out of the picture. Discussing Shoigu’s new appointment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the former defense minister would remain immersed in matters of military production. But competent management of the wartime economy is now key: Peskov noted that defense spending is approaching 7% of Russian GDP, close to the level seen in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when military priorities and central planning strangled the consumer economy and stifled technological innovation. Ukrainian firefighters work to extinguish flames at the site of a drone attack on industrial facilities in Kharkiv on May 4. Sergey Bobok/AFP/Getty Images Related article The rest of the world wants the Ukraine war to go away. Putin has other ideas “Today on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,” Peskov said in a call with reporters Sunday. “And therefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.” The appointment of a civilian to the defense ministry, then, does not signal a less hawkish approach to the war in Ukraine. General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia’s General Staff and one of the architects of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, remains in place. The top echelons of power remain committed to Putin’s brand of personalistic rule — and Putin’s goal of subjugating Ukraine. Nevertheless, the newest government shakeup does hint at a potential future power struggle among Russia’s elite. With Shoigu’s new appointment, Nikolai Patrushev, the previous Secretary of the Security Council, was relieved of his position and is “due to a transfer to another job,” according to Peskov. Patrushev represents a class known as the siloviki — the men of power who graduated from the ranks of the Soviet security services. A former head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Patrushev has been one of the more hardline members of Putin’s inner circle. And the Patrushev family name has often come up in speculation about who may be next in line to the throne after Putin dies — because, as the Russian president begins a fifth term of office, smart money has him staying on as president-for-life. Putin has no clear successor (if he dies or is incapacitated while in office, his duties will be assumed temporarily by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin), but Kremlin-watchers keep a running list of potential aspirants for a successor. Dmitry Patrushev, the son of the former security council chief, is sometimes described as one of the “princelings” who are waiting; the younger Patrushev was just made a deputy prime minister in the latest reshuffle. Despite the changes at the top, there is no sense that the overall goals of the Kremlin — pursuing the war on Ukraine and continuing a confrontation with the West — have changed. “Putin’s primary objective is to enhance the state’s capacity to support military needs more effectively, while most elements of the existing ‘structure’ will stay intact,” wrote political observer Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder and CEO of the analytical group R.Politik, on X. So the music may be spinning faster inside the Kremlin, but the same loyal contenders are playing musical chairs."

A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia’s progress was not yet “significant” but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an “extremely dangerous moment,” adding that Russia had effectively “invaded [Ukraine] again.” The precise goal of Russia’s new push – which began in the early hours of Friday morning – is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south – which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address. “The idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians’ ability to defend ourselves,” he said. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city. A Ukrainian military blogger, Myroshnykov, said Sunday afternoon that Russian troops had now pushed south and entered the town of Vovchansk, though the pace of advance there had slowed in the face of Ukraine’s defending forces. Myroshnykov went on to predict an attempt by Russia to make its numerical advantage count and throw large numbers of infantry soldiers into the battle. Residents from Vovchansk and nearby villages wait for buses amid an evacuation to Kharkiv on Friday. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters Related article With a surprise cross-border attack, Russia ruthlessly exposes Ukraine’s weaknesses “They will try to seize the area with a lot of cannon fodder,” he wrote on his Telegram channel, referencing previous Russian offensives which reports suggest have resulted in many Russian troops killed. A Ukrainian military spokesman later denied reports Russian forces were inside Vovchansk, saying Ukraine’s armed forces had succeeded in keeping them at bay. Ahead of any stepped-up Russian actions, Ukrainian officials have been evacuating hundreds of local residents to safety. An idea of the destruction being wrought on the town and surrounding villages came from regional Ukrainian leader, Oleh Syniehubov, who said Saturday that Russia had dropped more than 20 huge glide bombs on the area in under two days. These bombs have a minimum weight of 250 kgs, but can go up to 1,500 kgs, and are among the most destructive mass-produced devices currently used by Russia in the war. They have previously been used as a precursor to a major attempt to seize ground. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s army chief, told readers of his social media channels on Sunday that defensive operations were ongoing and that battlefield conditions were difficult. “This week, the situation in Kharkiv Oblast has significantly worsened. Currently, there are ongoing battles in the border areas along the state border with the Russian Federation,” he wrote on Telegram. Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, insisted control over the border villages was still contested rather than ceded, however the influential DeepStateMap group – a Ukrainian organisation monitoring developments on the battlefield – showed seven Ukrainian villages under either full or partial Russian control. So far, Russian gains are not sufficient to put its big artillery pieces within range of Kharkiv city, but residents there admit the situation is frightening. One woman, Anna Ivanova, speaking to Reuters, said: “Of course it is scary, we keep on monitoring the situation, following the news but we remain home and are not planning to go anywhere. All depends on what happens.” Another Kharkiv resident, Olena Pidhirna, said: “Despite all those attacks, air raid alarms, we live normal lives, everyone keeps going out, playing, going to school, enjoying themselves, working. Life goes on, as normal.” Video Ad Feedback Ukraine says it destroyed a Russian stronghold inside Russia's Belgorod region 02:43 - Source: CNN It is not just in Ukraine’s north that Kyiv’s armed forces are losing ground. DeepStateMap also shows Russia making further gains in two other key areas, most notably towards the town of Chasiv Yar, which has become an important forward military position, and further south in the industrial town of Krasnohorivka, where Russian troops are now in control of the town’s main facility, a brick factory. Meanwhile, Russian authorities say eight people are known to have died in an explosion in a residential building in Belgorod. CCTV video of the blast shows a huge plume of dark grey smoke emerging from one of the building’s lower floors, before part of the building collapses on itself. Russian television later broadcast video of rescuers at work looking for survivors among the rubble. Russian officials said the blast was caused by a Ukrainian missile attack. And in a separate development, a fire briefly broke out at the Volgograd oil refinery, the largest oil refinery in southern Russia, after a Ukrainian drone attack overnight into Sunday, according to the region’s governor. “On the night of May 12, air defense and electronic warfare forces repelled a UAV attack on the territory of the Volgograd region,” Andrey Bocharov said in a post on Telegram. “As a result of the consequences of a UAV crash with subsequent detonation, a fire broke out at the Volgograd Refinery site,” he said. The fire has been extinguished and there were no casualties, he said."

Andrey Belousov, a civilian who served as former first deputy prime minister and specializes in economics, was appointed to the top defense post, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. Peskov tried to downplay the move, but the reshuffle comes amid speculation about infighting at the highest echelons of power. Just last month, one of Shoigu’s long-time protégés at the defense ministry was arrested and charged with corruption. Shoigu was “relieved” of his position by presidential decree, Peskov said, but he will remain an influential part of Putin’s administration as secretary of Russia’s Security Council, replacing Nikolai Patrushev, a former head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who would “transfer to another job.” Shoigu will also become the deputy in Russia’s Military-Industrial Commission, Peskov said, as Putin embarks on a fifth term as president. The timing of Shoigu’s exit is notable, coming off the back of several significant advances by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. Russia has launched its most serious cross-border ground assault since Ukraine recaptured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. There have been several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv amid a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. Shoigu had helmed the country’s defense ministry for 12 years and led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian troops initially caught Kyiv by surprise but were soon beaten back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow’s corruption-riddled military and its willingness to send waves of poorly trained and equipped soldiers into what Ukraine and Russian troops have both dubbed a “meat grinder.” His critics have frequently described Shoigu as remote and out-of-touch with the realities of the conflict. His most forceful critic was the late Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin who accused the Defense Ministry of starving his fighters of resources and bureaucratic incompetence before launching an unsuccessful mutiny last year and dying weeks later in a plane crash. Despite the criticism, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of a helpful official who brings help when it’s needed. He is also a rare outsider in Putin’s original inner circle, which consists mostly of the president’s allies from his St. Petersburg political beginnings and his former KGB colleagues. Shoigu was born and grew up in the remote Siberian republic of Tuva and got into politics through his association with the former president Boris Yeltsin. Rising military spending and need for ‘innovation’ Belousov’s appointment suggests Russia’s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine. Belousov was selected by Putin because of a need for “innovation,” Peskov said in a press call, during which he highlighted the ministry’s rising budget, saying it was approaching levels last seen during the Cold War. “Today on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,” Peskov said. “Therefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.” In a reference to the war in Ukraine, Peskov said that due to “well-known geopolitical circumstances, we are gradually approaching the situation of the mid-80s when the share of expenses for the security bloc in the economy was 7.4%. It’s not critical, but it’s extremely important,” Peskov said. The Russian Defense Ministry is pictured March 1, 2023, in Moscow, Russia. Getty Images Related article Ukraine warns northern front has ‘significantly worsened’ as Russia claims capture of several villages The budget currently amounts to 6.7% of GDP, he said. Peskov highlighted Belousov’s previous leadership experience and economic background. “This is not just a civilian, but a person who very successfully headed the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, for a long time he was aide to the president on economic issues, and was also the first deputy chairman of the government in the previous cabinet of ministers,” Peskov said. Much has been made of Belousov’s civilian status, even though Shoigu himself has limited hands-on experience with the military. He holds a rank of a general as a result of his official roles and has never served in active service. Peskov added that the new appointment did not signal a shift in Russia’s current military system. “As for the military component, this appointment will in no way change the current coordinate systems. The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff [Valery Gerasimov], and he will continue his activities. No changes are currently envisaged in this regard,” he said. In his new role, Shoigu will oversee Russia’s military industrial complex, Peskov said. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of accepting a bribe. Russian Defense Ministry Press Service/AP Related article Russian deputy defense minister dismissed after arrest on corruption charges “He is deeply immersed in this work, he knows very well the pace of production of military-industrial products at specific enterprises and often visits these enterprises,” he said. The news follows the arrest last month of one of Shoigu’s close allies, deputy defense minister Timur Ivanov , who was charged with taking a bribe in what was the country’s highest-profile corruption scandal since Putin launched his full invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Ivanov has been accused of accepting a bribe of 1 million rubles (at least $10,800), according to Russian state media TASS. Former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN in an interview Sunday that Putin’s reshuffle is an “important” and “interesting move.” “The bigger argument coming out of Moscow right now is that Russia is moving toward a war economy,” he said. “They’re on a war footing.” Esper said that “one of the disappointing things about Shoigu’s tenure is we thought the Russian army, at least during my time at the Pentagon, we thought they were professionalizing, that they were modernizing all their equipment, their doctrine, how they train and fight, and we really haven’t seen that on the battlefield.”"

In the first development, Russian soldiers penetrated at least one kilometer towards the town of Vovchansk, a Ukrainian military source told CNN. The aim, the source said, “was to get 10 km deep and create a buffer zone at the border to secure Russian territory from feeling the war.” In an official statement, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Russian soldiers supported by armored vehicles had moved across the border at about 5 a.m. Friday, following a day of stepped-up attacks on the border area with guided aerial bombs and artillery. The statement added that Ukrainian reserve units had been deployed to strengthen defenses in the area. On Saturday, local authorities said more than 20 air glide KAB bombs had been launched at the town and its surrounding settlements. The region’s governor Oleh Syniehubov said two civilians were killed when the bombs hit private houses.

REUTERS/Sofiia Gatilova Sofiia Gatilova/Reuters Related article US announces $400 million military aid package for Ukraine A second Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of frontline developments told CNN that Russian forces had also penetrated 5 kilometers inside Ukraine towards the village of Krasne, which lies about 75 km along the border, west of Vovchansk. The source said the Russian ground assault towards Krasne was carried out by four Russian battalions - about 2,000 men. Ukrainian officials have not given much information about the second Russian push, though Ukraine’s General Staff, in its Friday evening update, did note Russian attacks in the area of Krasne and two neighboring villages. It is also noteworthy that DeepStateMap, a Ukrainian monitoring group which updates frontline developments daily, showed four villages next to each other - including Krasne - in the grey area, representing territory currently contested rather than under full Ukrainian control. DeepStateMap also noted on its Telegram channel that the number of Russian forces deployed in the two cross-border pushes was not enough for a deeper advance into Ukrainian territory, but it also drew attention to the fact Moscow has many more troops positioned along the border - estimated to be around 40,000. Asked about developments, Zelensky did not downplay their seriousness but said Ukraine’s military had been expecting such a move. “Russia launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in [northern Kharkiv region]. Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery,” he told reporters early Friday afternoon.

Now there is a fierce battle in this area […] I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire,” Zelensky said. In an address Saturday evening local time, Zelensky said Ukraine was “strengthening our positions” and adding forces to the Kharkiv region. Residents of border villages have been told to evacuate by authorities. National police posted photos and a video on social media showing officers helping people pack their belongings into police vehicles ahead of being driven to safer locations. A total of 1,775 people have so far been evacuated from Kharkiv region, a day after Russia’s surprise assault, the head of the region’s military administration said Saturday. The developments mark the most serious cross-border ground assault by Russia since Ukraine re-captured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022, after it was first taken by Russia in the opening weeks of its full-scale invasion. It also comes after several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which have knocked out all the city’s power-generating capacity, as well as its sub-stations. Governor Syniehubov insisted the latest Russian ground assaults did not put the city, which lies just 30 km south from the Russian border, under heightened risk. “The enemy group does not pose a threat to Kharkiv city, its forces are only enough for provocations in the northern direction.” However, analysts note that if Russian forces were able to push much further south, that could bring the northern edge of the city within range of Russian artillery, which can fire about 20 km."

            Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced a 24-hour hotline for Kursk region residents who want to evacuate to Ukraine. 
     
        “Due to the possible deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the adjacent territories of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must be ready to receive Russian refugees. Therefore, the Ministry of Reintegration has opened a 24-hour hotline for residents of the Kursk region who need humanitarian aid or want to evacuate to Ukraine,” Vereshchuk posted to Telegram on Wednesday. “Ukraine complies with all norms of international humanitarian law. We will provide the civilians of the Kursk region with the necessary protection and humanitarian support,” she continued.
     
 
            Russian authorities announced a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday for the border village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Kursk Gov. Alexei Smirnov shared the news on Telegram, stating that the regional operational headquarters decided to evacuate residents after the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk. 
     
            Glushkovo is situated about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the Ukrainian border and 117 kilometers (72.7 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk. The evacuation will be coordinated by law enforcement, the Russian military, and local government officials, he said 
     
            It is unclear how many people this evacuation will affect. 
     
            Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets says he is in contact with his Russian counterpart about prisoners of war captured over the last week.
     
            “You have seen the videos of Russian soldiers surrendering. You can see that the Ukrainian Armed Forces, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, take prisoners and ensure the rights of Russian prisoners of war. No one tortures them, no one shoots at them, unlike the Russian Armed Forces,” Lubinets said on Ukrainian television Wednesday.
     
            Lubinets added that prisoners were taken “to special military camps, which Ukraine has established in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.”
     
            He said there had been a “proactive” discussion with his Russian counterpart on the issue of prisoner exchanges.
     
        “At any time, Ukraine is ready to continue exchange processes based on the Geneva Conventions,” Lubinets said. “We have priority categories that we are ready to exchange. First of all, these are the seriously wounded, Ukrainian women and all those who are in captivity,” he said. 
     
 
            Ukraine is distributing humanitarian aid and food to civilians and will open evacuation corridors if asked to do so by the local population, he said.   
     
            Residents evacuated from the southwestern Russian region of Kursk have recounted the fearful moment their locality came under Ukrainian attack. 
     
            Russian emergency ministry released video Wednesday of evacuations carried out in the Lgov and Rylsk districts of the Kursk region. In the video, evacuation workers can be seen assisting elderly residents carrying their belongings onto buses. 
     
            Rylsk lies around 16 miles from the border with Ukraine and has a population of roughly 15,000 whilst Lgov lies around 29 miles from the border and has a population of roughly 17,500. 
     
            An elderly woman named Galina described how Ukrainian forces hit “the houses point blank” in her area, recounting how she luckily managed to escape to a basement for shelter, according to a Reuters translation of the video. 
     
        “I was told: ‘Let’s go, it’s easier to walk on the road.’ And there we saw some military men, communication operators. I walked to them to ask for directions and they said ‘We’ll drive you and help, just show the documents, you know how it is.’ I was scared myself,” Galina added. 
     
 
            Meanwhile, Ukraine has accused Russia of neglecting its civilians in Kursk with the Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko claiming that residents “were abandoned by Russia without the most necessary things.” 
     
            Klymenko said the military was now coordinating with his office regarding “the needs of the locals for drinking water, food, medicines and hygiene kits so that we can organize humanitarian aid as soon as possible.”
     
            Russia hasn’t yet publicly responded to Ukraine’s accusation.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lauded Ukraine’s military for carrying out what he called “precise, timely and effective” strikes on Russian airfields on Wednesday.
     
            Ukraine conducted its “biggest attack” on Russian airfields since the war began, with drones targeting four Russian airfields overnight, a source at the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday. 
     
            Zelensky said Ukrainian drones are working as they should, but he cautioned that there are operations that can’t be done with drones alone. 
     
        “We need other weapons — missile weapons. And we continue to work with our partners on long-range solutions for Ukraine,” he said. 
     
 
Remember: Western allies of Ukraine have been reluctant to supply Kyiv with long-range missiles that can penetrate deep into Russian territory. 
     
            CNN has uncovered online job vacancies for trench diggers in Russia’s Kursk region, as satellite imagery shows a new trench system has been dug in the region. 
     
            “Friends, they asked me to publish this announcement from Kurchatov,” said one user in a group called Typical Lgov on the Russian social media website Vkontakte. Kurchakov is a nearby town adjacent to the Kursk nuclear power plant.
     
        “We need people to dig trenches in Lgov. They also have equipment but no drivers. Payment every week,” it added. 
     
 
            Meanwhile, a construction company in the distant region of Bashkortostan posted a job listing on the website Avito, announcing that workers are needed for digging trenches in Kursk region. It said workers would be paid between $1,600 to $4,000 a month. 
     
            “We provide: Three meals a day; All necessary tools; Work clothes; Transportation to the place of work at the expense of the company,” the advertisement said.
     
            Satellite images from the last two days show a sizable trench has been dug across the countryside near the city of Lgov in Russia’s Kursk region — in what is apparently a new defensive precaution on the part of Russian authorities as a Ukrainian military cross-border incursion continues into a second week.
     
            Four images, provided to CNN by satellite imagery provider Maxar, show different sections of a trench dug near the town of Selektsionnyi, which is a few kilometers to the west of Lgov.
     
            Lgov is some 60 kilometers (about 37 miles) from the Ukrainian border by road, and about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from what is thought to be the deepest penetration of Ukrainian troops.
     
            The trench appears to have been dug close to a major highway and rail line.
     
            Ukrainian officials have been expanding on what they see as a “buffer zone” inside Russia, which they say will protect better communities in northern Ukraine.
     
            Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said Wednesday that during “this summer alone, the Russians launched more than 2,000 strikes on the territory of Sumy region. They used missiles, artillery, UAVs, attack drones, and mortars.”
     
            Klymenko said more than 20,000 people had been evacuated. Sumy shares a long border with Russian territory. 
     
        “The creation of a buffer zone in the Kursk region is a step to protect our border communities from daily enemy attacks,” he said on Telegram.
     
 
            He also said that Russian civilians in parts of the Kursk region now controlled by the Ukrainian military “were abandoned by Russia without the most necessary things.” The Ukrainian military is coordinating with his ministry on “the needs of the locals for drinking water, food, medicines and hygiene kits so that we can organize humanitarian aid as soon as possible…”
     
            Volodymyr Artiukh, the head of Sumy regional military administration, told Ukrainian television Wednesday there had been “an increase in the enemy’s use of aviation in recent days. 
     
        “These are guided aerial bombs, famous for their destructive power. On average, 40 to 60 guided bombs are dropped on our settlements and communities. Therefore, there are great destructions and civilian casualties, wounded and killed,” he added.
     
 
            The Russian defense ministry had previously said that its aviation was attacking Ukrainian reserves in Sumy.
     
            Artiukh said that authorities were enforcing an exclusion zone of 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) from the border. 
     
            “This is done to avoid endangering the civilian population. There are cases when citizens return after leaving,” he said. 
     
            German authorities have issued an international arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man suspected of carrying out the explosions that damaged Nord Stream gas pipelines two years ago.
     
            The explosions left gas billowing from Nord Stream 1 and 2 — two major conduits that transported Russian gas to Europe — and prompted a huge operation to find who was responsible.
     
            The origin of the explosions has been a subject of intense speculation and further stoked political tensions in Europe seven months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Neither of the pipelines were actively transporting gas to Europe at the time of the leaks, though they still held gas under pressure.
     
            A spokesperson for Poland’s Public Prosecutors Office, Anna Adamiak, confirmed Poland had received a warrant from Germany seeking the arrest of a Ukrainian man, named as Volodymyr Z. She added that he had left Poland and was not arrested because he was not on a database of wanted people.
     
            The news comes after three German outlets reported that the man — described as a male diver — along with two other Ukrainian suspects, are believed by German federal prosecutors to have launched an audacious underwater attack on the pipeline from a sailing boat in September 2022.
     
            After a joint investigation, German outlets ARD, Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Wednesday that the arrest warrant for the man had been sent to Poland’s government to approve in June. Germany’s Federal Public Prosecutor General did not comment on the reports when contacted by CNN. Die Zeit reported that the man denied involvement when contacted by the outlet.

            Russia has pulled reserves from key battleground areas in Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea in an effort to hold back Ukrainian advances into Russian territory, a Ukrainian military commander told CNN Wednesday. 
     
            Dymtro Kholod, commander of the “Nightingale” battalion, told a CNN team on the ground in Sumy that the military has “information” suggesting Russian soldiers are being pulled from Zaporizhzhia, Crimea, and Kharkiv to halt Ukraine’s continued advances into Russia’s Kursk region. 
     
        “(The Russians) are now trying to stop our advance; they have pulled in reserves, which has benefited our defense forces in other areas, because it has become easier to work there,” he said. 
     
 
            “Of course, it will be harder for us to advance further, but we will still advance,” he added.
     
            Alongside his unit, Kholod said he joined Ukraine’s forces on day one of their surprise cross-border incursion into Russia and only left the Kursk region on Wednesday. 
     
            Russian troops were shocked by Ukraine’s “rapid advance,” Kholod said, adding, “They were in tactical encounters and willingly surrendered to the defense forces.” 
     
        “They are ready to die for our land for some reason, but for some reason, they are not ready to die for their own land,” he said.
     
 
            Ukrainian Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk said that the operation in Russia’s Kursk region is designed to protect the border regions of Ukraine — primarily the border of the Sumy region, which has seen persistent Russian artillery and missile fire throughout the war.
     
            Vereshchuk said Wednesday that “the Ukrainian Defense Forces are creating a security zone on the territory of the Russian Federation adjacent to the territory of Ukraine.” 
     
        “There are Russian civilians within this zone. They are protected by international humanitarian law, which Ukraine fully complies with,” she said, so the Ukrainian military would “conduct humanitarian operations to support civilians within the mentioned zone” as well as open corridors for civilians to evacuate, either into Ukraine or within Russia.
     
 
            A Ukrainian television report that aired Wednesday showed packages of food and water being distributed to Russian civilians in one neighborhood of the Kursk region that is now under Ukrainian control.
     
            The Russian defense ministry said its forces continue to “repel an attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to invade the territory of the Russian Federation,” one week after a Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region began.
     
            The ministry said Wednesday that the northern group of forces, supported by air and drone strikes, had prevented efforts by Kyiv’s troops to make further advances “deep into Russian territory.” It mentioned small settlements, including Skrylevka and Levshinka, that are some 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) from the border.
     
            Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had advanced 1 to 2 kilometers into the Kursk region.
     
            The Russian ministry published video purporting to show the capture of several Ukrainian soldiers near the town of Martynovka, but CNN is unable to verify the location of the video or the identity of those seen in it.  It claimed the Ukrainians had lost up to 270 servicemen and 16 armored vehicles, publishing video it purported to show the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.
     
            The ministry said that “in the area of ​​Martynovka, two enemy groups on pickups were discovered and destroyed.” Martynovka is a few kilometers northeast of the town of Sudzha, where Ukrainian forces have been present since last Wednesday. Videos geolocated by CNN show a continued Ukrainian military presence in settlements near Sudzha.
     
            The Russian ministry also said its aircraft had carried out strikes on Ukrainian reserves on the other side of the border in Ukraine’s Sumy region. It’s unclear how far Russia is redeploying units from other areas along the front lines to bolster the defense of Kursk, but it does appear to be redirecting reserves.
     
            For its part, the Ukrainian General Staff said that anti-aircraft missiles brought down a Russian Su-34 combat aircraft in the Kursk region on Tuesday night.
     
            Oleh Syniehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional military administration in Ukraine, said he has not seen a withdrawal of Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction.
     
            Russia’s air defenses destroyed 117 “aircraft-type UAVs” and four tactical missiles overnight, its defense ministry said on Wednesday.
     
            Of those unmanned aerial vehicles — also known as drones — 37 of them were destroyed over the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched its surprise cross-border incursion last week. The four missiles were also destroyed in the same region.
     
            More than 35 Ukraine-launched drones were also destroyed over the southwestern region of Voronezh, which borders both Kursk and Belgorod regions, Voronezh Gov. Aleksandr Gusev said in a Telegram post on Wednesday.
     
            There were no casualties from the attack, Gusev said, adding that “several residential and non-residential properties, municipal infrastructure, and vehicles were damaged as a result of the fall of UAV debris.” 
     
            The risk of further drone attacks in the region is “still present,” he added.
     
            Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas claimed Tuesday that Russia was moving its troops from strategically significant territory of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast to the southern Russian region of Kursk, where Kyiv says its forces continue to advance after a surprise cross-border incursion last week.
     
            CNN cannot independently confirm the claim and is reaching out to Moscow for comment.
     
            Kaliningrad is a Russian exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania.
     
            “We are now seeing them redeploying their troops from Kaliningrad to Kursk. We call it the demilitarization of Kaliningrad,” Kasciunas said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a video of the meeting posted on his Telegram account. It’s not clear if Kasciunas provided any evidence to back his claim during the meeting.
     
            The Lithuanian minister called Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk “a good move and a completely new page.”
     
            Ukrainian Ground Forces spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovii told Ukrainian media Tuesday that “some Russian military units” were moved to Kursk from occupied southern Ukraine. Lykhovii caveated, however, that Russia had already amassed “a large number of personnel” in the southern Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia region. 
     
            Russia announced that they would be putting peace talks with Ukraine “on a long pause” after Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region last week.
     
            “With their terrorist actions in the Kursk area Ukraine has, at minimum, put the peace talks track on pause for a long time,” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s special envoy Rodion Miroshnik said at a briefing on Wednesday.
     
            Miroshnik said he thinks Ukraine’s incursion was done “deliberately” to stall negotiations. 
     
            Peace efforts have long floundered. Russia has called on Ukraine to give up four of its  eastern regions, something Kyiv considers unacceptable.
     
            The exact purpose of Ukraine’s attack on Kursk is not known, but there is speculation it could be seeking a stronger hand should negotiations take place. 
     
            A week into Ukraine’s surprise cross-border incursion into Russia, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Moscow does not have the situation under control.
     
            The incursion — the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II — is a major embarrassment for the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to “kick the enemy out” of Russia, but his troops are yet to stop the Ukrainian advance.
     
Here’s what we know:
 
What’s happening? The first reports of Ukrainian troops crossing into Russia’s Kursk region, just north of the Ukrainian border, started to emerge late last Tuesday. But it wasn’t until several days later that Kyiv officially acknowledged its military was operating inside Russia.
     
            It marks a notable change of tactics from Ukraine, which has previously attacked targets inside Russia with drones and missiles, but until last week had not launched any official ground incursions across the border.
     
            By Monday, Kyiv claimed to have control over some 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory. That’s similar to the amount of Ukrainian land Russia managed to seize so far this year.
     
Why is Ukraine doing this? Kyiv is likely trying to achieve several goals: reclaim the initiative and boost the morale of its soldiers while diverting Russia’s attention and embarrassing Putin.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said over the weekend that the incursion was a way to put “pressure on the aggressor.”
     
            It comes after Ukraine has been under increased pressure along the 600-mile front line as Moscow in recent months, even as long-awaited US military aid started to arrive to the front. Moscow’s slow, grinding offensive along the entire front line has been forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive.
     
            The Ukrainian government said it didn’t intend to annex Russia’s territory in the same way Moscow has annexed Crimea and other areas seized from Ukraine.

            Ukraine has conducted its “biggest attack” on Russian airfields since the war began, with drones targeting four Russian airfields overnight, a source at the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday. 
     
            The SBU source told CNN the attack was a joint operation between various arms of the Ukraine’s defense, including the  SBU, Air Force and Special Forces.
     
            The source also said airfields in Russian cities of Voronezh, Kursk, Savasleyka and Borisoglebsk were targeted.
     
            Earlier, the Ukrainian Air Force destroyed a Russian Su-34 fighter jet in the Kursk region, according to a statement by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed he has no intention of annexing the Russian territory, rather that the intention is to destroy Russian positions that are used to launch strikes against Ukraine. 
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s forces are advancing in Russia’s Kursk region by 1 to 2 kilometers (about .6 to 1.2 miles) since the beginning of the day on Wednesday.
     
            “We are advancing in the Kursk region, 1 to 2 kilometers in various areas since the beginning of the day,” Zelensky said in a video call with the Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Wednesday.
     
            Zelensky also said that 100 Russian servicemen have also been captured, adding that this will “accelerate the return of our guys and girls.”
     
            Syrskyi said in the call with Zelensky that the main efforts are concentrated on the Toretsk and Pokrovsk directions to “prevent the enemy from advancing and inflicting maximum losses.”
     
            Earlier, video posted by AFP at the Ukrainian border crossing between Ukraine’s Sumy region and Russia’s Kursk region showed a Ukrainian truck carrying blindfolded men in Russian military uniform traveling away from the Russian border.
     
            CNN has reached out to Ukrainian military on the video.
     
            The governor of Russia’s border area of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, declared a regional emergency on Wednesday after new attacks by Ukrainian forces and as Kyiv claims control of hundreds of square miles of Russian territory. 
     
            “The situation in the Belgorod region continues to be extremely difficult and tense,” Gladkov said in a video message posted Wednesday on his Telegram account. 
     
            The declaration comes after Belgorod began evacuations on Monday as a result of Ukrainian advances, following Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion into the neighboring Kursk region last week.
     
            Gladkov said regional authorities are appealing to the Russian government to declare a federal emergency.
     
            Two locations in the Belgorod region were attacked by Ukrainian forces using drones, the governor said Wednesday. There were no casualties in the attacks, which were on the city of Shebekino and village of Ustinka, but two residences were damaged, according to Gladkov.
     
            Ukraine has claimed control of hundreds of square miles of Russian territory, with Russian President Vladimir Putin vowing on Monday to “kick the enemy out” after it emerged that dozens of Russian villages were under Ukrainian control.
     
            Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed Kyiv’s forces have taken control of over 40 square kilometers (over 15 square miles) inside Russia’s southwestern Kursk region in the past 24 hours.
     
            “The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue operation on the territory of the Kursk region. Today, our troops advanced in separate directions from 1 to 3 kilometers,” Syrskyi said in a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday.  
     
            “Control over 40 square kilometers of the territory was taken,” he added.
     
            Syrskyi reiterated what Zelensky had said, that 74 settlements are now under Ukrainian control, with battles being fought along the entire front line.
     
        “The situation, despite the high intensity of hostilities, is under control, we continue the operation,” he said. 
     
 
            On Monday, Syrskyi said the country’s forces control about 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory in Kursk.

            There was a large mingling of the freed Americans, their families and officials, including US hostage envoy Roger Carstens, in a large aircraft hangar at the joint base in San Antonio.
     
            Carstens flew with the returnees and their families from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to Texas. The group posed for photos, including with the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag.
     
            “This is us down here. Those last three, that’s us,” Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who was detained in Russian prisons for nearly six years, said, pointing at the tally marks on the flag.  
     
        “So great to welcome you here at the joint base,” Carstens told the group. “The next phase of your journey begins now.”
     
 
            An official explained the next steps, including medical ones. He said they should “get some rest and recuperation.”
     
            Whelan spoke at the base, at one point holding up a box with an iPad, saying that Russia’s Federal Security Service stole his “iPad and iPhone, so this is a replacement so I can be normal again.” He also appeared to hold a bag with a bottle of alcohol, joking that that was for “medicinal purposes.”
     
            He confirmed he was wearing the flag lapel pin given to him by President Joe Biden, saying it was a “keepsake.”
     
            “It didn’t feel real until we were flying over England,” he said, noting his British citizenship. “As we came over England and I looked down, that’s when it became real.”
     
        “Getting off the plane and seeing the president, the vice president, that was nice. It was a good homecoming,” Whelan said. “I’m looking forward to seeing my family down here and recuperating from five years, seven months, five days of just absolute nonsense from the Russian government.”
     
 
            Whelan credited his family’s “harsh words” with the government on “having to keep them accountable for taking care of us.”
     
            Whelan also expressed gratitude to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Carstens and his team, and “other government agencies you’ll find out about.” 
     
            The other returnees did not speak to the press. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva also landed in the United States on Thursday. 
     
            American journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan were among the 24 detainees released Thursday as part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations.
     
            A host of Russian dissidents were also freed while in return Moscow got a former FSB colonel convicted of murder as well as several individuals accused of spying or cybercrime.
     
Here’s who was part of the prisoner swap:
 
            President Joe Biden posted a video to his X account late Thursday of the Oval Office call between former US Marine Paul Whelan, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and their families, capturing the emotional moment when families first learned there relatives were released from Russian custody in the largest prisoner exchange since the Cold War.  
     
            “They’re on a bus. They’re heading to the airport. Once they get on the plane, we’re going to call them. And you’re going to hear them all,” Biden can be seen telling family members in the Oval Office.
     
            “I’ll tell you what, I’m not as good as your families are feeling. They’re all standing around the Oval Office desk here and we just want to say how overwhelmed we are. You’ve been wrongfully detained for a long time and we’re glad you’re home,” the president told the newly released detainees, before handing the phone over to individual family members to greet their relatives. 
     
            Biden offered a special shoutout to Elizabeth Whelan, who he joked has “lived in the Oval Office.” 
     
            “Paul, it’s incredible, absolutely incredible this moment. And I just want you to know, the whole family is standing by,” she told her brother. 
     
            And Vladimir Kara-Murza, a green-card holder also released in Thursday’s exchange, offered an emotional thank you to the president for negotiating his release.
     
            “No word is strong enough about this, I was sure I was going to die in prison, because I don’t believe what’s happening,” he told the president. “I still think it’s a—I still think I’m sleeping in my prison cell in Omsk instead of hearing your voice. But I just want you to know that you’ve done a wonderful thing by saving so many people. I think there are 16 of us on a plane. Again, I still can’t believe it’s happening. So I just wanted to say that I don’t think that there are many things more important than saving human lives.”  
     
            Press was not invited to capture the moment on camera.

            Former President Donald Trump said the prisoner swap that resulted in Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Whelan and others being released as part of the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since the Cold War was a “win for Putin.”  
     
        “As usual, it was a win for Putin or any other country that deals with us. But we got somebody back. So, I’m never going to be challenging that. It wouldn’t have happened with us, we would have gotten it back,” Trump said in an interview on Fox Business. 
     
 
            He said, “They got a great deal. The Russians made a great deal. I’m not going to be criticizing it, because it’s good to have them home, but they got a phenomenal deal and that sets a very bad precedent. Very, very bad precedent.”
     
            “The deal is very complex, because it just came out. So, nobody understands the deal yet,” Trump said, adding, “And they make it complex so you can’t understand how bad the deal is for us. But we got him back and we could have had him back. We should have had him back a long time ago. It should have never happened. It would have never happened. He shouldn’t have been taken in the first place. And it would have never happened with us if I was president.”
     
            The swap involved 24 detainees and seven countries, and Turkey said it played a mediator role. A host of Russian dissidents were also freed, and Moscow got a convicted Russian assassin who had been jailed in Germany.
     
            In May, former President Donald Trump declared that he was the only person who could obtain the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich from a Russian prison. After President Joe Biden proved the claim wrong on Thursday by securing the release of Gershkovich and others in a multi-country prisoner exchange, Trump posted a series of skeptical questions on social media.
     
            Among other things, Trump wrote: “Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING – and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future. That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse.”
     
Facts First: Trump’s claim that he gave opposing countries “NOTHING” to secure the freedom of American prisoners is false. Though Trump obtained or helped to obtain the release of some Americans held abroad without having to release anyone in return, he also presided over at least four exchanges in which he approved the release of prisoners from US detention in exchange for foreign governments releasing Americans.
 
 
            Biden White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that no money was exchanged and no sanctions were loosened as part of the Thursday deal involving Gershkovich. You can read here about who else was freed in the 24-person swap.
     
            National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby responded to Trump’s criticism on CNN Friday, pointing out that several Americans who were detained in Russia during Trump’s administration, such as Whelan and Trevor Reed, were later freed under Biden. “The previous administration also conducted prisoner exchanges. The previous administration also had to make tough decisions to get Americans home. … That’s what you have to do when you have people in harm’s way over there. You’ve got to make these tough decisions. It’s not easy.”
     
FactCheck.org debunked this Trump claim about his record on securing the release of American prisoners abroad when he previously made it in 2022.

            France welcomed the release of political prisoners in Russia, including Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, according to a statement Friday from the country’s foreign ministry. 
     
        “France shares the emotion of families and allied governments following the liberation of several political prisoners detained in Russia,” the statement read.
     
 
            It also called for the release of those who remain “arbitrarily detained in Russia,” notably French researcher Laurent Vinatier, whose detention was extended by a Moscow court on Wednesday. 
     
            The statement added that France “pays tribute to the women and men who defend freedom of expression and opinion despite the risks involved,” and reiterates France’s “outrage at the death of Alexei Navalny.”
     
            Germany’s government has explained why it took the controversial decision to free Vadim Krasikov, the Russian hitman jailed for murder, in Thursday’s prisoner exchange.
     
            Krasikov, a former high-ranking FSB colonel, was convicted of murdering a former Chechen fighter in a Berlin park in 2019, and was later sentenced to life in a German prison.
     
            In a statement Thursday evening, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said Germany had weighed its “obligation” to keep its citizens safe against the need to help its allies to free “innocent people” detained in Russia, like Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
     
        “The Federal Government did not take this decision lightly. The state’s interest in enforcing the prison sentence of a convicted criminal was offset by the freedom, physical well-being and – in some cases – ultimately the lives of innocent people imprisoned in Russia and those wrongfully imprisoned for political reasons,” Hebestreit said.
     
 
            In a lengthy piece published after Gershkovich was freed, the WSJ reported that the fate of Krasikov was crucial to the deal, and revealed the painstaking efforts to persuade a skeptical German government to agree to release the KGB hitman.
     
            Eventually, the White House agreed to send a formal request to the German government requesting the release of Krasikov as part of the prisoner exchange, a move that gave the German government diplomatic cover, the Journal reported.
     
            A top White House official on Friday rebuked Republican vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, for his comments about the motivation for the historic prisoner swap between the United States and Russia.
     
            The Ohio senator told CNN’s Steve Contorno that he believes President Vladimir Putin agreed to Thursday’s exchange because he was “cleaning house” ahead of a possible Trump administration.
     
        “I don’t know what to say,” White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “There’s absolutely zero evidence at all that this deal was brought about because of some potential fear of who might be the next president. “This deal was brought about because the president had – President Biden had – alliances and partnerships and trust he could build on, particularly with the German chancellor, who had made a brave courageous decision to let Mr. (Vadim) Krasikov go,” a reference to the Russian assassin who was jailed in Germany. “That’s what brought these guys home, was really solid relationships and trust and confidence that the president has built up over years with foreign leaders, and a lot of hard work and some tough decisions by some very strong leaders here in the United States and around the world.”
     
 
            Kirby also responded to former President Donald Trump, who hit the Biden administration for giving too much up in exchange for Thursday’s swap.
     
            “Trevor Reid was taken in the previous administration’s time at office. Mr. Biden got him home. Paul Whelan was taken in the previous administration’s time in office, President Biden got Paul home,” Kirby said. “And I would stress that zero dollars were exchanged in this deal that brought these people home last night, it was all about people to people exchanges. And the last thing I’ll say, Kate, is that the previous administration also conducted prisoner exchanges.”
     
            White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan took a victory lap Friday morning, celebrating the news three Americans arrived home Thursday night after being detained in Russia.
     
        “This was a human victory,” Sullivan told CBS News in an interview. “It was three innocent people coming home to their families reunited with their loved ones, and that’s a magical thing.“But second, it was a victory for our country, because this was the United States of America at its best and working with allies to free our citizens who are unjustly detained abroad and also working to free freedom fighters from Russia – people who have dedicated their lives to democracy and human rights and doing it because we stand for that principle.”
     
 
            Sullivan said Thursday’s prisoner swap, which saw Russia exchange 16 people held in Russian detention, including convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, for eight Russians held by the United States, Norway, Slovenia, and Poland, “says a lot about the different priorities of the United States and our allies on the one hand and Russia on the other hand.”
     
            “These are hard decisions, as the president has said. You have to think hard about who you release in a prisoner exchange, that’s been true for decades,” Sullivan told CBS. “But at the end of the day, the president looked at this deal, and he said what we are getting – the value of human life, the value of putting families back together, the value of standing of freedom of the press, far exceeds what we are giving up by sending a few more criminals back to Russia. So, you make that judgment, you make that determination, and then the president makes the tough call and he’s proud of the call he made here.”
     
            The children of Russian intelligence agents, who were among the detainees released as part of a historic prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations, only discovered their Russian identity on the plane en route to Moscow, the Kremlin said Friday. 
     
            The boy and girl, whose parents are Russian spies Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva who were living undercover in Slovenia, “found out that they were Russian only when the plane took off from Ankara,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists during a daily call. 
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted them on the tarmac in Spanish as they didn’t speak Russian and didn’t even know who Putin was, Peskov said. 
     
        “When the children came down the plane’s steps – they don’t speak Russian – and Putin greeted them in Spanish, he said ‘Buenas noches,’” Peskov said. “They asked their parents yesterday who it was that was meeting them, they didn’t even know who Putin was.”
     
 
            After coming down the plane’s stairs, Doltseva, holding her tears, hugged Putin, who was standing on the red carpet rolled on the tarmac holding bouquets of flowers. Putin kissed Dultseva on the cheek and shoulder, and gave her and her daughter bouquets. 
     
            Putin briefly hugged Dultsev, too, and then the rest of the released Russians, before the group walked together on the red carpet away from the plane. 
     
Some background: Dultsev and Dultseva, who posed as Argentinians, pleaded guilty to espionage in a court in Ljubljana on Wednesday and were sentenced to serve time in prison. 
     
            While living undercover in Slovenia, Dultsev posed as an IT businessman named Ludvig Gish. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced to more than a year and a half in prison, which the court said was equivalent to time spent. He was set to be deported to Russia and was banned from entering Slovenia for five years.
     
            Dultseva posed as an art dealer and gallery owner and went by the name Maria Rosa Mayer Munos. She was also set to be deported. 
     
            During the call with journalists, Peskov also revealed some additional details of prisoner exchange negotiations between Russia and the United States, saying that they were primarily conducted through the FSB and the CIA.
     
            Asked about other Russians detained abroad, Peskov said that “the fate of all our Russians who are held in custody abroad, in the United States, is a matter of constant concern for all our relevant agencies, which will continue the relevant work.”
     
            In late June, CIA officials held a secret meeting with Russian intelligence officers in an undisclosed Middle Eastern capital city to present a proposal for a possible prisoner swap. It was the latest in a series of offers US officials had made to Russia in a yearslong effort to secure the release of Americans imprisoned in Russia.
     
            But this time, the CIA had something new to offer: Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin who’d been convicted of executing a man in broad daylight in Berlin and was serving a life sentence in a German prison.
     
            The proposal the CIA offered to the Russians that day was the culmination of months of work by US officials to convince the Germans to release Krasikov, who’s seen as having close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
     
            The expansive deal presented that day included trading the Russian assassin for two high-profile Americans jailed in Russia on baseless charges of espionage: former US Marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
     
            The Russian officials took the proposal back to Moscow. In early July, in a phone call with CIA Director Bill Burns, the Russian side indicated to the Americans that they agreed to the deal in principle, but the specifics still needed to be hammered out. Then on July 17, Moscow accepted the terms by transmitting their answer to the CIA, setting the stage for the largest prisoner exchange between the US and Russia since the Cold War, one that involved 24 prisoners and seven countries.
     
            It was a remarkably swift conclusion to years of painstaking negotiations between the US and more than half a dozen countries.  
     
Read CNN’s full timeline of the negotiations.
 
            Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who was detained in Russian prisons for nearly six years, said “thank you to everybody” following his arrival to the United States as a freed man.
     
            While proudly displaying an American flag pin given to him by President Joe Biden, Whelan told media gathered at Kelly Field in Texas that his journey to freedom didn’t feel real at first.
     
            “It didn’t feel real until we were flying over England. I’m a British citizen, Irish citizen, Canadian and American. So as we came over England and I looked down, that’s when it became real,” he said. 
     
            Whelan, along with Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, first landed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, DC, following a multi-nation deal to secure their freedom.
     
            The freed Americans traveled to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas, following their brief stop at Joint Base Andrews. 
     
            Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva are now expected to have a medical evaluation at nearby Brooke Army Medical Center.
     
        “I’m looking forward to seeing my family down here and recuperating from five years, seven months, five days of just absolute nonsense from the Russian government,” Whelan said.
     
 
            Whelan also held up a flag honoring hostages and wrongful detainees.
     
            Paul Whelan recalled his experience in Russian detainment began with a “two-week vacation” before Russian authorities grabbed him and claimed he was a spy and a general with the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
     
        “This is the nonsense narrative they came up with. They wouldn’t let it go,” Whelan said. “This is how Putin runs his government. This is how Putin runs his country,” he continued.
     
 
            Whelan joked, “I’m never going back there again.”
     
            Whelan credited his family’s “harsh words” with the government “having to keep them accountable for taking care of us.”
     
            Whelan also expressed gratitude to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens.
     
            “They worked tirelessly,” Whelan said, adding there were a lot of agencies involved and he was “very appreciative of that.”
     
            Former US Marine Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva have arrived at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas.
     
            Following their arrival, they are expected to be transported to nearby Brooke Army Medical Center for medical evaluation.
     
            The three freed Americans who landed at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, DC, on Thursday evening, are now en route to Texas to undergo medical evaluation.
     
            The plane carrying the freed Americans departed Joint Base Andrews at approximately 1:20 a.m. ET, according to a State Department official.
     
            Former US Marine Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are on board with some of their family members as well as State Department personnel.
     
            The flight is expected to last about three hours and will land in San Antonio, Texas. Following their arrival, the three Americans will be taken to Brooke Army Medical Center to undergo medical evaluation and care, a US official told CNN.
     
            CNN earlier reported the evaluations are typical for wrongfully detained Americans who return home, including Brittney Griner.
     
            At least seven Russian oppositions were released as a part of the historic prisoner exchange on Thursday.
     
            Here’s what we know about some of them:
     
Vadim Krasikov, 58
 
Vadim Konoshchenok, 48:
 
Vladislav Klyushin, 43:
 
Roman Valeryevich Seleznev, 40:

We’ve wrapped up our live coverage. Scroll through the posts below to catch up on all the news from Biden and Zelensky’s appearance during the G7 summit.
 
            The United States and Ukraine signed a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday. The deal lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv — but could also be undone by future US administrations, according to officials familiar with its details.
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine. After signing the agreement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden made remarks and answered questions.
     
Here’s what to know:
 
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that the bilateral security pact that Ukraine and the United States signed on Thursday will serve as a bridge to Kyiv’s attempt to join NATO.
     
        “It states that America supports Ukraine’s future membership in NATO and recognizes that our security agreement is a bridge to Ukraine’s membership in NATO,” Zelensky said at a news conference with US President Joe Biden.
     
 
            “It is very important for all Ukrainians and for all Europeans to know that there will be no security deficit in Europe, which tempts the aggressor to war and makes the future uncertain,” he added.
     
            President Joe Biden said that US air defense system support will continue to focus on Ukraine, and that other countries expecting that same support will have to wait.
     
        “We have acquired commitment from five countries, so far, for Patriot batteries and other air defense systems — as well as we’ve let it be known for those countries that are expecting, from us, air defense systems in the future, that they’re going to have to wait. Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries,” Biden said. 
     
 
Some background: The US-made Patriot air defense system that Biden referenced is among the most complex and prized contributions the country has made to Ukraine’s war efforts.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he has received assurances from Chinese leadership that they will not supply weapons to Russia in their war against Ukraine. 
     
            “I had phone conversation with the leader of China, by phone. He said that he will not sell any weapon to Russia,” Zelensky said.
     
            “We’ll see. … If he is respectable person, he will not. Because he gave me (his) word.”
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the United States and leaders like President Joe Biden have supported Ukraine in its war against Russia because of their countries’ shared values — something he says he thinks will continue as the US heads into a presidential election this fall.
     
            “They work based on the voice of their people and it is impossible without people,” Zelensky, who was speaking Ukrainian, said of US leaders.
     
        “I am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents … and it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity within this or that state — and if the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,” he added, according to a realtime translator.
     
 
            Zelensky and Biden are giving remarks after signing a security agreement between their two countries on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday.
     
            The agreement is an “executive agreement,” making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents.
     
            Former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP frontrunner, previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. “Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him “no longer than one day” to settle the war if elected.
     
            US President Joe Biden reaffirmed his support for his son, Hunter Biden, in the first in-person comments the president has made since his son’s conviction on federal gun charges on Tuesday.
     
        “I’m extremely proud of my son Hunter,” the president said. “He has overcome an addiction. He is one of the brightest, most decent men I know.”
     
 
            Biden said he would not pardon his son, restating a commitment he made last week, before Hunter Biden was convicted.
     
            At the end of the news conference, Biden also responded “no” to a shouted question asking whether he would consider commuting his son’s sentence. Hunter Biden has not yet received his sentence.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky marked what he called a “truly historic day” after signing a bilateral security pact between his country and the United States.
     
            “We have signed the strongest agreement within Ukraine and the US since our independence,” the president said at a news conference with US President Joe Biden. The world leaders are gathered for the G7 summit in Italy.
     
            Zelensky said the agreement benefits everyone because Russia is a “real global threat.”
     
        “This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. This is an agreement on cooperation and thus on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace and therefore it benefits everyone in the world,” Zelensky said.
     
 
            The Ukrainian president thanked Biden and Americans listening at home — comments that come after a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine.
     
            US President Joe Biden on Thursday said the US remains steadfast in its support of Ukraine, as he attends the G7 Summit in Italy seeking to shore up American alliances.
     
            Russia’s war, Biden said after signing a long-term security deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, has been a “test for the world.”
     
        “Would we stand with Ukraine?” Biden said. “Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny?”
     
 
            “The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered that question by saying yes we will. We will say it again … we’re going to stand with Ukraine.”
     
            US President Joe Biden addressed reporters after signing a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine on Thursday.    
     
            During a joint news conference on the sidelines of the G7 summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden said the US and other countries signed security agreements so that Ukraine can defend itself now and deter potential attacks in the future. 
     
        “The United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both, not by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition, expanding intelligence-sharing” and training Ukrainian troops, among other efforts, Biden said.
     
 
            US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are speaking in a joint news conference after signing a bilateral security agreement on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Italy.
     
            The deal lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv but could also be undone by future US administrations, according to senior US officials.
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the Group of Seven countries to draw up a clear plan for Ukraine’s recovery after the war.
     
            “We need a clear plan for the recovery, similar to the Marshall Plan for Europe after the war,” Zelensky said, referencing the historic plan between the US and Europe that helped reconstruct the devastated continent after World War II. 
     
        “Friends, let’s draw up such a recovery plan together and confirm it with a joint G7-plus declaration – a recovery declaration,” he said.
     
 
            The Ukrainian president called on the group to agree on a recovery plan “in time for the NATO summit in Washington,” which will take place in early July.
     
            NATO defense ministers are expected to finalize an agreement Friday that will give the alliance greater control over security assistance and training for Ukraine’s military.
     
            Some officials say the agreement is meant to give Europe greater responsibility over the aid amid uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election this fall.
     
            The possibility that former President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of providing US military support to NATO and Europe, could win the election “is a huge part” of why NATO is moving forward with the consolidation plan, said one official familiar with the discussions. 
     
            It is also a way to give Europe more responsibility over the training and equipping of Ukraine, as the extent of the US’ commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia post-November remains unclear, the official said. 
     
            NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the intent in a news conference Thursday, saying NATO provides “more than 99% of all military support to Ukraine … so it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts.” 
     
        He added, “This will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv, and address both immediate and long-term needs.”
     
 
            CNN previously reported the options around ensuring long-term support for Ukraine, which one senior European diplomat described at the time as “future-proofing.”
     
            The announcement comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends the G7 summit in Italy, where he is expected to sign bilateral security agreements with the US and Japan, and speak alongside Biden soon.
     
            The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations.
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.
     
            But the pledge is expected to be an “executive agreement,” the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents.
     
            Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he’d “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” if Europe didn’t increase its defense funding.
     
            The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine’s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said. An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine’s defense.

            President Joe Biden touted a $60 billion investment by the United States in global infrastructure during a roundtable event at the G7 in Italy on Thursday.  
     
            Appearing alongside the other G7 leaders during a roundtable event, Biden spoke mostly off notecards. The president thanked his Italian host, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in particular.
     
            “All told, I’m proud to announce the United States has mobilized more than $60 billion in investments around the world thus far, that’s double where we were last year,” Biden said.
     
            The initiative was launched during the 2022 G7 summit at Schloss Elmau, Germany – a move to better position the US and its allies to compete with China in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.
     
            Greeting Group of Seven leaders in a sumptuous Puglia resort, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni looked happy and at ease. As she hosts the three-day G7 summit, Meloni has every reason to enjoy the moment. Those shaking her hands, however, face uncertainty or impending elections that could toss them from office completely.
     
            Meloni, whose political roots grew from a fascist-inspired party, has none of those concerns. Her Brothers of Italy party resoundingly won last week’s European parliamentary elections in Italy with 28.8% of the vote. This firm standing is making her political kryptonite right now.
     
            Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen – the first to meet Meloni at the G7 – needs the Italian leader to stay out of her way to secure a second presidency. 
     
            US President Joe Biden ­­– who showed up late and looking a trifle out of sorts – faces a big political challenge in November against expected challenger Donald Trump, whose politics are much closer to Meloni’s than Biden’s. 
     
            British Prime Minster Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party is about to be trounced in UK elections on July 4, and French President Emmanuel Macron has called snap parliamentary elections for June 30, following far-right successes in the European vote. 
     
            Japan’s Fumio Kishida is battling a scandal in his own party. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is unpopular in Canada, which will vote by next year at the latest. And German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who fared badly in the EU poll, will also face elections in 2025.
     
            Meloni may well be greeting a radically different set of G7 leaders the next time they all meet.
     
            The Russian foreign ministry has warned that leaders from the Group of Seven countries will face “painful” retaliatory measures following their decision to loan money to Ukraine using profits from frozen Russian investments.
     
            The agreement to provide Ukraine with $50 billion from Russian assets “will not lead the West to anything good,” Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. 
     
            Zakharova called the agreement an “illegal initiative” that “threatens to completely unbalance the financial system and create cataclysmic crises.”
     
            “There is enough European property and money in Russia … and inevitable retaliatory measures will be extremely painful for Brussels,” she said.
     
More on the agreement: The loan will be drawn from funds frozen by Western leaders in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While just $3 billion in frozen funds is located in US banks, a much larger share, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars, is located in banks in Europe.
     
            Negotiators have focused on a loan amount of about $50 billion.
     
            The loan is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024, which would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. President Joe Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election, and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine.

            US President Joe Biden pushed to keep language about reproductive rights in a G7 leaders statement after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document, according to American officials.
     
            Biden worked with other G7 leaders to ensure abortion and reproductive rights remained in the final statement, according to diplomats familiar with the matter.
     
            “The president felt very strongly that we needed to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women’s health and reproductive rights,” a senior US administration official said, referring to last year’s G7 summit in Japan.
     
            In that document, leaders reiterated their support for “access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.”
     
            It also expressed “strong concern about the rollback of women’s and girls’ rights.”
     
Remember: The G7, or Group of Seven, is made up of allied leaders from some of the world’s largest economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US.
     
            President Joe Biden is leading the world’s richest democracies in sending a beefed-up message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West will not forsake Ukraine despite political shocks casting doubts over its commitment.
     
            Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago.
     
            “We will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,” Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. “Ukraine’s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. … The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.”
     
            Yet Biden’s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president’s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe’s security. And the “autocrats of the world” name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill.

            President Joe Biden is not expected to attend Thursday’s dinner for Group of Seven leaders in Italy, the White House said. 
     
            Asked by reporters about the president’s decision aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president will have a “jam-packed two days” and that reporters should not “read too much” into the president’s choice not to attend.
     
            The president arrived in Italy late Wednesday after an almost eight-hour flight, and this week’s summit comes on the heels of a trip to France last week for the anniversary of D-Day and for a state visit in Paris.
     
            It’s at least the fourth time, per CNN’s count, that the president will skip or leave early from an official dinner with other world leaders. In 2022, the president did not attend the G20 dinner in Bali.
     
            In 2023, the president left early from the G7 dinner in Hiroshima and returned to his hotel to receive a briefing from his debt ceiling negotiation team. The president also skipped a NATO summit dinner in Lithuania in 2023.
     
            Biden, the oldest sitting US president, is 81 years old and has faced questions and criticism over whether he is “too old” to run for reelection.
     
            A 59% majority of Americans see both Biden and former President Donald Trump as too old for another term as president, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released earlier this year.
     
            Group of Seven leaders have reached an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, a senior US administration official confirmed Thursday, as the G7 met in Puglia, Italy.
     
        “There was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,” the senior official said.
     
 
            The official added that it’s “only fair that we close the gap by making Russia pay, not our taxpayers, and we found a way to do so that respects the rule of law in every jurisdiction.”
     
            The agreement is the product of years of negotiation complicated by a patchwork of jurisdictional laws that required the direct involvement of President Joe Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, among other top US officials. 
     
What happens next: The leaders will soon issue a joint communiqué on the decision.
     
            It will take some time before Ukraine begins to receive this money, but the US official said the effort would “move with urgency” and the commitment remains “to be ready to disperse $50 billion this calendar year.”
     
            If the loan is dispersed by the end of 2024, it would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election, and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine.
     
            “The next steps are to enshrine the communiqué commitments with the EU 27, the full membership, then we need to write contracts between the lenders … the recipient, which is Ukraine, and the intermediaries,” the official said.
     
            From there, there will be an agreement on a dispersal schedule.
     
            US President Joe Biden arrived to the G7 Summit in Italy armed with a new set of more than 300 sanctions aimed at further isolating and financially weakening Russia more than two years into its offensive in Ukraine.
     
            The measures, the US Department of Treasury said, are “guided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia,” and mark the latest move to limit the Kremlin’s revenues and hamper Moscow’s ability to source materials for its war.
     
            The sanctions take aim at foreign financial institutions supporting Russia’s war, restrict Russia’s access to certain US software and information technology services, and target over 300 individuals and entities “whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanction,” the department said.
     
            The US and Western allies have levied a series of sanctions against Russia in recent years, but Russia has adapted to them. Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken to gloating about Russia’s resistance to international sanctions, which take time to have an effect.
     
        “Today’s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries. We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia’s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia’s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
     
 
            Among the actions is a step that will authorize Treasury to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions aiding Russia’s military-industrial base. The move threatens sanctions on any financial institution that does business with any previously-sanctioned individual or entity, including Sberbank and VTB bank.
     
            US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will participate in a news conference together today in Italy during the G7 summit, according to US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
     
        “On Thursday, President Biden and President Zelensky will sit down to discuss our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future. And following that meeting, both leaders, President Biden and President Zelensky will participate in a news conference,” Kirby said in a gaggle with reporters ahead of the president’s travel.
     
 
            The president apologized to Zelensky last week during a meeting in France for aid delays from the US, telling the Ukrainian leader: “We’re not going to walk away from you.”
     
            Kirby echoed that sentiment ahead of the president’s travel, saying in part that “we will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine’s fight for freedom.” 
     
            Biden is set to meet with other leaders from G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan – at the summit as well.
     
            The White House also confirmed that Pope Francis will attend a special summit on artificial intelligence as part of the larger G7 summit.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the G7 summit earlier on Thursday and was greeted by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
     
            Ahead of his arrival, Zelensky tweeted about the bilateral security agreements with US and Japan that he is expected to sign. 
     
        “Bilateral security agreements will be signed during meetings with US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida,” Zelensky said. 
     
 
More background: The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy, multiple people familiar with the matter have told CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US’ longterm security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations. 
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. 
     
            Also on the table is a $50 billion loan for the Ukraine by G7 members, backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, 
     
CNN’s Natasha Bertrand contributed reporting to this post. 
 
            When the Group of 7 pose for its ritual family photo Thursday on the rocky Adriatic coast of Italy, the image will not be of leaders at the height of their political strength.
 
            Instead, nearly to a person, the leaders assembling at a luxury resort in Puglia find themselves weakened at home by elections, scandal or waning influence. 
     
            Amid the olive trees and swimming pools, the anti-incumbent sentiments coursing through Western democracies are creating extraordinarily high stakes for global geopolitics.
     
            Rarely has the yearly gathering of the world’s leading economies been so overshadowed by the political vulnerabilities of nearly all its members. It raises questions of how effective the “steering committee of the free world,” as US President Joe Biden’s aides have labeled the G7, can actually be amid anger and discontent from their own populations.

Our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war has concluded for today.
 
            President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed recent claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he is no longer Ukraine’s legitimate president in a joint news conference with France’s President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Friday.
     
        “President Zelensky’s legitimacy is recognized by the people of Ukraine only, he is elected by the people of Ukraine. I am very grateful for the support,” he said, referring to himself in the third person. “Our people are free. To be honest, that’s what we are fighting for (freedom). I am grateful for the support. Comrade Putin’s legitimacy is recognized only by comrade Putin himself. Putin elects himself. Russian people are just a decoration, they only have one actor,” Zelensky said, pointing to Putin’s recent win by an overwhelming majority in Russia’s presidential election, the result of which was a foregone conclusion.
     
 
            If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election in Ukraine would have been held in March of 2024 and Zelensky’s first term would have ended in May. Putin’s comments dismissed Ukraine’s Martial Law Act introduced after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 which remains in place and which explicitly bans elections during wartime. 
     
            Zelensky also commented on the upcoming Summit on Peace in Ukraine scheduled for June 15-16 in Switzerland. He called on the world’s leaders to participate in person and show that they “are not afraid” of Russia.
     
        “It is definitely a step toward the end of the war – to show that the whole world is on the side of ending of the war, that the whole world wants it and helps Ukraine as much as possible to bring peace closer. A just peace, it is very important that it must be a just and stable peace, not for an hour, a month or a year, but ideally forever,” the Ukrainian leader said.
     
 
            France will begin training Ukrainian pilots and mechanics on the Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet “in the coming days,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday.
     
            Macron would not give additional details on the number and source of the jets that France plans to send to Ukraine as part of a coalition of partners “out of a concern for efficiency,” he said. The training will take place in France, according to Macron.
     
        “We have always had a way of doing things, giving numbers once the arms are delivered and used, it’s more effective and gives less notice to our enemies,” he added, speaking alongside Ukraine’s president in Paris
     
 
            Pressed for details on whether France will deploy military instructors to Ukraine, he said there were still “no taboos” about doing so. 
     
            “Who would we be to cede to the threats of Russia that will de facto decide that Ukraine has no sovereignty to invite companies or instructors (onto its territory)?” Macron said. 
     
            However, he added that France would send about 20 technical experts from different ministries to Ukraine to help Kyiv’s integration with European Union standards. 
     
            Separately, French-German defense firm KNDS signed two contracts Friday with the Ukrainian government to launch the production of spare parts for French-made CAESAR howitzers and 155mm artillery shells in Ukraine. 
     
            US President Joe Biden made a sweeping pledge for democracy on Friday, against the backdrop of Ukraine’s grinding fight in the face of Russia’s full-scale invasion.
     
            His speech came as Western leaders commemorated the largest operation by Allied forces against Nazi Germany during World War II, drawing parallels between the actions of veterans and Kyiv’s forces on the ground today. 
     
Here are the latest developments:
 
            Russia is not currently supplying weapons to other countries as a retaliatory move to Western weapon deliveries to Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday. But he didn’t rule out sending weapons in the future.
     
        “We are not supplying (weapons) yet, but we reserve the right to do this to those states or even some structures that are experiencing pressure on themselves, including of a military nature, from those countries who supply weapons to Ukraine and call for them to be used against us, against Russian territory,” Putin said. 
     
 
            Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin further justified this stance, questioning, “If they (Western countries) deliver them to a combat zone and call for the use of these weapons, why don’t we have the right to do the same, to respond in a mirror way?”
     
            “I’m also not ready to say that we will do this tomorrow, because any such delivery is associated with a number of circumstances that in one way or another affect certain regions of the world and we must, of course, think about it,” he added.
     
            This statement follows Putin’s earlier warning to Western countries, highlighting the risks of supplying weapons to Ukraine and suggesting such actions could provoke Russia to arm its adversaries.
     
            Ukrainian authorities implemented several measures to reduce electricity consumption, as the country grapples with historic low energy capacity caused by Russian strikes on critical infrastructure.
     
        “To improve the situation in the power system, we are working from two angles at the same time. We are restoring and expanding generation while reducing consumption,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. 
     
 
Limited use of electric trains and air conditioning: Across the country, government and regional administrative offices will halt their use of air conditioning and outdoor lighting at buildings and surrounding areas, according to Shmyhal.
     
            Law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and other government agencies are also encouraged to take similar steps. Local authorities will limit street lighting at night. 
     
            The Ukrainian national railway company Ukrzaliznytsia announced on Thursday it is temporarily changing the schedule of suburban electric trains to save power. Some trains will stop running while others will run less frequently. 
     
By the numbers: Nearly half of Ukraine’s available energy capacity has been damaged or destroyed as a result of Russian attacks, according to the CEO of Ukraine’s power grid operator, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi. The United Nations recorded 24 attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities in May, it said Friday. 
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin said that “all armed conflicts end with certain peace agreements” while speaking at a panel during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. 
     
            The Russian president added that Russia “must seek conditions that would correspond to our interests and would be reliable,” but he did not elaborate on what said condition would be. 
     
            However, he went on to accuse the West of being deceptive in its approach to talks, saying, “they deceive you at every step; they say one thing, do another.”
     
            Putin added that “either on the basis of military defeat, or on the basis of victory, we certainly strive and will achieve victory.” 
     
For context: An international peace summit on Ukraine is scheduled to be held in Switzerland next weekend. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia — with China’s help — last week of attempting to pressure countries not to join the upcoming summit. 
     
            Reuters reported in late May that Moscow was willing to consider peace talks that would freeze the current Russian occupation of about a fifth of Ukraine. Putin responded to that report by suggesting Russia was willing to talk peace, based on earlier agreements. He hinted at an aborted deal in Istanbul, just after the war began in 2022, which fell apart, mostly because Moscow’s forces were still rampaging across Ukrainian territory and massacres around Kyiv had come to light. CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh outlines two reasons why Putin may be talking about peace again.
     
            Even though Russia has “many more” nuclear bombs than the US and Europe, discussions about a possible nuclear war are not necessary, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Friday. 
     
            “There is no need to think about it [nuclear war]. And I would ask anyone to not mention anything like that,” he said at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. 
     
            Putin added that Russian forces are “increasing their effectiveness,” about 27 months into Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s defense industry has increased shell production by 20%, and its forces are “surpassing the capabilities of our enemies” when it comes to aircraft and tanks, he said.
     
Veiled threats: Putin has repeatedly made remarks on the possibility of using nuclear weapons. On Friday, the Russian leader said his country has nuclear weapons that are more powerful than the bombs the Americans dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, “but it won’t come to this.” Russia’s total nuclear stockpile is larger than the United States’, at around 6,250 total nuclear warheads, according to the Arms Control Association. The US has more than 5,500.
     
Legacy of nuclear war: Washington unleashed atomic bombs on both Japanese cities in August 1945, leaving years of destruction and psychological trauma on communities there.
     
            At least 70,000 people were killed in the initial blast in Hiroshima, while approximately 70,000 more died from radiation exposure. The US dropped another bomb on Nagasaki three days later killing up to 80,000 people. 
     
            The US remains the only country to ever use an atomic bomb in war.
     
            During a speech commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day at Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France, US President Joe Biden honored and thanked veterans for their service, while stressing the importance of democracy and issuing a warning against a rising tide of isolationism. 
     
        “When we talk about democracy — American democracy — we often talk about the ideals of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. What we don’t talk about is how hard it is,” Biden said. 
     
 
            Here are highlights from his speech: 
     
            Private First Class John Wardell, born July 1925, came ashore in Normandy on June 16, 1944, shortly after the D-Day invasion. He was just 18.
     
            Wardell served with rangers in the Battle of Brest and was wounded in Germany during the latter stages of the war, the White House said.
     
            In his speech at Pointe du Hoc, US President Joe Biden paid tribute to Wardell, from New Jersey, who was sat in the audience next to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
     
        “John, we love you, man. Thank you for all you’ve done,” Biden said, as the audience applauded. “You deserve that and a lot more, John.”
     
 
            In his closing remarks, US President Joe Biden described his country as “the fortunate heirs of the legacy” of the veterans who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc on D-Day, and vowed to continue their mission.
     
        “My fellow Americans, I refuse to believe — I simply refuse to believe — that America’s greatness is a thing of the past. I still believe there’s nothing beyond our capacity in America when we act together,” Biden said.
     
 
            The line was an indirect shot at Biden’s political rival, former President Donald Trump, whose signature slogan — “Make America Great Again” — and campaign speeches often imply that the country’s best days are behind it and carry the vision of a dark future.
     
            Biden said the veterans are “not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.”
     
        “They’re not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us to care for others and our country more than ourselves. They’re not asking us to do their job, they’re asking us to do our job: to protect freedom in our time. To defend democracy. To stand up to aggression abroad and at home,” he said.
     
 
            US President Joe Biden issued a sharp warning against a rising tide of isolationism in the US, during his speech at Pointe du Hoc.
     
        “We talk about democracy, American democracy. We often talk about the ideals of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. What we don’t talk about is how hard it is,” Biden said, claiming the “most natural instinct is to walk away.”
     
 
            But, pointing to the example of D-Day veterans in the audience, he warned against this instinct.
     
            “They believed America was the beacon of the world. I’m certain they believed that it would be that way forever,” he said.
     
        “Ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things when challenged. There’s no better example of that in the whole world than right here at Pointe du Hoc.”
     
 
            US President Joe Biden suggested that American WW2 veterans would want their country to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression today, just as they opposed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s aggression.
     
            When the Allied forces arrived on the Normandy beaches on D-Day, Biden said a “feared dictator” who had “conquered a continent had finally met his match.”
     
            “Because of them, the war turned. They stood against Hitler’s aggression. Does anyone doubt – does anyone doubt, that they would want America to stand up against Putin’s aggression here in Europe today?” he said.
     
            He asked if anyone thought those Rangers would want America to “go it alone” today.
     
            “They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ’30s and ‘40s. Does anyone believe they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish the hateful ideologies of today?” Biden said.
     
            Throughout the D-Day commemoration events, Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders have drawn parallels between the fight against fascism in the 1930s and the fight against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine today.
     
            US President Joe Biden began his speech by painting a picture in remembrance of the attack of Pointe du Hoc after taking in the site on the 80-year D-Day anniversary in Normandy.
     
            The site of the speech is the scene of one of the most heroic actions on June 6, 1944, as Army Rangers scaled 100-foot cliffs to attack Nazi positions.
     
        “All they could hear was a crack of bullets hitting ships, sand, rocks, hitting everything. All they knew was time was of the essence. They had only 30 minutes. Thirty minutes to eliminate the Nazi guns, high on this cliff – guns that could halt the allied invasion before it even began. But these are American rangers. They were ready,” Biden said. 
     
 
            The White House released excerpts ahead of US President Joe Biden’s expected speech in Normandy, where he is expected to speak on democracy as he marks the 80th anniversary of D-Day at Pointe du Hoc.
     
            “I’ve long said that history has shown that ordinary Americans can do the most extraordinary things. And there’s no better example of that in the entire world than right here at Pointe du Hoc,” an excerpt reads. 
     
            The excerpts show Biden will use the iconic Pointe-du-Hoc site to call on Americans to protect US democracy.
     
        “As we gather here today, it’s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day June 6, 1944. It’s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us. They’re asking us what will we do. They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs. They’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.”
     
 
            Ukraine has documented its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost one year, amid Russia’s sweeping offensive on the northeastern region of Kharkiv.
     
            The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a “significant increase” — at least 31% — in the number of civilians killed in Ukraine in May, compared to April, according to a press release. 
     
Kharkiv offensive: More than half of deaths in May took place in Kharkiv city and the wider region, said the head of HRMMU, Danielle Bell, where Russian forces launched a renewed ground attack on May 10.
     
            Bell attributed the increase of casualties to Russia’s use of “air-dropped bombs and missiles” in populated areas near the frontline and Kharkiv city.
     
            The scale and force of Russia’s assault on Kharkiv prompted the US to allow Kyiv to strike from Kharkiv across the border into Russia, using allied-made weapons.
     
Recent attacks: In the update, the UN monitoring mission highlighted some recent attacks on the Kharkiv area; an attack on a printing house in Kharkiv city on May 21 which killed at least civilians; and a strike on a large home improvement center in Kharkiv city on May 25 that killed 19 civilians. 
     
        Such attacks “highlight the stark vulnerability of civilians engaged in everyday activities, where even routine tasks like buying supplies to repair damaged homes can result in the loss of life and loved ones,” Bell remarked. 
     
 
            US President Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive at Pointe du Hoc, in Normandy in minutes, as Western leaders mark the anniversary of the largest Allied forces’ operation against Nazi Germany in World War II. 
     
        The US leader will draw parallels between the more than 150,000 allies troops who fought for the liberation of Europe from Adolf Hitler’s Nazis on June 6, 1944, and Ukraine’s present fight against Russia’s raging 27-month invasion.
     
 
            “He’ll talk about the stakes of that moment – an existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,” national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters. The speech will attest to the urgency of democracy, invoking the symbolism of the location.
     
            Biden will echo one of his predecessors, Ronald Reagan, who in 1984 traveled to a clifftop 100 feet high known as Pointe du Hoc, which was scaled in a daring raid by US Army Rangers on D-Day. Despite heavy losses, the Rangers seized German artillery pieces that could have caused even greater carnage of the Omaha and Utah invasion beaches.
     
            Reagan stood in front of a stone memorial shaped into the Rangers’ emblem, with his back to the Channel, surrounded by surviving veterans of the raid, and gave one of the greatest presidential speeches. “These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,” Reagan said. He later confessed to his diary that he was so moved it was tough to get the words out.

            US President Joe Biden has apologized to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky for the delay earlier this year in passing a new military aid package, which was held up by Republican opposition in Congress.
     
            Biden made the apology while announcing a new aid package for Ukraine in a bilateral meeting with Zelensky on Friday.
     
            “You know, you haven’t bowed down, you haven’t yielded at all, you continue to fight in a way that is just remarkable, is just remarkable—and we’re not going to walk away from you,” Biden told the Ukrainian president. 
     
        “I apologize for the weeks of not knowing what’s going to pass, in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up, but we got it done.”
     
 
            Biden took the opportunity to tout Friday’s funding announcement, as well as the additional funding surged to Ukraine since he signed the supplemental in April.
     
            “Since then, including today, I’ve announced six packages of significant funding—today I’m also signing an additional package for $225 million to help you reconstruct the electric grid,” he said.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of the return of fascism in Europe, 80 years after D-Day, the Allied invasion of France which laid the foundations for the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
     
        “Unfortunately, we live in a time when Europe is no longer a continent of peace. And at a time when Nazism is unfortunately making a comeback,” Zelensky told the French National Assembly in Paris Friday.
     
 
            Zelensky had joined other world leaders and veterans in marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, northwest France, on Thursday, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rages on.
     
        “Once again in Europe, cities are being completely destroyed and villages are being burnt down. Once again in Europe, filtration and deportation camps are appearing, and hatred, which has become a new Russian cult,” Zelensky told French lawmakers Friday.
     
 
            Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted incredulity and further derailed his floundering general election campaign.
     
            Sunak attended the first part of the commemorative events in Normandy, France, on Thursday, but skipped the international ceremony at Omaha Beach, which was attended by other world leaders and veterans of the Allied operation in 1944.
     
            The UK was represented at the international ceremony by David Cameron, Sunak’s foreign secretary and a former prime minister, who took photographs alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden.
     
            Also in attendance was Labour leader Keir Starmer, who was filmed speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the event. Labour was quick to condemn Sunak’s decision to skip the events, and the gaffe dominated British news coverage of the election on Friday.
     
            Large swaths of Ukraine are facing rolling and emergency blackouts as the country grapples with historic low energy capacity due to Russian strikes targeting critical infrastructure.
     
            Nearly half of Ukraine’s available capacity has been damaged or destroyed, according to Ukrainian power grid operator Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.
     
        “We are dealing with an absolutely unprecedented scale of destruction. And the deficits that we have in the power system now, which are not even covered by the fairly powerful imports that come from Europe to Ukraine, are precisely the result of this destruction,” Kudrytskyi told local media.
     
 
            The destruction means Ukraine is facing a historic low energy generation capacity, he said, and announced electricity consumption limits in all regions of Ukraine.
     
        “The main reason for the restrictions is the consequences of six enemy missile attacks on Ukrainian power plants. Due to significant damage, they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attacks,” he explained.
     
 
            Ukraine has imported energy from neighboring Poland, Romania and Moldova. It has also received emergency assistance from Poland, but Kudrytskyi warned these measures are insufficient.
     
            The United Nations has recorded 24 attacks on energy facilities during the month of May, it said Friday. 
     
            Ukrainian energy authorities have now been forced to carry out blackouts “compounding the difficulties faced by millions of Ukrainians who have now lived through almost 28 months of war,” the UN said.

This post has been updated with the UN’s statement. 
 
            US President Joe Biden is set to present a case for democracy Friday against the backdrop of a key turning point for allied forces in World War II – setting up a dramatic moment with war once more on Europe’s doorstep and teeing up a domestic contrast with his political rival.
     
            Biden will travel to Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France, on Friday – a site separating the Omaha and Utah beaches where American Army Rangers scaled steep cliffs to secure positions against the Germans – for a speech on the power of democracy invoking the symbolism of the location.
     
            The speech will stand out as a call to modern-day action against an isolationist streak seeping into American politics and a rise of authoritarianism around the world.
     
            Eighty years after the allied landings, the president will draw a “throughline” from World War II to today in his remarks, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. But the subtext of the speech is also likely to be aimed at former President Donald Trump.
     
        “He’ll talk about the stakes of that moment – an existential fight between dictatorship and freedom. He’ll talk about the men who scaled those cliffs and how they… put the country ahead of themselves. And he’ll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how if we back dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going, and ultimately, America and the world pays a greater price,” Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky drew parallels between World War II and his country’s battle against Russia in an address to French lawmakers in Paris Friday.  
     
        “Hitler crossed red line after red line, Putin does the same,” he said, adding that Ukrainians were the heirs of the Allied fighters of WW2.
     
 
            His speech was greeted rapturously by the French National Assembly, with lawmakers giving him a standing ovation. In the opening months of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Zelensky addressed the French National Assembly by video.
     
        “France, I thank you for being at our side to defend life,” he said in French.
     
 
            On Thursday, Macron announced that Paris and Kyiv will sign an agreement for France to provide Ukraine with Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets.
     
            Following Thursday’s D-Day commemorations, French President Emmanuel Macron said France will begin supplying Ukraine with Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets.
     
            The delivery program will begin following the signing of an agreement with Ukraine’s president on Friday in Paris, Macron said in an interview with French broadcaster TF1.
     
            The Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet is a multirole jet that been in service for some 25 years, with air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities. The Mirage jet has been successfully exported by France to several countries and broadly offers a similar capacity to the American-made F-16 jet.
     
            Macron said that he proposed to begin training pilots on the aircraft from this summer, with training taking around 6 months. France is already providing basic flight training to Ukrainian pilots as part of the F-16 supply program.
     
            The French leader said that he hoped to build a similar coalition of countries that could provide Ukraine with their own Mirage jets. Both Greece and the UAE have Mirage 2000-5 jets in their air forces.
     
            Russia attacked Ukraine’s critical infrastructure overnight into Friday, targeting at least nine regions including the capital Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said. 
     
            Ukraine’s air defenses shot down 48 out of 53 attack drones launched by Russia and all five cruise missiles launched, Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram. 
     
            They were shot down in the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kyiv and Khmelnytskyi regions, he said.
     
            At least one person died and four injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region; four others were injured in the Kherson region and six others in Dnipropetrovsk, local officials said.
     
            In Kyiv region, a fire broke out at an industrial facility, but there were no casualties and responders are working to try to extinguish the fire, the head of Kyiv region military administration said.
     
            US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky are in France as part of the commemorations for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. 
     
            Biden and Zelensky were among a throng of Western leaders and veterans who attended the commemorations in Normandy on Thursday, but Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited.
     
            Instead, Putin will on Friday speak at the plenary session of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, discussing the state of the Russian economy after 27 months of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
     
            Meanwhile, Zelensky will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and address the National Assembly in Paris, as he seeks to shore up support for his country in its attempts to repel Russia’s invasion.
     
            The war may have entered a new phase this month, after Western countries – including the United States – gave Ukraine permission to use Western weapons to strike inside Russian territory.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping sought to deepen ties across energy, trade and security on Thursday, against a backdrop of political unrest.
     
            Both leaders made specific references to the war in Ukraine, sovereignty in Taiwan and fighting in the Middle East, during Putin’s two-day state visit to Beijing.
     
Here are the latest developments:
 
            Chinese President Xi Jinping had an in-depth exchange of views Thursday on the war in Ukraine with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, according to a statement from China’s foreign ministry. 
     
            During the meeting in Beijing, Xi conveyed China’s support for convening an international peace conference to settle the “Ukraine crisis” and reiterated China’s commitment to continue to play a constructive role in an early political settlement, according to the statement. 
     
            Putin said he welcomed China’s stance on Ukraine and said Moscow would further ensure a consensus is reached between both sides.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would “very much like China to be involved” in Ukraine’s peace plan. 
     
            The Ukrainian peace summit is set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
            Russia has not been represented in any of the four closed-door international peace talks so far and will not be participating this year. China has only attended one hosted by its increasingly close strategic partner, Saudi Arabia.
     
            NATO believes Russian troops don’t have the numbers necessary for a “strategic” breakthrough in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, a senior commander of the military alliance said on Thursday, though he acknowledged that Moscow’s forces have made “local advances.”
     
            Responding to a question about Russian troops pushing deeper into the northeastern region, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told a press conference in Brussels that “(Russians) don’t have the skill and the capability to do it, to operate at the scale necessary to exploit any breakthrough to strategic advantage.”
     
            NATO’s assessment comes after Russian forces took control of several villages close to the border since launching a surprise attack on May 10. 
     
        (Russians) do have the ability to make local advances, and they have done some of that. They have also made some local losses, so I am in very close contact with our Ukrainian colleagues, and I am confident that (Ukraine) will hold the line,” NATO’s Cavoli said.
     
 
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with senior military officials in Kharkiv earlier on Thursday. He described an “extremely difficult” outlook for Kyiv’s troops on the ground, where “we are strengthening our units.” 
     
            Ukraine’s Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn warned combat in the Kharkiv direction “remains complicated and is changing dynamically.”
     
            On the third Thursday of every May, Ukrainians across the globe celebrate the vyshyvanka, a traditional embroidered shirt. 
     
            Yet the stitched panelling of a vyshyvanka extends beyond the garment itself. For many Ukrainians, each star or flower design is a symbolic expression of their right to self-determination.
     
            “I think that vyshyvanka is a very vivid symbol that speaks for itself. Wearing vyshyvanka is very easy to show your identity, your position, your belonging to a certain group,” said Natalia Kamenska, co-founder of the Ukrainian brand Gunja Project. “It is a way of saying ‘We are Ukrainians.’”
     
            Ukrainians mark Vyshyvanka Day by wearing the traditional dress. Kamenska, a designer, told CNN the shirt helps Ukrainian people form a sense of belonging in the face of colossal grief and uncertainty.
     
        “All Ukrainians have been thinking about who we are and how important it is to defend our land, our right to exist on this land, and our independence,” she told CNN. “A lot of people wear vyshyvankas. More and more people have become interested in the history of their family and their country.
     
 
            Kamenska described the war in Ukraine as “a tumultuous time” for her compatriots.
     
            “With families being separated, people fleeing their homeland, people have a sense of constant anxiety from not knowing what will happen tomorrow,” she added. “For many people, vyshyvanka is a thing that reminds them of the importance of everything that is happening now.”
     
            The Russian military is not allowing civilians to evacuate from the town of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukraine’s interior minister on Thursday. Ihor Klymenko said that National Police investigators in the region have launched a criminal investigation “into the violation of the rules and customs of war.” 
     
            CNN is unable to independently verify Klymenko’s claims and has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry for comment. 
     
            Klymenko said the police evacuation teams continue to work in Vovchansk “despite intense fighting and are trying to ensure further evacuation of people.” 
     
            Oleksii Kharkivskyi, the chief patrol officer of the Vovchansk Police Department, posted on Facebook on Thursday that evacuations are still underway and that “staying in the town is dangerous.” 
     
            The head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, also said Thursday that evacuations continue but claims Russian forces have used cluster munitions to attack a village in the Vovchansk area, injuring five people.
     
Some context: The town of Vovchansk, located about 60 km (or about 37 miles) northeast of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, has been the scene of some of the most intense battles in areas near the border in recent days as Russia continues efforts to push deeper into Ukrainian territory.
     
            Every year, on the third Thursday of May, Ukrainians worldwide celebrate Vyshyvanka Day. 
     
            This holiday is dedicated to preserving Ukraine’s famous embroidered shirt, known as a “vyshyvanka,” as a symbol of its people’s material and spiritual heritage. 
     
            Ukrainian embroidery varies in its techniques, and different regions across the country produce their own patterns. Traditionally, each stitch, star or flower has a particular meaning.
     
            In the past, many Ukrainians saw the embroidery as a protective talisman and it represents happiness, fate, life and victory. 
     
        Nowadays, Ukrainians also wear the vyshyvanka as a challenge to Russia, as a display of their national identity and to celebrate the long history of Ukraine.
     
 Today is Vyshyvanka Day, celebrating the traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt.Visible or invisible, it is always under a defender's pixel, a rescuer's uniform, a medic's coat, a power engineer's jacket, a volunteer, a teacher, or anyone who holds the defense.Our children… pic.twitter.com/0hlfnrwo5M 
            Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to strengthen ties across energy, trade, security and geopolitics on Thursday, as both parties displayed their close relationship against the backdrop of regional unrest.
     
            Both leaders shared their vision in a statement released by the Kremlin after a meeting in Beijing, with specific references to the war in Ukraine, sovereignty in Taiwan and fighting in the Middle East. 
     
        “In conditions of international turbulence, Russian-Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,” according to the statement.
     
 
            Putin and Xi said they would “deepen trust” and military “cooperation” by expanding dual exercises and combat training, regularly holding joint sea and air patrols and improving the “level of joint response to challenges and threats.”
     
            The two countries also expressed “very deep concern” over what they described as “extremely destabilizing” US military activity with allies “that have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation.”
     
            Referencing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia said it welcomes the readiness of China “to play a constructive role” in the political and diplomatic settlement of the war.
     
            “It is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,” the statement said. “There can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be fought.”
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with senior military officials in the city of Kharkiv on Thursday, as Russian forces push deeper into the northeastern region. 
     
            The Ukrainian leader described an “extremely difficult” outlook for Kyiv’s troops on the ground, where “we are strengthening our units.” He also met with the senior officials from other border and frontline regions.
     
            Efforts to bolster Ukrainian forces were concentrated in Lyptsi and Vovchansk; a town located about 60 km (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv city and the site of some of the most intense battles near the border. 
     
            At the same time, Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn warned combat in the Kharkiv direction “remains complicated and is changing dynamically.” 
     
            “Our forces are preventing the occupiers from gaining a foothold in certain areas in the northern Kharkiv region,” Voloshyn said in a television interview. 
     
        “The enemy’s advance in certain settlements has been stopped. However, the enemy is trying to ensure conditions for further advancement in order to take advantageous positions,” Voloshyn added. 
     
 
            Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages close to the border since they launched a surprise attack on May 10. 
     
            American soldier Gordon Black, who was arrested in Russia on suspicion of theft, has “admitted guilt” and is cooperating with the investigation, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday quoting law enforcement agencies. 
     
            “The accused admitted guilt and is cooperating with the investigation. This happens in English through an interpreter,” a law enforcement representative told TASS.
     
            Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was arrested in Vladivostok on May 2. He is accused of “committing secret theft” of property and causing “significant damage,” the Pervomaisky District Court of Vladivostok said. 
     
            Black remains in pre-trial detention as authorities assess whether he has been provided everything he needs, including access to a lawyer, the chairman of the regional Public Monitoring Commission (ONC) Vladimir Naidin told TASS.
     
            Black was stationed in South Korea and after completing his service, went to Vladivostok to visit a Russian woman with whom he had a romantic relationship, according to TASS. He was arrested at a time of elevated tensions between the US and Russia as the war in Ukraine grinds on. However, a Russian Foreign Ministry representative told TASS that the case is “not related to politics or espionage.”
     
            At the time of his arrest, the US State Department confirmed that a US citizen was detained in Russia. “We have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas,” a State department spokesperson said at the time. Several other Americans are also being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department – Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan.
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin said he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening.
     
            The talks are expected to include Russia’s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia’s Security Council.
     
            Putin replaced close ally Shoigu as defense minister with Belousov in a major reshuffle of military leadership earlier this week. 
     
            The shake-up comes off the back of significant advances by Russian troops in Ukraine’s east. With defense spending soaring, Belousov’s appointment suggests Russia’s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have pledged to deepen their partnership in Beijing in a stark show of their growing alignment as Russian troops advance in Ukraine.
     
            Xi hailed the two countries’ deepening ties, which were formalized in a joint statement inked by the leaders in a ceremony Thursday, saying they would “inject strong momentum” in the development of their relations.
     
            Putin – whose delegation includes top defense and security officials – was welcomed by Xi to Beijing’s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of his for the start of his two-day state visit.
     
            China is Russia’s main trading partner, and international sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine have driven the two economies closer. 
     
            In meetings with Putin, Xi proclaimed that China-Russian relations have “stood the test of a changing international landscape” and “have been moving forward steadily with enhanced comprehensive strategic coordination,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.
     
        “This has made positive contributions to maintaining global strategic stability and promoting greater democracy in international relations,” it said.

            Following talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Thursday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said “both sides agree that political resolution to the Ukraine issue is the right direction.”
     
        “China’s position on this issue has been consistent and clear, which includes adherence to the UN charter and principles, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country, respect for the legitimate security concerns of each party, and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework,” Xi said. 
     
 
        “China hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role.”
     
 
            Xi lamented that a “cold-war mentality continues to linger” and “unilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country.”
     
Some background: China has repeatedly defended its trade with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace. During meetings with European leaders last week, Xi pushed back against allegations of his country’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.
     
            Ukrainian band 19.99, who played a rendition of Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” with Antony Blinken in Kyiv on Tuesday, said it was a “surreal situation” but they believe it sent an “important message.”
     
            The US Secretary of State made the surprise appearance on stage in a bar in Kyiv as part of his visit to the Ukrainian capital, where he also met President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss battlefield updates and the importance of US aid. 
     
            Dmitry Temnyi, lead singer of 19.99, told CNN’s Rosemary Church on Thursday that it was like a “fairytale” and praised Blinken as a “very good guitarist.”
     
        “Now it’s just every day a struggle for our country and our culture… You need to keep going on, keep moving, do something to support our own family, our own people,” he said. 
     
 
            Drummer Mykyta Kovtunenko said the concert sent an “important message for support in these hard times” to all those watching on TV or online. 
     
        “It was very powerful.”
     
 
            Blinken’s appearance at Barman Dictat — a popular underground cocktail bar and music venue just off Kyiv’s main street, Khreshchatyk — was kept a secret from the band until the last minute. 
     
            The group thought they might be playing with Neil Young as they had been asked to prepare his 1989 hit. 
     
            Guitarist Arsen Gorbach said they had received a message saying that “there won’t be Neil Young, there would be one VIP guest.”
     
        “We were like, wow, interesting, who? And they texted us about Antony Blinken and we like ‘what a surrealistic situation’.”
     
 
            In a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Vladimir Putin hailed China as Russia’s main trading partner, as international sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine drive the two economies closer. 
     
            During his state visit to Beijing on Thursday, Putin said China and Russia have “accumulated a solid baggage of practical cooperation” and identified energy, industry, and agriculture among his priorities, Russian state news agency TASS reported.
     
            In turn, Xi said China is willing to always be Russia’s “good neighbor, friend and partner” and will work together “to consolidate the lasting friendship between the two peoples”  as well as “uphold fairness and justice in the world.”
     
Record trade: Russia’s war in Ukraine has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together — with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel.
     
Sanctions prompt trade shift: The European Union, the US and other nations have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications.
     
            The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with — and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline. The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade, hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule — a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Beijing for the start of a two-day state visit underlining close alignment with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as Russian troops advance in Ukraine.
     
            The visit — Putin’s symbolic first overseas foray since entering a new term as Russia’s president last week – is the latest sign of deepening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy frictions with the West.
     
            This is the fourth in-person meeting between Xi and Putin since Russia’s invasion and Putin’s second visit to Beijing in that time.
     
            Russian troops have been pushing into northeastern Ukraine since their surprise assault on May 10 in the border region of Kharkiv. Their advances in the region are Moscow’s most significant since Ukrainian forces recaptured Kharkiv in 2022.
     
            Here are more of the latest headlines: 
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping rolled out a red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin as the two leaders met in Beijing on Thursday, heralding the start of a two-day state visit. 
     
            Putin was welcomed to the Chinese capital by a military band serenade and multiple-gun salute outside the Great Hall of the People. 
     
            The meeting in Beijing – Putin and Xi’s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 – comes as international concern about the direction of the war mounts.
     
            Xi welcomes Putin under pressure from both the US and Europe to ensure soaring exports from China to Russia since aren’t propping up the Kremlin’s war effort.
     
            White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support – in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines, and microelectronics – from China for Russia’s defense industrial base. 
     
            Beijing has slammed the US as making “groundless accusations” over “normal trade and economic exchanges” between China and Russia.

            As countries around the world ramped up sanctions on Russia in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin still had a powerful friend in Xi Jinping.
     
            This week, Xi is welcoming Putin to China for a two-day state visit — their fourth in-person meeting since Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine began.
     
            The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together — with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel.
     
            The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases in related goods that are consistent with those claims.
     
Sanctions drive economies closer: The European Union, the US and others across the world have imposed sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country.  
     
            Despite these efforts to isolate Putin’s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia’s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.  
     
            China has emerged as a key economic lifeline and is now Russia’s top trade partner.
     
Governments warn against support for Russia’s war effort: White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing’s substantial support for Russia’s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Beijing for the start of a two-day state visit to China, underlining his close alignment with leader Xi Jinping as Russian troops make significant advances in Ukraine.
     
            The visit — Putin’s symbolic first overseas foray since entering a new term as Russia’s president last week – is a mark of Xi’s support for Putin.
     
            Putin landed in the Chinese capital early Thursday morning, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that he would halt all upcoming international visits as his troops defend a surprise Russian offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region.
     
            The meeting in Beijing comes as Russia’s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions.
     
            Ahead of the trip, Putin hailed the “unprecedented level of strategic partnership” between the countries in an interview with Chinese state media Xinhua.
     
        He said the leaders aimed to “strengthen foreign policy coordination” and deepen cooperation in “industry and high-tech, outer space and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and other innovative sectors.”
     
 
            He also praised China’s “approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine.” 
     
            Beijing has never condemned Russia’s invasion. It claims neutrality in the conflict and has called for peace talks that take both sides’ positions into account.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his defense and security forces managed “to partially stabilize the situation” in the northern Kharkiv region, where Russian troops are making advances.
     
            Zelensky said Wednesday night that Ukrainian forces continue defensive actions in areas near the Russian border and in Vovchansk, which is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. 
     
            The border town of Vovchansk was liberated from Russian occupation more than 18 months ago when Ukraine recaptured Kharkiv.
     
            Zelensky said his troops were using artillery, drones, and infantry to stop the advance of Russian troops.
     
            He said all other areas of the Ukrainian frontline are treated with “the same attention” as the Kharkiv region and that Russia’s onslaught will not lead to defensive gaps elsewhere along the frontline.
     
        “We clearly see how the occupier is trying to distract our forces and make our combat work less concentrated. We are reacting to this exactly as we should — we must have the means to retaliate against the enemy in every direction.”
     
 
            Ukraine’s army echoed Zelensky’s words, saying that troops “continue to carry out defense and stabilization measures in Vovchansk and are keeping the situation under control there.”
     
            Russia launched a surprise cross-border assault on May 10, targeting the Kharkiv region.
     
            Ukrainian officials on Wednesday called the town of Vovchansk an epicenter of fierce battles. Russia has already taken control of more than nine villages near the border in recent days.
     
            Russia has stepped up its disinformation efforts to discredit Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and raise questions about his legitimacy in recent months, US intelligence agencies have observed.
     
            A recently downgraded intelligence assessment shared with CNN says that Russia has seized on various recent events to fuel criticism about Zelensky’s abilities and place as Ukraine’s leader, a senior Biden administration official said in an interview.
     
            Russia has spread disinformation about Zelensky since before the war started, but recent intelligence shows “it’s definitely increasing,” the official said.
     
            Russia has highlighted two main areas in this recent disinformation push, the intelligence indicates: Ukraine’s painful withdrawal from the eastern city of Avdiivka, and the fact that Ukraine postponed its presidential election scheduled for this Spring due to the war.
     
Wider impacts: The US is more concerned about the impact of the disinformation on countries abroad than on Ukrainians’ confidence in Zelensky, the official said.
     
        “That’s why we’re briefing our allies and partners about this,” the official said. “We want to make sure that this type of Russian disinformation doesn’t take hold and other countries that might not realize, ‘Oh, of course, they can’t hold elections because they’re in a state of martial law as a consequence of Russia’s war.’”

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US remains “committed” to helping Ukraine win the war against Russia, but it is not encouraging strikes on Russian territory. 
     
        “We’ve not encouraged or enabled strikes outside Ukraine but ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it’s going to conduct this war, a war it’s conducting in defense of its freedom, of its sovereignty, of its territorial integrity and we’ll continue to back Ukraine with the equipment it needs to succeed,” Blinken said on Wednesday in Kyiv. 
     
 
            Blinken also announced that the US will provide $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine, saying “we put this together in a first-of-its-kind defense enterprise fund.”
     
            The fund will have three components, Blinken said, including: 
     
        “Of course, everyone’s eyes are focused on the situation in the east and northeast, Kharkiv in particular. And so the newest support that I just announced, but particularly the $60 billion supplemental, we know is coming at a critical time,” Blinken said.  
     
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday the provision of $2 billion in military financing for Ukraine, and said much-needed weapons and ammunition are being rushed to the front lines. 
     
            “Ukraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught,” Blinken said during a news conference in Kyiv, speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba
     
            He said he discussed weapons deliveries with Kuleba and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
     
        “We are rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses. Rushing them to get to the front lines to protect soldiers, to protect civilians,” Blinken said, pointing out that air defenses are “a top priority.”
     
 
Some background: The US State Department acknowledged that the $2 billion in foreign military financing is coming primarily from the recently passed Ukraine Security supplemental, and $400 million of it is coming from existing Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that had not previously been allocated to Ukraine.
     
            Blinken also said Washington strongly supports a Ukrainian peace summit set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
            At least 1,993 children in Ukraine have been killed or wounded since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to the United Nation’s children’s agency (UNICEF).
     
            On average, at least two children die in Ukraine every day, UNICEF reported on Tuesday. 
     
        “Ukraine’s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services, and psychosocial support,” the agency said in a statement. “More than anything, Ukraine’s children need peace.”
     
 
Mental health impact: The war in Ukraine has “harmfully affected” the mental health and well-being of children, UNICEF said, adding that half of teenagers report trouble sleeping. At least one in five suffer intrusive thoughts and flashbacks.
     
Loss of education: Almost half of children enrolled in school in Ukraine have been robbed of in-person education, according to the report. Nearly one million children across the country cannot access any in-person learning “due to insecurity,” UNICEF said. 
     
            Earlier this year, CNN reported on Ukrainian children attending newly built bunker schools in the northern city of Kharkiv as daily Russian strikes rained down overhead.

Our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine has moved here.
 
            Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing early Thursday morning local time to begin a two-day state visit to China, according to TASS and Chinese state media CCTV.
     
            Russia has stepped up its disinformation efforts to discredit Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and raise questions about his legitimacy in recent months, US intelligence agencies have observed.

Dive deeper into Russia’s disinformation campaign and what it could mean. 
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded his trip to Kyiv on Wednesday, where he reaffirmed the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine as Russia’s advances continue in the Kharkiv region of the country. 
     
            Earlier Wednesday, Blinken announced $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine and said much-needed ammunition and weapons are being rushed to the front lines. The US State Department acknowledged that the $2 billion in foreign military financing is coming primarily from the recently passed Ukraine Security supplemental and $400 million of it is coming from existing Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that had not previously been allocated to Ukraine.
     
            Blinken also said that the US remains “committed” to helping Ukraine win the war against Russia, but it is not encouraging strikes on Russian territory. Blinken added that Washington strongly supports a Ukrainian peace summit set to take place next month in Switzerland.

            Blinken also announced that the US will provide an additional $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine, adding “we put this together in a first-of-its-kind defense enterprise fund.”
     
            The fund will have three components, Blinken said, including: 
     
            “Of course, everyone’s eyes are focused on the situation in the east and northeast, Kharkiv in particular. And so the newest support that I just announced, but particularly the $60 billion supplemental, we know is coming at a critical time,” Blinken said.  
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called a shooting attack on Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico “appalling.” 
     
        “We strongly condemn this act of violence against our neighboring partner state’s head of government. Every effort should be made to ensure that violence does not become the norm in any country, form, or sphere,” Zelensky wrote in a post on X Wednesday. 
     
 
            Fico was shot multiple times, according to a statement on his official Facebook page, adding he is currently in a life-threatening condition.
     
            “We sincerely hope Robert Fico recovers soon and express our solidarity with the people of Slovakia,” Zelensky continued. 
     
For context: Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized Western support for Ukraine. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies toward the Kremlin and blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Russia’s president has used to justify his invasion.
     
            Fico, who began his fourth term last October, has shifted Slovakia’s foreign policy toward pro-Russian positions and initiated reforms in criminal law and media regulations, raising concerns about the erosion of the rule of law.
     
            Fico also had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions in what would upend Slovakia’s staunch backing for Ukraine.
     
            Ukrainian officials suggested further gains by Russian forces on Wednesday in the Kharkiv region, as Moscow continues its push into northeastern Ukraine.
     
            The town of Vovchansk, located about 60 kilometers (or about 37 miles) northeast of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, is seeing some of the most intense battles in areas near the border, with one police official saying Russian forces are already in the town. 
     
        “The situation in Vovchansk is extremely difficult. The enemy is taking positions on the streets of Vovchansk,” said Oleksii Kharkivskyi, chief patrol officer of the Vovchansk Police Department, urging residents to evacuate. 
     
 
            Gen. Serhii “Marcel” Melnyk, the commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, also suggested there have been changes in Ukrainian positions in Vovchansk and a possible tactical withdrawal. 
     
        “Heavy fighting is ongoing. In some areas, near Vovchansk and Lukiantsi, Ukrainian defenders were forced to move to more favorable positions to more effectively use their forces and defend the region from the offensive,” Melnyk said Wednesday. 
     
 
            At least 24 people, including four children, were injured as a result of Russian shelling in various parts of the Kharkiv region on Wednesday, Melnyk said.
     
            The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepStateMap indicated on Wednesday that Russian forces have reached northeastern parts of Vovchansk as they continue to push further south into Ukrainian territory. Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages near the border in recent days. 
     
            Mandatory evacuations continue from all northern border settlements, according to Roman Semenukha, deputy head of Kharkiv Regional Military Administration. Nearly 8,000 people have been evacuated from these areas since May 10, when Russia launched its push. 
     
            At least 1,993 children in Ukraine have been killed or wounded since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to the UN’s children’s agency (UNICEF), reiterating calls for a ceasefire.
     
            On average, at least two children lose their lives in Ukraine every day, UNICEF reported on Tuesday. 
     
        “Ukraine’s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services, and psychosocial support,” the agency said in a statement. “More than anything, Ukraine’s children need peace.”

        “Ukraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught,” Blinken said during a news conference in Kyiv, speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, adding he discussed weapons deliveries with Kuleba and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
     
 
            “We are rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses. Rushing them to get to the front lines to protect soldiers, to protect civilians,” Blinken said, pointing out that air defenses are “a top priority.”
     
            Blinken also said Washington strongly supports a Ukrainian peace summit set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
This post has been updated with the latest comments from Blinken.
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken convened with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv on Wednesday, as part of his surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital.
     
            The senior White House official told the delegation more support for Ukraine is “literally on its way.” 
     
            Kuleba thanked Blinken for the latest aid package from the US, worth nearly $61 billion, and for focusing on “tangible results” in the face of Russia’s invasion. Support from Washington, as well as Blinken’s presence “sends a message to the people of Ukraine,” Kuleba added.
     
            Blinken agreed that sending weapons to the country was more valuable, adding “support in concrete terms is very much on the way.” 
     
            “The people on the frontlines, they need that support and they will get it,” he added. 
     
            The US is committed to working together to build “a strong successful thriving Ukraine,” Blinken said, adding that reaffirming ties with Kyiv would be the strongest “rebuke to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.”
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will halt all international events scheduled for the coming days, his office announced on Wednesday, as Russian troops push into the northeastern Kharkiv region.
     
        “Volodymyr Zelenskyy has instructed that all international events involving him scheduled for the coming days be postponed and new dates coordinated,” Zelensky’s office said in a statement. “We are grateful to our partners for their understanding.”
     
 
            It came days after Ukraine’s top military general warned fighting had “significantly worsened” in Kharkiv, as Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive.
     
In the spotlight: More than two years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Zelensky has fought to keep attention on Kyiv’s military efforts to deter advances from Moscow by strengthening ties with allies. Most recently, he thanked US lawmakers after they voted in favor of a new aid package worth nearly $61 billion. At the same time, European leaders approved a plan for regular payments to Ukraine as part of a $54 billion package.
     
            Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that troops had suppressed a large aerial attack on the Crimean peninsula by Ukrainian forces.
     
            Moscow said that it intercepted 10 “American Atakms [ATACMS] tactical missiles” over Crimea. 
     
            Missiles were shot down near the Belbek military airfield, according to Mikhail Razvozhayev, governor of Crimea’s port city of Sevastopol, suggesting that could be the Ukrainians’ target.
     
            Elsewhere in Russia, there were two explosions at a fuel base in the Proletarsky district because of two drone attacks, according to Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region. 
     
            No casualties were reported in any of the attacks.
     
            During his current visit to Kyiv, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said American ATACMS were part of the newly supplied arms already “on the front lines.”
     
            On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Blinken that Ukraine urgently needed aerial defenses. 
     
            CNN has reached out to Ukrainian authorities for comment. 
     
            Ukraine’s northern region of Kharkiv is enduring “heavy fighting” as Russian troops pushed on with ground and air offensives on Wednesday, Ukraine’s army said. 
     
            “Heavy fighting is ongoing,” said General Serhii Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces. 
     
            “Three combat engagements are still ongoing,” Melnyk said. 
     
        “In some areas, near (the towns of) Vovchansk and Lukiantsi, Ukrainian defenders were forced to move to more favorable positions to more effectively use their forces and defend the region from the offensive.”
     
 
            Kharkiv’s border town of Vovchansk was liberated from Russian occupation more than 18 months ago. 
     
            Ukrainian troops repelled 11 attacks and are holding back Russia’s advance towards “Lyptsi from Hlyboke and Lukiantsi, and towards Vovchansk from the direction of Shebekino (Russia),” Melnyk said.
     
            “Three combat engagements are still ongoing,” Melnyk said. 
     
            Kharkiv city was hit Tuesday by a Russian airstrike that wounded 24 people, including 4 children, and damaged residential buildings, Melnyk said.
     
            The attack also killed one person. 
     
        “On May 14, an enemy drone crashed into a residential building on a city street, killing an 80-year-old woman. Another person was killed in the village of Hatyshche,” according to the city’s defense forces commander.
     
 
            Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that they had “liberated” the settlement of Buhrovatka in the Kharkiv region and “defeated the manpower and equipment” of Ukraine’s army in Vesele, Vovchansk, and Lyptsi.
     
            Russia is continuing its push into northeastern Ukraine since making several advances there over the past week after launching a surprise cross-border assault.
     
            These are Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured the Kharkiv region in 2022. 
     
            On Tuesday, at least 21 civilians, including two 12-year-old girls and an 8-year-old boy, were wounded in Russian attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest, according to prosecutors.
     
            More than 7,500 people have been evacuated from the region. In the neighboring Sumy region, officials have also ordered a “voluntary evacuation” for several towns where attacks have increased, according to the military administration.
     
Here are the latest developments:
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken took to the stage at a bar in Kyiv during his state visit, playing the guitar with a Ukrainian band and singing Neil Young’s 1989 hit “Rockin’ in the Free World.” 
     
        “The United States is with you. So much of the world is with you and they’re fighting not just for Ukraine but for the free world, and the free world is with you too,” Blinken told the crowd. 
     
 
            The visit, in which Blinken met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, comes as Russian forces make significant gains on the battlefield.  
     
            The US State Department said Blinken and Zelensky discussed battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived US aid to help repel Russian attacks. Zelensky told US Blinken that Ukraine urgently needs more air defenses.
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the “unprecedented level of strategic partnership” between Moscow and Beijing informed his decision to choose China for his first trip since entering a new term in office just over a week ago.
     
        “Today, Russia-China relations have reached the highest level ever, and despite the difficult global situation continue to get stronger,” Putin said in an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday, ahead of his arrival in Beijing on Thursday.
     
 
            During his visit, Putin is expected to discuss situations in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, according to Putin’s assistant for foreign affairs, Yuri Ushakov, state media RIA Novosti reported.
     
            Speaking to Xinhua, Putin commended China for its 12-point plan calling to end hostilities in Ukraine and bashed Ukraine’s “Western patrons” for “stubbornly working to ‘punish’ Russia, isolate and weaken it.”
     
More context: Putin’s visit mirrors Xi’s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president – like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve.
     
            It also comes as Russia claims to have captured further villages in Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv region as it expands its surprise cross-border offensive.
     
Read the full story.
 
            Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator announced on Tuesday that emergency power cuts are being introduced following a series of Russian attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure.
 
            Emergency shutdowns across Ukraine were implemented from 9 p.m. to midnight local time Tuesday, according to Ukrenergo.
     
            The “significant” power shortage had been made worse when people used more energy during recent cold weather, Ukrenergo added. 
     
More context: Moscow has stepped up efforts to paralyze Ukraine’s energy system in the past month, as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold positions on key frontlines, particularly in the east.
     
            On May 8, Russian forces carried out a “massive” missile attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, targeting power generation and transmission facilities in the Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Vinnytsia regions.
     
            Ukraine’s biggest power company, DTEK, said Russian missiles hit three of its thermal power plants on May 8, adding it was the fifth time its infrastructure had been targeted in the last six weeks. 
     
            At least 21 civilians, including two 12-year-old girls and an 8-year-old boy, were wounded in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on Tuesday, according to prosecutors.
     
            Russian forces used glide bombs in three waves of attacks, striking more than 20 targets, according to Oleksandr Filchakov, Kharkiv region prosecutor.
     
            Glide bombs can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives and are dropped from aircraft which — in the case of attacks on the Kharkiv border region — do not even need to enter Ukrainian airspace.
     
            Writing on Telegram, Filchakov said that several apartment blocks, a shopping center, and an education institution were damaged in the bombardment that also set cars and garages ablaze. 
     
            The attack comes as Russian forces continue their advance into the Kharkiv region. Russian troops are regaining control of villages and areas of Ukraine that they were forced from near the end of 2022 during a Ukrainian counteroffensive. 
     
            Ukraine’s State Emergency Service on Tuesday said over 7,500 civilians had been evacuated from their homes during heavy fighting in the north of Kharkiv region. 
     
            Reporting live from central Ukraine, CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh said Russian troops are moving fast and have better resources and better ammunition. It is also clear that Ukrainians have failed to build sufficient defenses in the region.
     
            Ukraine is calling for more rocket artillery ammunition and missiles to be sent to them as a priority, especially 155mm shells, so that it can repel Russia’s resurgent invading force. 
     
            Georgia’s president has called on protesters to use their vote in upcoming parliamentary elections to “reverse” the controversial foreign agents law passed by the country’s parliament on Tuesday.
     
            President Salome Zourabichvili admitted to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that there are “many concerns” after the parliament voted in favor of the controversial foreign agents law.
     
        “The way and the place where we can reverse all of this is the elections in October… And we have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections,” Zourabichvili said.
     
 
            The president, who has previously accused Russia of trying to bolster its influence over the former Soviet country, told CNN that she will symbolically veto the law.
     
            Due to the setup of Georgia’s parliamentary system, Zourabichvili holds mainly a figurehead role and her veto can be overruled by a simple parliamentary majority.
     
            She called the law a complete “duplicate” of one passed by the Kremlin in 2012, which she said has been used to “completely oppress and repress the civil society” in Russia.
     
            Russia is growing more and “more worried” by Georgia’s rapprochement with the European Union, Zourabichvili remarked, referencing the recent decision by the bloc to grant Georgia candidate status.
     
            Although roughly 20% of Georgian territory is currently controlled by Russia following the 2008 invasion, Georgia has not been “diverted” from “following its European path,” the president added.
     
        “It has not stopped us an inch and it will not stop us continuing,” she added.
     
 
            The White House has slammed Georgia’s controversial foreign agents legislation, warning that if enacted, it would “compel” the US to reevaluate its relationship with the country.
     
        “We’re deeply troubled by Georgia’s Kremlin-style foreign agents legislation,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.“We will see what the parliament does, but if this legislation passes, it will compel us to fundamentally reassess our relationship with Georgia.”
     
 
            When pressed later on what she meant, Jean-Pierre would not elaborate. The legislation has already passed the country’s parliament, but its president has vowed to veto it. It’s unclear if that veto would then be overridden. 
     
            The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country that, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow’s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit.
     
            Georgia’s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili. Zourabichvili will then have two weeks to veto it, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the US intends to make use of seized Russian assets to provide funding for the reconstruction of Ukraine.
     
            “Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,” Blinken said during a speech at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine. 
     
        “What Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.”
     
 
            Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with “Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets.”
     
        “The G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,” Blinken said.
     
 
            Blinken’s remarks come after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Blinken reiterated the US “commitment to Ukraine’s recovery,” according to a State Department spokesperson.
     
            During his visit to Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the Biden administration’s strong support of the beleaguered country as Russia advances in the Kharkiv region.
     
        “I have come to Ukraine with a message. You are not alone,” Blinken said at a briefing at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute on Tuesday.
     
 
            The speech came after Congress and the White House passed a funding package that included $60-plus billion in aid to Ukraine, and the EU approved a financial package of up to $54 billion.
     
            Blinken focused much of his speech on building security and economic infrastructure in Ukraine to pave a path to NATO acceptance.
     
        “When we hold the Washington Summit in July, we’ll take tangible steps to increase NATO’s role in building a resilient, capable Ukrainian force, supporting its ongoing reforms that are integrating Ukraine into the alliance,” Blinken said.
     
 
            Georgia’s parliament has passed a controversial “foreign agents” bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country’s chances of joining the bloc.
     
            The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines. 
     
            Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.
     
            Georgian Dream, the ruling party that pushed through the legislation, has hit back at criticism, saying the move will promote transparency and national sovereignty. But the party has long been suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies.
     
            Nightly protests have been shutting down the capital, Tbilisi, for about a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the city of 1 million people to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”
     
            Georgia applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic’s drift toward Russia.
     
            Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and still occupies about 20% of Georgia’s internationally recognized territory.
     
            While attention is focused on advances in Kharkiv, Russia’s forces continue to exploit Ukraine’s weaknesses elsewhere, in particular along a stretch of the frontline west of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk.
     
            Since Russia captured the industrial town of Avdiivka in February, its forces have taken advantage of Kyiv’s acute shortage in artillery ammunition, as well as manpower deficiencies, by pushing into a series of towns and villages.
     
            Ukraine’s General Staff, in its Tuesday morning update, hinted clearly at further tactical withdrawals in the area around the village of Ocheretyne – which was captured by Russian troops earlier this month.
     
        “In order to save the lives of our defenders, the positions of the Defense Forces were changed in some areas due to intense enemy fire,” the General Staff reported.
     
 
            The DeepStateMap monitoring group shows small Russian advances most days in the area, each one moving them a little closer to the town of Pokrovsk, a key military hub for logistics and supplies along the entire eastern part of the frontline.
     
            Further to the west, Ukrainian forces are also coming under pressure southeast of Zaporizhzhia, one of the few areas where they achieved success, albeit modest in size, in last summer’s counteroffensive.
     
            Both Russian military bloggers and Ukraine’s DeepStateMap report small Russian advances into a pocket of re-captured Ukrainian territory between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove.
     
            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister has hailed ties with Serbia, traditionally seen as one of Europe’s more Russian-leaning states, on a visit to Belgrade. 
     
            He was accompanied on the trip by Olena Zelenska, wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
     
            In March 2022, Kyiv’s Serbian embassy closed with the United States and the United Kingdom accusing Serbian businesses of assisting Russia in circumventing sanctions. 
     
            Following Monday’s meeting between Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic the embassy is set to be reopened. 
     
        “We are grateful to the Serbian president for agreeing to hold a Ukrainian-Serbian business forum in the near future, as well as to resume the work of the Serbian embassy in Ukraine for the first time since March 2022,” Kuleba said in a post on X.
     
 
            Kuleba also said he and Vucic discussed a variety of bilateral issues building on “productive dialogue” Vucic has previously had with Zelensky. 
     
            Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has aided the war-torn country by sheltering Ukrainians and donating humanitarian aid.
     
            First Lady Olena Zelenska expressed gratitude to Serbia for its contribution.
     
        “The needs of Ukrainians for emergency medical care have increased significantly, as the Russian terror against Ukrainian settlements not only continues, but also shows an alarming tendency to intensify,” Zelenska said.“I am grateful to Serbia for understanding that people matter most,” added Zelenska, who visited the country to take part in a mental health conference. 
     
 
            Traditionally one of Moscow’s closest allies in Europe, Belgrade has long tried to balance its historical ties to Russia and a potential future of closer European integration.
     
            Serbia’s contribution to Ukraine aid can be seen as part of its commitment to joining the European Union, but its relationship with the bloc is strained refusing to participate in EU sanctions rounds against Russia.

Our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine has moved here.
 
            Georgia’s president has called on protesters to use their vote in upcoming parliamentary elections to “reverse” the controversial foreign agents law passed by the country’s parliament on Tuesday.
     
            President Salome Zourabichvili admitted to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that there are “many concerns” after the parliament voted in favor of the controversial foreign agents law.
     
        “The way and the place where we can reverse all of this is the elections in October…And we have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections,” Zourabichvili said.
     
 
            The president, who has previously accused Russia of trying to bolster its influence over the former Soviet country, told CNN that she will symbolically veto the law.
     
            Due to the setup of Georgia’s parliamentary system, Zourabichvili holds mainly a figurehead role and her veto can be overruled by a simple parliamentary majority.
     
            She called the law a complete “duplicate” of one passed by the Kremlin in 2012 which she said has been used to “completely oppress and repress the civil society” in Russia.
     
            Russia is growing more and “more worried” by Georgia’s rapprochement with the European Union, Zourabichvili remarked, referencing the recent decision by the bloc to grant Georgia candidate status.
     
            Although roughly 20% of Georgian territory is currently controlled by Russia following the 2008 invasion, Georgia has not been “diverted” from “following its European path,” the president added.
     
            “It has not stopped us an inch and it will not stop us continuing,” she added.
     
            The White House has slammed Georgia’s controversial foreign agents legislation, warning that if enacted it would “compel” the US to reevaluate its relationship with the country.
     
        “We’re deeply troubled by Georgia’s Kremlin-style foreign agents legislation,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday. 
     
 
            “This weekend, we saw some of the largest protests in Georgia’s history, with tens of thousands of peaceful protesters, undeterred by intimidation tactics telling their government to oppose this legislation because they want a Euro-Atlantic future. 
     
            “We will see what the parliament does, but if this legislation passes, it will compel us to fundamentally reassess our relationship with Georgia.”
     
            When pressed later on what she meant, Jean-Pierre would not elaborate. The legislation has already passed the country’s parliament, but its president has vowed to veto it. It’s unclear if that veto would then be overridden. 
     
            Georgia’s parliament passed the controversial law by 84 votes to 30, despite widespread domestic opposition to the move, which would require any organizations receiving more than 20% of funding from abroad to register as foreign agents.
     
            Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.
     
            The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country which, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow’s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit.
     
            Georgia’s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili. Zourabichvili will then have two weeks to veto it, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority.
     
            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister has hailed ties with Serbia, traditionally seen as one of Europe’s more Russian-leaning states, on a visit to Belgrade. He was accompanied on the trip by Olena Zelenska, wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
     
            In March 2022, Kyiv’s Serbian embassy closed with the United States and the United Kingdom accusing Serbian businesses of assisting Russia in circumventing sanctions. 
     
            Following Monday’s meeting between Foreign Minister Kuleba and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic the embassy is set to be reopened. 
     
            “We are grateful to the Serbian president for agreeing to hold a Ukrainian-Serbian business forum in the near future, as well as to resume the work of the Serbian embassy in Ukraine for the first time since March 2022,” Kuleba said in a post on X.
     
            Kuleba also said he and Vucic discussed a variety of bilateral issues building on “productive dialogue” Vucic has previously had with Zelensky. 
     
            Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has aided the war-torn country by sheltering Ukrainians and donating humanitarian aid.
     
            In a statement during her visit to the country to participate in a mental health conference, First Lady Olena Zelenska expressed gratitude to Serbia for its contribution.
     
        “The needs of Ukrainians for emergency medical care have increased significantly, as the Russian terror against Ukrainian settlements not only continues, but also shows an alarming tendency to intensify,” Zelenska said. 
     
 
            “I am grateful to Serbia for understanding that people matter most,” added Zelenska, who visited the country to take part in a mental health conference. 
     
            Traditionally one of Moscow’s closest allies in Europe, Belgrade has long tried to walk a tightrope between its historical ties to Russia and a potential future of closer European integration.
     
            Serbia’s contribution to Ukraine aid can be seen as part of its commitment to joining the European Union, but its relationship with the bloc is strained refusing to participate in EU sanctions rounds against Russia.  
     
            “Serbia is deeply committed to becoming a member of the European Union and has voted for the United Nations resolution condemning Russian actions in Ukraine and has upheld its territorial integrity and sovereignty, and repeatedly sent various types of aid,” Serbia’s ambassador to the United States said in a statement to CNN last year. 
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the US intends to make use of seized Russian assets to provide funding for the reconstruction of Ukraine.
     
            “Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,” Blinken said during a speech at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine. 
     
        “What Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.”
     
 
            Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with “Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets.”
     
            “The G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,” Blinken said.
     
            Blinken’s remarks come after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Blinken reiterated the US “commitment to Ukraine’s recovery,” according to a State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller.
     
            During his visit to Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the Biden administration’s strong support of the beleaguered country amid Russia’s recent advances in Kharkiv.
     
        “I have come to Ukraine with a message. You are not alone,” Blinken said at a briefing at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.
     
 
            The speech comes after Congress and the White House passed a funding package that included $60-plus billion in aid to Ukraine, and the EU approved a financial package of up to $54 billion.
     
            Blinken focused much of his speech about building security and economic infrastructure in Ukraine to pave a path to NATO acceptance. 
     
            “When we hold the Washington Summit in July, we’ll take tangible steps to increase NATO’s role in building a resilient, capable Ukrainian force, supporting its ongoing reforms that are integrating Ukraine into the alliance,” Blinken said.
     
            French President Emmanuel Macron told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call on Tuesday that France will send more military aid to Ukraine “in the coming days and weeks.”
     
            During the call, Macron condemned the “intensification of Russian strikes on Ukraine, notably on its energy infrastructure” and reiterated “France’s determination to provide all the support necessary” to Kyiv in concert with its international partners.
     
            Georgia’s parliament has passed a controversial “foreign agents” bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country’s chances of joining the bloc.
     
            The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.
     
            Georgian Dream, the ruling party that pushed through the legislation, has hit back at criticism, saying the move will promote transparency and national sovereignty. But the party has long been suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies.
     
            Nightly protests have been shutting down the capital, Tbilisi, for about a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the city of 1 million people to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”
     
            Georgia applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic’s drift toward Russia.
     
            Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and still occupies about 20% of Georgia’s internationally recognized territory.
     
            While attention is focused on advances in Kharkiv, Russia’s forces continue to exploit Ukraine’s weaknesses elsewhere, in particular along a stretch of the frontline west of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk.
     
            Since Russia captured the industrial town of Avdiivka in February, its forces have taken advantage of Kyiv’s acute shortage in artillery ammunition, as well as manpower deficiencies, by pushing into a series of towns and villages.
     
            Ukraine’s General Staff, in its Tuesday morning update, hinted clearly at further tactical withdrawals in the area around the village of Ocheretyne – which was captured by Russian troops earlier this month.
     
            “In order to save the lives of our defenders, the positions of the Defense Forces were changed in some areas due to intense enemy fire,” the General Staff reported.
     
            The DeepStateMap monitoring group shows small Russian advances most days in the area, each one moving them a little closer to the town of Pokrovsk, a key military hub for logistics and supplies along the entire eastern part of the frontline.
     
            Further to the west, Ukrainian forces are also coming under pressure southeast of Zaporizhzhia, one of the few areas where they achieved success, albeit modest in size, in last summer’s counteroffensive.
     
            Both Russian military bloggers and Ukraine’s DeepStateMap report small Russian advances into a pocket of re-captured Ukrainian territory between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv earlier Tuesday, a meeting that comes at especially difficult time for Ukraine. Russia continues its push into northeastern Ukraine after making several advances there over the past week, marking Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured Kharkiv in 2022. Here is what you need to know:
     
            European Union (EU) leaders on Tuesday approved a plan that will see a regular flow of payments as part of its Ukraine financial assistance plan, known as the Ukraine Facility program, after the bloc determined the country has met the preconditions required to unlock a financial package of up to $54 billion.
     
            The Ukraine Facility program, according to the EU Council, is intended to help assist Ukraine with the recovery, reconstruction and modernization of the country.
     
            According to an EU Council press release, an initial $2 billion of “pre-financing” will be disbursed until regular payments can begin. The payments will be subjected to the agreed reforms Ukraine must take as part of its EU accession process in the next four years.
     
            “An important step has been made to deliver much-needed, regular and predictable financial support to Ukraine’s recovery, reconstruction, and modernisation over the next four years. The EU has once more confirmed its commitment to Ukraine’s stability and growth,” Vincent van Peteghem, president of the EU Council, said in a statement. 
     
            Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked EU members for approving the plan. Writing on Telegram, he said he expects Ukraine to receive $17 billion in the next year under the program.
     
        “This will strengthen our financial stability in the face of a full-scale war with Russia,” Shmyhal said.
     
 
            More than 7,000 people have been evacuated from the Kharkiv region, the head of the region’s military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said on Tuesday. 
     
            The majority of the evacuations took place in the Chuhuiv and Kharkiv districts, with volunteers assisting efforts. 
     
            Meanwhile, the Sumy region, which borders the Kharkiv region, has also ordered a “voluntary evacuation” for several towns where attacks have increased, according to the region’s military administration.
     
            In a statement on Telegram, the Sumy regional military administration outlined that people in Bilopillia and Vorozhba are being encouraged to evacuate, especially families and children. 
     
        “This is not a forced evacuation, but an early voluntary evacuation from those settlements where the number of attacks has significantly increased,” the head of the region’s military administration, Volodymyr Artuikh, said Tuesday.
     
 
            The administration also stated that evacuation efforts are also continuing for border communities in the region, which have been under an evacuation order since July 2023.
     
            Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has sought to reassure Ukrainians that Russia’s operations in the northern Kharkiv border area will not lead to defensive gaps elsewhere along the frontline.
     
            “We understand how the enemy is acting, and we see the plan to draw our forces back,” Zelensky said in an address on Monday evening.
     
            “Of course, we are not leaving the Donetsk areas without the necessary support and supplies, namely the Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk directions,” he added.
     
            Many Ukrainians believe Russia’s real intentions in its Kharkiv push are to force Ukraine to redeploy troops defending key locations further south, including Chasiv Yar, which sits on high ground west of Bakhmut. 
     
            Russian soldiers have been making steady advances towards it in recent weeks and the capture of Chasiv Yar would being Russia closer to three key military towns – Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – in the Donetsk region.
     
            While Russia’s desire to capture all of Donetsk is clear – it announced it had annexed the region back in 2022 – some analysts argue the Kharkiv operation might also be about the creation of a buffer zone along Russia’s border with Ukraine.
     
            The Institute for the Study of War says reports of the destruction of several bridges across key waterways suggest Moscow is “prioritizing the creation of a ‘buffer zone’ over a deeper penetration into the region.”
     
            Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has made several references in the past to creating such a zone inside Ukraine, to better protect Russian towns like Belgorod from coming under Ukrainian attack.
     
            Russian forces continue to make advances south into Ukrainian villages in the Kharkiv region after launching their surprise cross-border assault four days ago.  
     
            One of the main Russian efforts appears targeted on Lyptsi, described by one Ukrainian military blogger as “a very important village” – due to its position on Ukraine’s second defensive line.
     
            The DeepStateMap monitoring group indicates two further settlements in the direction of the village have been taken under full or partial Russian control, though Serhii Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, said an attempted advance on Lyptsi itself had been repelled.
     
            Reports make clear that Russia continues to make heavy use of large glide bombs ahead of its ground operations. Glide bombs can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives and are dropped from aircraft which – in the case of attacks on the Kharkiv border region – do not even need to enter Ukrainian airspace.
     
            A Ukrainian National Guard Special Forces unit reported 20 such aerial attacks in one direction alone.
     
            Meanwhile, a few dozen kilometers to the east, Vovchansk remains a Russian focus, though it appears Ukraine has still managed to prevent a full Russian assault on the town.
     
            German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has appealed to European countries to do more to support Ukraine, saying he hoped they would provide Ukraine with “munition, artillery, tanks, and air defense, and especially Patriot [air defense systems.]”
     
            Speaking in Stockholm on Tuesday, the German chancellor vowed support for Ukraine for as long as necessary.
     
            Scholz said Germany’s announcement in April that it would send a third Patriot system to Ukraine had not been an easy decision as Germany did not have many systems of its own. 
     
            Some of Ukraine’s allies have come under increasing pressure to provide Ukraine with air defense systems.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month showed his dissatisfaction over deliveries of Western military aid from key allies, saying air defense, in particular Patriot systems, were “what [Ukraine’s] partners have and what should be working here in Ukraine now, to destroy Russian terrorist ambitions.” 
     
            Only the US, Germany and the Netherlands have supplied Patriot systems to Ukraine so far. Spain promised to send Patriot missiles but not a full battery.
     
            Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that his country urgently needs more air defenses as it faces increased attacks from Russia in the east.
     
            “Air defense (is) the biggest deficit for us. I think that the biggest problem is … today we really need two Patriots for Kharkiv region because there are people under attack: civilians and warriors. Everybody. They are under Russian missiles,” Zelensky told reporters ahead of his meeting with Blinken. 
     
            The Institute for the Study of War in Washington said last month that Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukraine have become much more effective in recent months, even though there was no dramatic increase in their size or frequency.
     
            “Instead, Russian forces are exploiting the degradation of Ukraine’s air defense umbrella caused by continued delays in Western security assistance and appear to be leveraging tactical adaptations stemming from several months of Russian efforts to test Ukrainian air defenses,” the Washington-based group said in a report. 
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has concluded his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, after discussing “recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived U.S. security assistance,” according to US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
     
            “The two discussed recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly-arrived US security assistance to helping repel Russian attacks,” Miller said in a read-out following the meeting. “They also discussed long-term security arrangements and ongoing work to ensure Ukraine can thrive economically. Secretary Blinken reiterated the United States’ enduring support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and our commitment to Ukraine’s recovery.”
     
            Blinken’s visit comes as Russia continues its new push into northeastern Ukraine after making several major advances there over the past week, marking Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured Kharkiv in late summer 2022.
     
            US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the long-awaited US military assistance has started arriving in Ukraine, after months of delays caused by political haggling in the US Congress. 
     
            Blinken is the first of Biden administration official to visit Kyiv after the passage of the Ukraine funding, which Kyiv and its allies hope could be a turning point in the war. 
     
            The $61 billion package includes about $23 billion to replenish US weapons, stockpiles and facilities and nearly $14 billion to help Ukraine buy advanced weapons systems and other defense equipment. More than $11 billion will fund current US military operations in the wider region.
     
            As he met Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday, Blinken said that “the assistance was now on the way.” 
     
            “Some of it already arrived, and more of it will be arriving, and that’s going to make a real difference against the Russian aggression on the battlefield,” he said. “We are determined, along with many partners of Ukraine, to make sure you succeed on the battlefield.”
     
            US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has arrived in Kyiv at the time when Ukraine needs as much help as it can get. 
     
            Russia has made significant gains on the battlefield in recent weeks, including on Ukraine’s northern border near Kharkiv, where it took control of several villages. Kharkiv is Ukraine’s second biggest city and it is becoming more vulnerable to attacks as Russia inches closer to its edges.
     
            In a rare and frank admission of how bad the picture is at the moment, Ukraine’s top general Oleksandr Syrskyi said that the situation in the northern Kharkiv region has “significantly worsened” after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. 
     
            Moscow has managed to take advantage of Ukraine’s ammunition shortages, pushing through multiple spots alongside the eastern Ukraine frontline as the US Congress dragged its feet for months on the $61 billion Ukraine aid package.
     
            The assistance has been approved last month, but it will take months for the crucial weapons to be delivered where they are needed. Russia, meanwhile, continues to gain momentum. 
     
            Blinken admitted as much ahead of his meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying “We know this is a challenging time.”
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday, marking the first visit of a Biden administration official to Ukraine following the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country, the State Department announced.
     
            Coming amid Ukrainian setbacks on the battlefield, Blinken intends to send a “strong signal of reassurance to the Ukrainians,” the official said.
     
        “The secretary’s mission here is really to talk about how our supplemental assistance is going to be executed in a fashion that helps shore up their defenses, enable them to increasingly take back the initiative on the battlefield looking forward,” the official said.
     
 
            Blinken will also discuss “the other steps that we’re taking to provide long-term assurance and commitment on the security front to the Ukrainians, including our bilateral security agreement,” the official added.
     
            During his fourth visit to Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion, Blinken is also scheduled to meet with civil society and private sector partners as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. US officials acknowledge that the slowdown in US support, due to congressional infighting, has exacerbated a challenging situation for Ukraine.

            Cinese leader Xi Jinping will welcome Vladimir Putin to China on Thursday for the Russian president’s second visit in less than a year – the latest sign of their growing alignment amid hardening global fault lines as conflict devastates Gaza and Ukraine.
     
            Putin will arrive in China just over a week since entering a new term in office, extending his autocratic rule until 2030 – the result of an election without any true opposition.
     
            His visit, set to take place May 16-17, according to Chinese state media, mirrors Xi’s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president – like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve.
     
            Their meeting comes months ahead of the American presidential elections and as Washington faces mounting international backlash over its support for Israel’s war on Gaza. It’s set to provide a platform for the leaders to discuss how all this can advance their shared ambition to degrade and offer an alternative to American power.
     
            The visit also comes as the two leaders operate within what observers say is a loose but growing coordination of interests between avowedly anti-American countries Iran and North Korea. Pyongyang – which has an economy almost entirely dependent of China – is believed by Western governments to be aiding Russia with war supplies, as is Tehran, which is being bolstered economically by Russia and China and is a powerful player in the conflict in the Middle East.

            Uraine’s top general says the situation in the northern Kharkiv region has “significantly worsened” after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive.
     
            A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia’s progress was not yet “significant” but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an “extremely dangerous moment,” adding that Russia had effectively “invaded [Ukraine] again.”
     
            The precise goal of Russia’s new push – which began in the early hours of Friday morning – is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south.
     
            Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south – which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address.
     
            “The idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians’ ability to defend ourselves,” he said.
     
            According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city.

            Rssian President Vladimir Putin’s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country’s defense ministry with someone widely seen as a competent technocrat.
     
            That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry of Defense from Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012.
     
            Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia’s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia’s economy.
     
            “Putin’s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,” Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X. “Belousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.”
     
            Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia.
     
            US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition: NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly three times more artillery shells per year than the US and Europe for Ukraine.

            The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”
     
            You rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline.
     
            Moscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61 billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead.
     
            First, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war.  
     
            And secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.
     
            Ukraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year.
