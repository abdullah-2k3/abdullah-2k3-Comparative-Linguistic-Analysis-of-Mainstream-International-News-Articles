Instead, he volunteered at a hospital to help those who couldn’t run – even if they wanted to. On October 1, Jawad, a 56-year-old American citizen, father of four and cherished figure in the Dearborn, Michigan, community, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, his family says. The tragedy attests to fears of the conflict spilling over into the wider region being realized as Israel expands its assault. “We are honored by my father’s sacrifice. In his last days, he chose to stay near the main hospital in Nabatieh to help the elderly, disabled, injured, and those who simply couldn’t financially afford to flee,” his daughter, Nadine Jawad, wrote in a statement on Facebook . ”He served as their guardian, provided them with food, mattresses, and other comforts, and anonymously paid off their debts. I would often ask him if he was scared, and he repeatedly told me that we should not be scared because he is doing what he loves the most: helping others live in the land he loved the most.” Residents run for cover following an Israeli airstrike in Dahiyeh, Beirut, Lebanon, Friday, Oct. 4, 2024.

CNN has reached out to the Israeli military, which said they could not comment without being given the exact coordinates and time of the strike that killed Jawad. Israel has pummeled Lebanon with an unprecedented airstrike campaign, killing over 1,400 people, injuring nearly 7,500 others and displacing more than a million people from their homes , according to the Lebanese health ministry. The bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, according to the conflict monitoring group Airwars. In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated the Iran-backed group a terrorist organization. Israel and Hezbollah have been locked in tit-for-tat escalation since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a deadly attack in Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli officials. In the ensuing war in Gaza, Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive has so far killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children , according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Militant groups from Lebanon to Yemen – as well as Iran – have responded by launching attacks on Israel, which has responded in kind, heightening fears of a wider regional war .

Lebanese officials have accused Israel of indiscriminately bombing populated civilian areas, including the capital Beirut. CNN teams in Beirut this week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. As a result, the death toll in Lebanon continues to rise, with a fifth of its population now displaced. But for Jawad, it was the people – not the geopolitics – that mattered most. “In his last moments, my father was calm. He emphasized our collective responsibility to help the oppressed. Even as he witnessed destruction from the missiles falling around him, his certainty in the importance of caring for community – in any and every capacity possible – remained,” his daughter wrote. “Our father’s message was clear: stop arming, aiding, and abetting our oppression and start caring for the people struggling for their freedom and dignity.” An American community in mourning Jawad’s killing has ignited an outpouring of love and fond memories in Dearborn, home to the largest Arab American and Lebanese communities in the US. In the days since his death, friends, family, community members and local officials have posted tributes online to the man they say was beloved for his selflessness and dedication to both his American and Lebanese communities. Many recall him as a kind, generous person who didn’t like to make a fuss out of his good deeds. He was known for saving money each year to return to Lebanon and help people, feeding them and paying off strangers’ debts without them ever knowing it was him, friends said. Jawad was also the founder of the nonprofit Lebanese Diaspora Relief Org, which provides families in Lebanon who are in need with food and medical supplies. “There are some people in this world who when you meet them, sincerity shines out from them,” Hamzah Raza, Jawad’s friend, said in a statement on Facebook. “He was someone who loved people. And loved helping people. “We applaud him on leaving this world as a martyr,” Raza said. “Yet we are sad for humanity. We are sad at the oppression of the Israeli state. We are sad that an American was killed by (Israel) with weapons given to him by his own government.” Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed in the West Bank Wednesday, the network said. 
Bureau chief Waleed Al Omari wept on air as he announced the news.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said she was shot in the head by a live bullet in Jenin, and confirmed her death shortly afterwards. 
A second journalist, Ali Al-Samudi, was also shot and is in stable condition, the ministry said.
The Israel Defense Forces said Israeli security forces had been operating in the area to arrest suspects in terrorist activities, said both suspects and Israeli forces fired, and acknowledged the possibility that journalists were hit. Facebook/Shireen Abu Akleh Related article Israel reveals US probe into Shireen Abu Akleh’s death but says it ‘will not cooperate’ American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee National Executive Director Abed Ayoub, who is Lebanese and from Dearborn, told CNN that Jawad was a well-respected member of the community who contributed to its betterment every day. “He’s leaving behind an incredible legacy, and someone that’s going to truly be missed, somebody that really embodies the best of Lebanon and the best of Dearborn in the US,” Ayoub told CNN. “It’s a tragic loss for the community, a tragic loss for his family, for his parents, for all of us in the city.” US Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Debbie Dingell of Michigan are among the many who paid tribute to Jawad and his family. Other Lebanese American families in Dearborn also are grieving the loss of loved ones back home, including Ali Dabaja, who said at least five family members were recently killed by Israeli airstrikes in Bint Jbeil, a city in southern Lebanon. His cousin Batoul Dabaja-Saad, her husband and their three children – the youngest 8 years old – were buried beneath the rubble of their home, he said. Dabaja, who is close friends with the Jawad family and says he is heartbroken over his killing, said the Dearborn community is in “collective mourning” and that every death – including every Palestinian killed by Israel since October 7 – has caused the community the same measure of pain. “These are all lives that mean something to us, every single one of those human beings, those Arabs, those brown faces, have been allowed to die, but they had stories and ambitions and every single time one of those lives are lost for us, it compounds our tragedy,” Dabaja told CNN. “With each death, a fire inside of us continues to burn, and it burns stronger.” Smoke rises following Israeli strikes in Rafah, Gaza, on May 28. Hatem Khaled/Reuters Related article US releases $3.5 billion to Israel to spend on US weapons and military equipment, months after Congress appropriated With their sorrow comes anger and despair – and a sense that US leaders are not listening to their pleas for an end to the violence that has claimed the lives of so many loved ones. “We don’t just need soft words and words of diplomacy,” Dabaja said. “We need action, we need change in policy, policy that says no to war, a policy that says no to foreign funding of wars.” The US State Department confirmed to CNN on Friday that Jawad was a US citizen, not a legal permanent resident as spokesperson Matthew Miller initially said on Wednesday. Miller’s initial remarks disclaiming Jawad’s citizenship was criticized by the Arab American community and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which told CNN the rushed statements hurt the community and undermined the extent of Jawad’s loss. “We are aware and alarmed of reports of the death of Kamel Jawad, who we have confirmed is a US citizen,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN, adding that they “are working to understand the circumstances of the incident.” “As we have noted repeatedly, it is a moral and strategic imperative that Israel take all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm,” the spokesperson said. “Any loss of civilian life is a tragedy.” ‘Your duty is to the poor’ The Jawad family has denied all requests to speak to the media. In an Instagram exchange with a journalist, Nadine Jawad cited the “dehumanizing” coverage of Arabs and Arab Americans. Jawad said in her statement on Facebook her father “never viewed himself as a savior,” only that he was “part of a much larger movement of people who refuse to stay silent in the face of oppression.” He dedicated his life – and ultimately sacrificed it – for his beloved Lebanese community, in Lebanon and here in the US. But his American citizenship, his daughter says, does not make his life any more valuable than the lives of the thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes. “His service and dedication to helping those in need is not over,” she wrote, vowing to continue his work. Before he was killed, Jawad sent his children a simple voice note: “Peace be upon you. Everything is ok, but if something happens to me your duty is to the poor.” The family has already launched a fundraiser in Jawad’s honor, collecting more than $88,000 to help feed and aid displaced Lebanese civilians through his nonprofit organization. “Their death isn’t just a death, it isn’t just a loss, it is a message,” Dabaja said. “His story is a story that needs to be told to the whole world.” CNN’s Jennifer Hansler and Kara Fox contributed to this report."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) this week launched the operation following intelligence that it said showed “the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.” In practice, the renewed offensive has been far more widespread than the Jabalya refugee camp . Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired general Giora Eiland. But the operation currently underway bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. A former senior military official who is aware of the Israeli government and security leadership’s thinking – though not directly involved in decision-making – told CNN that the cabinet had adopted “a version of” Eiland’s proposal, which has come to be known as “The General’s Plan.” Eiland told CNN the claim was “quite true” but said there were significant differences between his proposal and what was being implemented on the ground. The operation comes at a time when the Israeli government is known to be considering several plans to reset the war in Gaza.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters Related live-story The latest on the wars in the Middle East Eiland last month proposed forcing all civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, and then cutting off all supplies to the area. The goal, he said, was to force a reset in the war and upend Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s calculus. “The reality today in Gaza is that Sinwar is really not stressed,” he said in a video released at the time. The former military official who spoke to CNN said that “what was adopted [by the government] was the need to do more in Gaza, to change the way Sinwar is thinking. It was adopted without any way that may be conceived a violation of international law.” Eiland’s proposal had no plan to allow Gazan civilians to return to northern Gaza, Retired Major-General Gershon Hacohen, who was involved in its drafting, told CNN. That situation would seem certain to draw accusations of ethnic cleansing, something that has already been raised by academics like Omer Bartov, an Israeli-born professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University in Rhode Island. Flyer issued by the IDF warning residents of northern Gaza to move south. Obtained by CNN Eiland told CNN by text message that the cabinet is “indeed acting on my recommendation with the intention of taking control of the northern Gaza Strip, but I recommended implementing a siege (after evacuating the civilians) and stopping the entry of supplies into this area. None of this is happening.” On Monday, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered all Palestinians in Gaza’s northern-most communities – Beit Hanoun, Jabalya, and Beit Lahia – to leave and relocate to Al Mawasi, an Israel-declared “humanitarian area” in southern Gaza that has nonetheless come under intense aerial bombardment for months. The military on Saturday added additional mandatory evacuation zones, dropping flyers and posting on X, ordering people in the Nazla area and more areas of Jabalya to leave. The military “is operating with great force against terrorist organizations and will continue to do so for an extended period,” Avichay Adraee said on X. “You must evacuate the area immediately via Salah al-Din Street to the humanitarian zone.” Most intense action Supplies of food into northern Gaza, already meager, appear to have almost entirely stopped since the Israeli military began its renewed operation there this week. The World Food Programme told CNN on Friday that no food trucks had entered northern Gaza since the start of the month. “Virtually the entire area is under evacuation orders, and thousands of families have been forced to flee amid intense airstrikes and military operations on the ground,” WFP said in a statement on Wednesday . “With the main aid crossings into northern Gaza closed and WFP-partner kitchens forced to shut down, WFP is no longer able to distribute food in any form to families that desperately need it.” CNN asked the IDF for comment on aid deliveries being blocked. Netanyahu told a closed-door Knesset committee last month that the Generals’ Plan “makes a lot of sense,” according to national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate. He said that it was one of several ideas being considered to change the course of the war in Gaza, which is now in its second year. Palestinians in northern Gaza say that this week has brought some of the most intense military action of the war. Many, wary of repeated orders over the past year to move to areas of Gaza that then themselves come under attack, are ignoring the order. “Anyone who wants to leave the north to Gaza wants death,” Jabalya resident Mohammad Ibrahim told CNN by phone this week. Palestinians fleeing the renewed operation have been shot at as they evacuate, according to residents there and footage shared with CNN documenting their journey. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Palestinians flee with the few belongings they can carry following an Israeli attack on Jabalya camp on October 8.

They are working at minimum capacity and are exhausted. Even the safe places are bombed with shells and rockets.” Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility was informed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Tuesday that medical staff and patients must evacuate the hospital “within 24 hours.” They were not told where to go, he said. Al Awda and the Indonesian hospitals have also been ordered to leave, according to local officials. Hospital officials say Israel’s intense bombardment of the area makes it impossible to leave safely. Meanwhile, seven attempts this week by the World Health Organization to reach northern Gaza were “denied or impeded,” Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday. “The team was unable to carry out the medical evacuation of critical patients from Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals to Al-Ahli and Al-Shifa, due to delays of over 10 hours at checkpoints,” he said in a statement on X.

Fierce border clashes suggest a win won’t be easy,"The reality on the ground indicates Israel may be preparing for the possibility of a much bigger war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. If so, the fight could get bloody.","Oct 12, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Ivana Kottasová,Middle East,"Northern Israel CNN — The Ziv hospital in northern Israel is on high alert. Non-urgent operations are on hold, staff have been asked to consider donating blood when needed, and all patients – including newborns in the maternity unit – have been moved underground. The expectation here is clear: If Israel ends up sending more troops to southern Lebanon, it could get bloody. “We have been in a war situation for the past year, but after the army entered into Lebanon, our services and all of the staff are ready for, unfortunately, the next wave of casualties,” the hospital’s director, Salman Zarka, told CNN. Ziv Medical Center is the only hospital in the area and the closest to Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, as well as the occupied Golan Heights. The hospital in Safed has been receiving people injured in cross-border fire for months, including children hurt in the deadly attack on Majdal Shams in July. “When you have combat on the ground, usually you have more wounded and, unfortunately, dead soldiers. I hope it will not happen, (but) we have to be ready,” Zarka, an IDF reservist and a former commander of the IDF’s Medical Services Center, added. When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a ground operation against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon last week, its commanders insisted any action across the border would be “limited” in both geographical scope and duration. But the reality on the ground indicates it might be preparing for the possibility of a much bigger war. Prof. Salman Zarka, director of the Ziv Medical Center, told CNN the hospital is ready for the possibility that it may start receiving more casualties. Ivana Kottasova/CNN The IDF said on Tuesday that units from four divisions are now fighting in southern Lebanon. The force doesn’t disclose its troop numbers, but each division is thought to consist of some 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers. Israel has also broadened evacuation orders to roughly a quarter of Lebanese territory, with more than 1.2 million people now displaced, according to the United Nations. Daniel Sobelman, an international security expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the IDF has remained intentionally vague about the scope of the operation. “Initially, Israel said this is just to make sure that all the (Hezbollah) infrastructure on the other side of the fence is destroyed,” he said. “But the thing that we all know is that this infrastructure doesn’t stop a few hundreds of meters or even a few kilometers in, it stretches out all the way to Beirut, into northern Lebanon, into the Beqaa Valley. If Israel really wants to clean up that area, then we would be looking at a very long-term operation,” he said.

The 2006 conflict is known in Israel as the “Second Lebanon War” even though it was the third time Israel publicly said it entered Lebanon’s territory, after invading it in 1978 and 1982. The war ended in a stalemate after 34 days, after some 1,100 Lebanese and about 170 Israelis, including 120 soldiers, were killed. For the Lebanese, the current conflict is already bloodier than the last war. More than 1,500 people have been killed in the country since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements. Several international organizations have criticized Israel for the escalation. The UN said last month that “while Hezbollah has fired more missiles indiscriminately, forcing thousands of Israelis to leave their homes, Israel has escalated its indiscriminate and large-scale airstrikes across Lebanon,” warning that the increased violence “adds to the instability.” And while the casualties on the Israeli side are much lower and mostly limited to military, they are not insignificant: At least 14 IDF soldiers have been killed. Zarka told CNN there has also been a steady stream of injured soldiers coming to the hospital since the ground operation started – the hospital received well over 100 in just the first few days, he said. Both the IDF and Hezbollah said there had been fierce clashes and several cross-border attacks in the past week.

At the same time, Hezbollah continues to fire rockets into Israel on a regular basis. And while most of the projectiles are intercepted by Israeli air defense systems, some slip through. On Wednesday, two Israeli civilians were killed when a rocket struck Kiryat Shmona, a town a few miles away from the border. Several Israeli soldiers who are currently fighting in Lebanon told CNN the open, mountainous terrain where their enemy is at home makes the operation difficult. One soldier, who was deployed to Gaza from October to March and in July and August and who is now fighting in southern Lebanon, said the war along the northern border is very different to what he experienced in Gaza. “The challenge is not that Hezbollah is more equipped by Iran or have more training. The challenge is the switch in the head from months of fighting in an urban territory versus fighting in an open area territory,” he said, adding that even the most basic maneuvers – including the way soldiers move around in a column – are completely different. Since IDF troops are not allowed to speak to the media without official permission, CNN is not publishing the name of the soldier. Guerilla warfare On paper, Israel’s army is far superior to Hezbollah’s militia fighters. It has more advanced and sophisticated weapons, a significantly higher number of troops, better intelligence and stronger allies. But the soldier who spoke with CNN said these advantages don’t count for much in the type of fighting that is going on in the hills of southern Lebanon, where superior weaponry counts for less. Sobelman, the security expert, said Israel had a similar experience in the 2006 w ar with Hezbollah. UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix speaks during a UN Security Council meeting on October 10, 2024. UNTV Related article Peacekeepers’ safety in Lebanon ‘in jeopardy,’ UN official warns after Israeli fire injures two “Hezbollah were up against the strongest military in the Middle East, there were literally hundreds of Israeli air raids per day, and artillery, and all the capabilities that a modern, advanced military has to offer. And they were not defeated. They survived. And throughout the entire Israeli offensive, Hezbollah was able to fire hundreds of rockets into Israel every day,” he said. Sobelman said that after the 2006 fiasco, Israel had spent almost two decades preparing for its next confrontation with Hezbollah. “The assumption has been that the next war is going to be with Hezbollah, not Hamas. No one on Earth probably imagined a scenario along the lines of October 7. Instead, Israel invested almost two decades preparing itself for what we’ve seen over the past several weeks – and in terms of Israel’s intelligence penetration of Hezbollah, it’s astounding.” But while Israel has managed to kill several of Hezbollah’s top figures and inflicted much damage on the group’s rank-and-file members using exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, as well as airstrikes that have also claimed civilian lives, the IDF continues to face fierce resistance in southern Lebanon. Because Hezbollah has been preparing for this war as well. “The expectation is that Israel will win this war without paying too high a price. But that’s never the case with guerilla warfare,” Sobelman said, adding that Israel is fighting on a territory that Hezbollah knows much better and that its opponent is determined to inflict as many losses on the IDF as possible. “They’re entrenched in underground facilities and they’re playing a defensive game,” he said of Hezbollah’s fighters. “And it doesn’t matter how many of them you kill, still (in a guerilla war) the weaker side ultimately wins by imposing a sustained accumulation of costs.” He said this is exactly what happened in 2006, when Israel was not able to achieve a decisive victory despite its superior capabilities. While the IDF has not provided any details about how its troops died in Lebanon, Hezbollah has claimed to have successfully ambushed Israeli soldiers on several occasions, saying it killed and injured a number of them. Soldiers, including several visibly injured, are seen at the emergency department’s reception desk at the Ziv Medical Center. Ivana Kottasova/CNN ‘Bring it on’ Despite the challenges, the IDF seems determined to push on. Speaking on Wednesday, IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Israel would “strike Hezbollah with intensity, without allowing them any respite or recovery.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went as far as warning the Lebanese people that they face falling “into the abyss of a long war” because of Hezbollah. Israeli soldiers on the ground seem prepared for a long war. “I wish we didn’t have to expand the scope of the ground incursion… but if we have to fight so that the children can go to kindergarten and not be afraid of a missile strike, we will do that too,” the soldier who spoke with CNN said, adding that he and his fellow fighters were “stronger than ever, ready and determined.” This sentiment seemed prevalent among the dozens of Israeli soldiers CNN encountered while reporting from around the border after the IDF announced the ground operation. Most troops appeared in high spirits in the days after the ground operation began. When asked about Hezbollah specifically, one group responded by calling out “Bring it on!” But some in Israeli society are not so sure going into Lebanon is a good idea. Several civilians living in the northern parts of Israel told CNN last week that they fear a ground war could become very deadly . And some, like Itamar Greenberg, are prepared to go to prison in protest against the war. The 18-year-old is a conscientious objector, or “refusenik.” Conscription is mandatory for most Israeli citizens, men and women, and only a few young people dare to refuse on moral basis. A handful end up in prison each year. IDF “refusenik” Itamar Greenberg is set to begin serving his third prison sentence next week. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Greenberg has spent 60 days in prison so far – 30 days after his initial draft rejection and 30 days after he was called up a second time and refused again. CNN spoke to him in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, four days before he was scheduled to go back to prison after refusing to enlist for the third time. Before the IDF attempted to draft him, Greenberg was an activist campaigning against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and against increasingly violent attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages. Some of these protests turned violent after Israeli security authorities got involved – clearly leaving a mark on Greenberg. When a police car drove past, its sirens on, he flinched and looked around with worry. Greenberg told CNN he had refused to enlist in the army in protest of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, its war in Gaza and, most recently, its operation in Lebanon. “The war in Lebanon started when I was in jail. I joked that I didn’t even have the time to refuse all their f**king wars,” he noted. He was born in 2006, the year of the Second Lebanon War – a coincidence that is not lost on him. “The first (Israeli) soldiers have now been killed in the Third Lebanon War and the children who will fight in the Fourth Lebanon War are being born now,” he said. “This war is creating the next war. The children that see their family die will not stop. I am pretty sure, based on the history, they will choose resistance and violence. It’s sad, but it’s the reality.” CNN’s Zeena Saifi contributed to this report."

Iran’s anxiety stems from uncertainty about whether the US can convince Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites and oil facilities, and the fact that its most important proxy militia in the region, Hezbollah, has been significantly weakened by Israeli military operations in recent weeks, the sources said. The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months , telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.” The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, have also expressed concern to the US about a potential attack on Iranian oil facilities, which could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN. The Biden administration is deeply worried that the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between Iran and Israel, which began earlier this year after Israel struck what Iran said was its consulate building in Damascus, could spiral into a major regional war that pulls the US in, too. A major part of the fears is that the US’ influence with Israel has appeared to be steadily waning over the last year. Similarly to its operations in Gaza, Israel has increasingly disregarded the US’ calls for more restraint in Lebanon, where Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground offensive has killed over 1,400 people since late last month. Israel also did not consult with the US before conducting a massive attack that exploded thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah operatives last month, or before assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and upending a delicate ceasefire proposal that had been put forward by the US and France less than 48 hours earlier. Israel’s security cabinet has not yet reached a decision on how to proceed, an Israeli official told CNN on Friday. And while the gap between the US and Israeli positions is narrowing, it may not remain that way, a US official said. “We can’t actually know whether they voted or not,” a senior administration official said of the Israeli cabinet’s discussions, expressing skepticism over the level of transparency about what Israel is sharing with the US. The official suggested they can’t “put too much stock in the machinations” of the Israeli government. As of last week, Israel had not given any assurances that it would not target Iran’s nuclear facilities, CNN reported. Israel has for decades been planning attacks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and just two years ago simulated striking them in a military exercise. Israel is also suspected of carrying out assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years, and Iran’s nuclear facilities have come under siege from cyberattacks, likely from Israel—the most famous being the Stuxnet virus, which was able to penetrate Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility. ‘Our strike will be powerful’ Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a strong warning to Iran about his country’s response on Wednesday. “Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,” Gallant said. The Gulf states, broadly, are eager to stay on the sidelines of the conflict, the Arab diplomat said. While Iran has publicly warned that any parties seen as aiding Israel will be treated as aggressors, it is also unlikely that Iran’s neighbors would explicitly come to Tehran’s defense in the event of an Israeli attack. But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have told both the US and Iran that they will not allow Israel to use their airspace to strike Iran, the Arab diplomat and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. Jordan also will protect its airspace from any unauthorized intrusion, regardless of the origin, a Jordanian official said. The US does not believe that Iran wants to become entangled in a full-scale war with Israel, and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera this week that Netanyahu “is the only one who wants a war and to set the region on fire to stay in power.” But the US has still urged Tehran, through backchannels, to calibrate its response if Israel attacks, an official said. While Qatar regularly speaks to the Iranians and relays back to the US what they say, the US official said that ultimately “we just do not know what [Iran] will do.” Key voices within Iran will have different ideas about if and how to respond to Israel, but that will depend on the scale and scope of the highly anticipated Israeli move, another US official said. This official said that messaging from Iran has been consistent both publicly and privately since Tehran launched its barrage of missiles at Israel earlier this month and there has not been a significant change in messaging. Iran has been particularly interested in getting help from Saudi Arabia in preventing an Israeli attack and using their influence with Washington to help find a solution to the crisis, the Arab diplomat told CNN. Officials from each country have met three times in less than a month, and Araghchi traveled to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to “consult on regional developments” and to “try to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon and Gaza,” he told local media. The world is watching Israel’s every move as it contemplates how to respond. But at least until Saturday at sundown, Israel will be at a standstill to mark Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and the holiest day of the year in Judaism. And though it’s not impossible Israel might launch action, shops, restaurants and other services will be closed, public transport will not be operating and even the country’s main airport — the Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv — will be shut down.

Israel’s actions in the besieged Palestinian enclave “constitute the war crimes of willful killing and mistreatment and the crime against humanity of extermination,” the commission said in a statement Thursday. “Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles” in Gaza, according to the report by the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. The Israeli attacks resulted in “fuel, food, water, medicines and medical supplies not reaching hospitals, while also drastically reducing permits for patients to leave the territory for medical treatment,” it said.

REUTERS/Ramadan Abed Ramadan Abed/Reuters Related article Israeli strike kills at least 28 Palestinians at school in central Gaza, Red Crescent says The Israeli foreign ministry called the accusations “outrageous” and said they were “another blatant attempt by the (commission) to delegitimize the very existence of the State of Israel and obstruct its right to protect its population while covering up the crimes of terrorist organizations.” “This report shamelessly portrays Israel’s operations in terror-infested health facilities in Gaza as a matter of policy against Gaza’s health system, while entirely dismissing overwhelming evidence that medical facilities in Gaza have been systematically used by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad for terrorist activities.” Hamas, it said, uses medical facilities to conceal operatives, store weapons, conduct attacks and hide hostages. Hamas has repeatedly denied that it uses hospitals for military activity. The UN report also accused Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups of committing war crimes of “torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, rape and sexual violence” for their treatment of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza. It also investigated “institutionalized mistreatment” of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. The Israeli foreign ministry rejected “accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees,” saying Israel is “fully committed to international legal standards” on treatment of detainees. In a statement accompanying the 24-page report, which does not have the force of law, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Israel “must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction” in Gaza. “Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,” she said. CNN Related card Flattened in a year: How Israeli bombardment reduced most of Gaza to rubble As part of the report, UN experts investigated the killing of 5-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab , who made headlines in late January after a recording emerged of her pleading to emergency workers to rescue her and her family after they became trapped in their car due to Israeli shelling. Despite an ambulance arriving at the scene while the girl was still alive, the presence of Israeli security forces effectively “prevented access,” meaning the bodies of Rajab’s relatives “could not be retrieved from their bullet-ridden car until 12 days after the incident,” the report said. The report “determined on reasonable grounds that the Israeli Army’s 162nd Division” which operated in the area at the time is “responsible for killing the family of seven, shelling the ambulance and killing the two paramedics inside.” The incident was just one of several alleged attacks on health care in Gaza, amid broader wartime conditions. The report will be presented to the UN General Assembly on October 30. The commission previously alleged that both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in the early stages of the Gaza war, and that Israel’s actions also amounted to crimes against humanity.

Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Lacroix described hostilities between Israeli forces and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon as “increasingly alarming,” and putting “peacekeepers at serious risk.” “The safety and security of peacekeepers is now increasingly in jeopardy,” Lacroix said. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reported early Thursday that the peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli tank fired toward an observation tower at its headquarters in the southern Lebanese city Naqoura. The Israeli tank fire directly hit the tower, causing the peacekeepers to fall, UNIFIL said, adding that other “nearby positions have been repeatedly hit.” UNFIL said that “any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have accused Hezbollah of operating in areas near UNIFIL posts, and said in a statement that it had asked UNIFIL forces to “remain in protected spaces” during the incident. Clipped From Video video Related video CNN reports from deserted Lebanese beach “The IDF is operating in southern Lebanon and maintains routine communication with UNIFIL,” the IDF said in a statement after Thursday’s incident. “This morning (Thursday), IDF troops operated in the area of Naqoura, next to a UNIFIL base. Accordingly, the IDF instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area,” the statement added. UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said the two peacekeepers – both Indonesian – were hospitalized. Their injuries are not serious, he said. UN peacekeepers have been stationed in southern Lebanon since 2006 , per a mandate by the United Nations Security Council. UN peacekeepers were drawn from armies of several nations to monitor the situation along the roughly 120-kilometer (74-mile) Blue Line which separates the two states. The incident came as Israel expands its strikes across Lebanon. On Thursday, Israeli strikes on a densely populated Beirut neighborhood killed at least 22 people and wounded 117, the Lebanese health ministry said. A senior Hezbollah official was the target of the attack, according to a source in the militant group and Israeli media reports. Wafiq Safa, leader of Hezbollah’s liaison unit, survived the assassination attempt, the Hezbollah source told CNN. Israel has not publicly claimed Thursday’s strikes or confirmed any targets. International outcry The injury of the UN peacekeepers drew condemnation from several countries including Italy, France, and Ireland, who all have contingents in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni summoned the Israeli ambassador in Rome on Thursday after what she described as “unacceptable” behavior by the Israeli forces. Meloni’s office said two Italian bases of UNIFIL were “hit by gunfire from the Israeli army” on Thursday and added that the prime minister spoke to the Commander of the Western Sector of the UNIFIL mission, Gen. Stefano Messina, for an update on the safety of the Italian troops. The Italian leader also contacted Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to “firmly remind” him that “what is happening near the Italian UNIFIL bases in southern Lebanon” is “unacceptable,” according to an Italian government statement. Indonesia’s mission to the UN blasted Israel over what it called “deliberate attacks,” saying Friday that Israel’s actions “represent a blatant attempt to spread terror on the ground to intimidate both the peacekeeping mission and international community.” France also expressed “deep concern” after the attack, saying it was “awaiting explanations from the Israeli authorities.” “The protection of peacekeepers is an obligation imposed on all parties to a conflict. France calls on the parties to respect this obligation, and to allow UNIFIL to continue to implement its mandate, including by respecting its freedom of movement,” a spokesperson for the French foreign ministry said. Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin described the IDF’s “targeting & firing on UNIFIL positions” as “reprehensible” and “unacceptable.” Earlier this week, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris also expressed concern after Israeli tanks were stationed close to an UN outpost manned by Irish peacekeepers. The European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell condemned what he called an “inadmissible act,” posting to X: “Another line has been dangerously crossed in Lebanon: IDF shelling of UN peacekeepers whose positions are known. We condemn this inadmissible act, for which there is no justification.” The EU foreign policy chief reiterated his support for UNIFIL and called for full accountability regarding the incident.

The attack on the Rafidah school injured at least 54 Palestinians, according to the Red Crescent. Hospital officials have confirmed the death toll. The Israeli military said it struck “terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center” at the school compound, saying “numerous steps” were taken to protect civilians. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. CNN footage showed children being carried into ambulances, their faces covered with blood, and many of them screaming and crying. One girl lay on the hospital floor, wearing only underpants, shaking and covered in blood, with severe burns on her body. “Am I going to die?” the girl asked medical workers at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. “What happened?” The strike tore down the walls of the school, covering its rooms with blackened debris. Responders and survivors dug through the wreckage trying to recover bodies. Ayman Abou Khousa, a displaced Palestinian who was sheltering at the school, said the attack came “by surprise,” and he is now still looking for his relatives under the rubble. CNN Related card Flattened in a year: How Israeli bombardment reduced most of Gaza to rubble “We are dying every day,” he told CNN. “The world has sold us out… every day you (journalists) come here and film us. You’ve been filming us for a year,” Khousa said, adding that Gazans are still forced to dig for their dead with their bare hands. Another man working to recover bodies said that survivors are looking for their relatives “in pieces,” as the attack scattered their remains. Footage from the site showed some of those killed being moved in pieces, with limbs gathered in bedsheets and blankets by survivors. “Why are they hitting the school? It is all displaced people, mostly women,” Iftekhar Hammouda, another woman who was sheltering at the school, said, adding that “there is no Hamas” there. “Where can people go? Where do they flee? They hit us at our homes, at our tents, on the streets and at the schools,” Hammouda added. Thursday’s strike is the latest to hit a school in Gaza. Last month, an Israeli strike on a school compound near Gaza city, killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials. Israel said it targeted Hamas fighters sheltering there. In August, local officials said that more than 90 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school and mosque in Al-Tabi’in compound in the Al-Daraj neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City, where displaced people were sheltering. Israel confirmed it carried out the strike, saying it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters. Israel has renewed its military operation in some parts of Gaza, saying it is targeting attempts by Hamas to regroup, and has ordered mass evacuations of multiple neighborhoods across the enclave. The latest strike comes as Gaza’s health ministry reported more than 42,000 people killed in the besieged territory since the war began a year ago following the Hamas attacks of October 7, and as Israel presses on with a ground incursion into Lebanon while weighing an attack on Iran.

Iran launched dozens of missiles towards Israel on October 1 in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others in Lebanon. The missiles had to pass through Iraq’s airspace to reach Israel. Air France Flight AF662 was flying over Iraq when the Iranian attack began at around 4:45 p.m. UTC (11.45 a.m. ET) and left Iraqi airspace “shortly before” 5 p.m. UTC (12 p.m. ET), the airline told CNN in a statement. Iraqi airspace was not officially closed by local authorities until 5:56 p.m. UTC (12:56 p.m. ET), it added. “Thanks to the information we gathered we were able to identify a forthcoming attack on Israel by Iran, involving the launch of ballistic missiles,” Air France said. “As a result, and without waiting for instructions from the Iraqi authorities, Air France decided to suspend the overflight of the country’s airspace by its aircraft from 5 p.m. UTC [12 p.m. ET],” it added.

He certainly didn’t go to Gaza as president , and CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post have all found no proof he made a prior visit. Perhaps he merely meant he has been to Palestinian territory, since he did visit the West Bank in 2017 ? Or maybe he was just talking about having been to the broader region? Nope. Trump’s campaign said Monday night that he meant what he said about having been to Gaza in particular – and the campaign insisted the claim is true. “President Trump has been to Gaza previously and has always worked to ensure peace in the Middle East,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN. Leavitt, though, did not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed trip to Gaza. And she did not respond when we repeatedly asked for even the most basic information, like the year of the supposed visit. So we were highly skeptical – because Trump has a long history of making things up , because of the lack of public evidence, because the Times of Israel has reported that Trump had never even visited Israel before his presidency, and because the Trump campaign had offered a substantively different comment to The New York Times earlier Monday. That earlier comment , which a campaign official provided only on condition of anonymity, did not say Trump had actually been to Gaza. Instead, the anonymous campaign official tried some spin, correctly saying that Trump has been to Israel but wrongly saying, “Gaza is in Israel.” We asked three former Trump officials who worked on Middle East policy whether they know of any proof for the former president’s claim, and the campaign’s claim to CNN, that Trump has been to Gaza itself. The only one who has responded, Trump-appointed former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker , said in an email: “As far as I know, he’s never traveled there. He did not go in 2017 when he visited Israel. I think this story is probably already over.” Another wild goose chase For years, Trump’s uncorroborated stories have sent us on fact-check wild goose chases – seeking everything from proof that he was years ago named “Man of the Year” in Michigan ( he wasn’t ) to proof that something terrible related to immigration had happened “last night in Sweden” in 2017 ( nothing had happened ). This new hunt was equally fruitless. Trump aides told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that the former president privately said he did indeed to go to Gaza and that his comment in the Monday interview was not a mistake. But those aides were unable to provide any details about his alleged trip, including when he traveled, why he went or who he was with. David Friedman, who served as Trump’s ambassador to Israel, and Jason Greenblatt, a former Trump Organization executive who became Trump’s special representative for international negotiations, did not immediately respond Tuesday to our requests for comment. And since we were determined to give Trump associates and supporters every possible opportunity to substantiate the claim, we also took the rare step late Monday night of putting out a public request on X for any corroborating information. As of noon on Tuesday, nobody had replied with any. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Alayna Treene contributed to this report ."

Mohammad Sultan, 28, said he and his family fled their house in Jabalya in northern Gaza “due to the intense and continuous bombardments in the area.” When he went back to retrieve food, water and blankets, he and other civilians were fired at, he said. “Drones were firing at everyone passing by on the road,” Sultan told CNN. “Three people were shot right in front of me. My brother and I tried to help the injured get to the hospitals, but a little girl was shot in the neck, and her father was also injured.” The shooting took place at Abu Sharkh roundabout in Jabalya, according to Sultan. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. Footage taken by Sultan during his journey shows residents walking along a sandy road, surrounded by rubble and half-destroyed buildings. Some, including children, are on foot, struggling to walk with heavy bags. Others are on bicycles or tuk-tuks.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters Related article A year into the war, Israeli military operations in Gaza continue to ramp up and Hamas is yet to be defeated The Israeli military on Monday issued fresh evacuation orders in both northern and southern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering. In northern Gaza, the military said it is “currently operating with great force in the area” and told residents to move to Al Mawasi, a southern region designated as a so-called humanitarian zone that is already crammed with refugees. A day earlier, Israel’s military said it had encircled Jabalya as it launched a new ground operation there amid efforts by Hamas to “rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.” Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said on Monday it was engaged in “fierce fights” with Israeli forces in northern Gaza. Flyers were dropped by the Israeli military over Jabalya Tuesday morning, “urgently” warning residents to “evacuate immediately,” residents told CNN. The renewed fighting comes on the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Gunfire at ‘anything that moves’ Hassan Hamad, a resident of Jabalya, was killed this week in his home in Jabalya, his aunt Itaf told CNN. She decided to stay in the city to collect his remains and give him a dignified burial. After months of documenting Israel’s offensive in Jabalya,18-year-old Hamad was killed when his family’s apartment was hit in an Israeli missile attack in the city’s refugee camp on Sunday, according to witness testimony and footage shared with CNN. Gunfire and shelling have stopped his aunt from leaving the house in search of her nephew’s remains, which were scattered around the area after the assault, she told CNN. “We stayed in the house to search for the remaining body parts of Hassan, but now we cannot go out due to the intensity of the shelling and gunfire,” the 58-year-old said, adding the gunfire targets “anything that moves.” The Jabalya refugee camp has been left in ruins by repeated Israeli attacks. Mahmoud ssa/Anadolu/Getty Images Itaf spoke to CNN on the phone from her home in Jabalya, where shelling could be heard in the background. “We try to stay away from the windows, so they won’t shoot at us,” she said. Residents say the fighting in Jabalya has been some of the most intense in recent days. Mohammad Ibrahim, a resident of the city who decided to stay in his home with his two sons, said the explosions outside his house were so intense they “shook” his body. “I felt as though my body was tearing apart,” Ibrahim told CNN, adding that the firing is more intense than it was at the outset of the war. From his window, Ibrahim said he could see smoke billowing between abandoned apartment buildings. “Anyone who wants to leave the north to Gaza wants death,” he said. Jabalya has been targeted several times during the war, and like many other parts of Gaza, its residents say they don’t know where to go for shelter. “We are living in the Stone Age,” Ibrahim said. “There is no conscience, no humanity, no human rights.”"

Once the ceasefire is firmly established and diplomacy can reach it, all other details will be discussed and decisions will be made collaboratively,” Deputy Secretery General Naim Qassem said. AFP video Related video Massive Israeli airstrikes hit 120 targets in Lebanon. See video of explosion in Beirut Lebanon’s Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8 last year to show solidarity with Hamas, which had launched an attack on Israel from Gaza a day earlier. Hezbollah had previously stated that it would only cease its attacks on Israel once a ceasefire was reached with Hamas in Gaza. Israel, however, insisted that Hezbollah separate its conflict with Israel from the ongoing war with Hamas. In his speech marking the first anniversary of Hezbollah’s involvement in the war, Qassem did not mention a Gaza ceasefire as a condition for achieving one in Lebanon. It was Qassem’s second speech since Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah late last month. Israel has since been conducting limited ground incursions into southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, which has continued to fire rockets into northern Israel. Nabih Berri, the leader of the Shiite Amal party that is allied with Hezbollah, has been a key figure in negotiations for a ceasefire mediated by Western nations. Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN last week that Nasrallah had agreed to a temporary ceasefire that was called for by US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and other allies during last month’s UN General Assembly. Soon after, Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel. US officials have told CNN that the Biden administration isn’t actively trying to revive the deal and has resigned itself to trying to shape and limit Israeli operations in Lebanon and against Iran rather than halting hostilities. Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, said in an interview with Sky News on Sunday that Nasrallah hadn’t agreed to a ceasefire and called Bou Habib’s claim “ridiculous.” Smoke rises in Beirut's southern suburbs after a strike, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, as seen from Hadath, Lebanon on Tuesday. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters ‘Abyss of a long war’ In a video message on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has “eliminated” Hashem Safieddine , the successor to Nasrallah. However, the Israeli military said it is still checking whether a strike on Hezbollah intelligence headquarters in Beirut killed him. Netanyahu addressed the people of Lebanon directly in the message, urging them to stand up to Hezbollah and “take back your country,” and threatening them with a Gaza style war if they do not. “Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites alike – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will bring destruction and suffering similar to what we see in Gaza,” he continued. Israel’s war on Hezbollah has killed more than 1,400 people in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have said. Despite the nod to ceasefire talks, much of Qassem’s speech on Tuesday carried a defiant tone, emphasizing Hezbollah’s readiness and capability to continue its fight against Israel. “If the enemy continues its war, then the battlefield will be decisive, and the battlefield belongs to us” he said. Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched a large barrage of rockets toward the Israeli cities of Haifa and Kiryat, one of the largest on the city since the start of the war. The rockets were fired from Lebanon in two separate barrages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. While numerous rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military, at least two buildings in Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin were directly hit, it said.

On Monday, as Israel marked a year since Hamas’ October 7 attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “continue to fight” and achieve the country’s war goals, including toppling Hamas and “eliminating any future threat from Gaza to Israel.” The same day, the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders in both northern and southern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering. In northern Gaza, the military said it is “currently operating with great force in the area” and told residents to move to Al Mawasi, a southern region designated as a so-called humanitarian zone that is already crammed with refugees. A new military ground operation was launched on Sunday in Jabalya, northern Gaza, where the military said it is encircling the area after it saw signs of Hamas rebuilding. Earlier this year, Israel’s military said it had defeated Hamas in northern Gaza, only to announce new operations there in May. Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters are engaged “in fierce clashes at zero distance with the enemy forces” in Jabalya, an indication the group has maintained a presence there to keep fighting. Casualties in the north have also mounted in recent days. Ahead of the Israeli military announcements Monday, hospitals said they had received five bodies and several injured people following Israeli “artillery fire” in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.

Footage from the scene showed multiple bodies lying in the street covered in blood. The strike happened about three hours after the Israeli military issued the evacuation order. About an hour after the first evacuation order, the military issued another directive to leave parts of southern Gaza near Khan Younis. The military said it was responding with “extreme force” to Hamas actions in the area and also called on Palestinians to evacuate to Al Mawasi. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are already sheltering in Al Mawasi after fleeing Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza. The new evacuation orders mean more people will be displaced yet again, and crammed into a very small area — worsening an already critical humanitarian situation. Lena, a worker for non-profit organization Mercy Corps, told CNN she had been displaced more than a dozen times since last year. CNN is not using her real name due to concerns for her safety. “We haven’t put our clothes in wardrobes, bathed comfortably, had a meal with any sense of peace, slept on a proper bed, or had clean drinking water in over a year,” said Lena, who now lives in a shelter in central Gaza. The Israel military said it intercepted five projectiles launched from northern Gaza on Monday. Earlier in the day, nine projectiles were launched from southern Gaza, injuring two people, the military said.

The woman and hundreds of others were reliving in real time the moment terrorists stormed the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel, marking the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks in which Hamas and other militant groups killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, taking them back into Gaza. The brutality of the attack on the festival shocked the world. As revelers danced and partied in the desert, scores of Hamas terrorists stormed the site, blocked off escape routes, and embarked on a killing spree. They ambushed groups trying to hide and murdered people as they tried to escape. They shot victims at point blank range in their cars and fired machine guns and anti-tank weapons indiscriminately at those who tried to flee on foot. Over the past year, the site of the massacre – a remote location just a few miles from the Gaza perimeter – has been turned into a memorial. Instead of the vast open space, there are now hundreds of near identical cenotaphs, each featuring the name and a picture of a victim. The family of Amit Itzhak David gathers at his memorial at the site of the attack on the Nova Music Festival.

To mark the anniversary of his death, his family huddled around the memorial on Monday, hugging each other and David’s picture. The 23-year-old was killed here last year, shortly after returning from a trip to South America, where he had been celebrating the end of his compulsory military service. David’s cousin Inbar Parnassa told CNN the family doesn’t come to the site often. “It’s too difficult to be here and see all of this,” she said. Parnassa and other members of the family were all wearing matching T-shirts embroidered with David’s name and the sign of the horns – his favorite gesture.

A music lover and a former junior wrestler, Amit too was murdered at the site. The Nova Music Festival massacre was by far the deadliest of the October 7 attacks, accounting for nearly a third of the victims. There were so many dead and kidnapped that it took Israeli authorities months to determine how many people had been killed there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday that 347 people, most of them young, died at the site and some 40 others were kidnapped. Gabriel Barel’s mother, three brothers, and a best friend from the army all turned up in matching tops featuring his photograph. Barel’s brother Yeoda said the family initially believed he might have survived the attack and been taken to Gaza. People pray for the victims of the October 7 terror attack at the site of the Nova Music Festival. Ivana Kottasova/CNN But a few weeks later their hopes were crushed when Barel’s body was found. After shooting Barel dead, his attackers had set his car on fire. His remains were so badly burnt it took many weeks for him to be identified. Witnesses to the massacre say other victims were raped and subjected to sexual violence by Hamas. Hamas has denied the accusations, but the evidence of sexual violence comes from different sources — survivors who witnessed the events, first responders, medical and forensic experts. The United Nations and the International Criminal Court have offered evidence that Hamas attackers committed sexual crimes. War rages on Monday marked the first anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks, and a year since Israel began its war against the militant group in Gaza. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then. The war has sparked a major humanitarian disaster, displacing nearly all of the strip’s 2.2 million residents. As people gathered across Israel, the reminders that the war in Gaza is still raging kept coming. Throughout the morning, loud booms of outgoing fire reverberated throughout southern Israel as the IDF hit targets in the Gaza strip.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN Israel has said its goal in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and bring back the remaining hostages, but neither has been achieved. Indeed, as the anniversary events got under way, several rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel, injuring two people. While increasingly rare, rocket launches such as these show that even after a year of intense war, militants in Gaza are still able to strike Israel. During a memorial service in kibbutz Nir Oz , the smoke trail of the rockets fired from Gaza was clearly visible in the sky.

Yehud was a volunteer medic at Nir Oz and when he realized the kibbutz was under attack and there were wounded, he rushed out to provide help. He was killed, but his remains were not found and identified until June. Yehud’s pregnant wife Sigal and three children survived the massacre. His fourth child was born just nine days later. Yehud’s sister Arbel was kidnapped and taken to Gaza with her boyfriend Ariel Cunio, alongside Cunio’s brother David, David’s wife Sharon Alony Cunio, and their three-year-old twin daughters. Alony Cunio and the two girls were released during a ceasefire deal agreed in November, but the rest of the group remains in captivity. “Dolev’s sister is still in Gaza. She’s one of the four or five civilian women still there alive. The most important thing now is to bring her and the rest of them back,” he said. Lifshitz grew up in the kibbutz and while he left at 16, he still has deep links there. His grandparents Oded and Yocheved were kidnapped from their homes in the kibbutz during the attack. Yocheved Lifshitz, who was 85 when kidnapped, spent more than two weeks in captivity. She was released alongside her neighbor and friend Nurit Cooper, 79, but both her and Cooper’s husbands were kept in Gaza. Nurit Cooper and her family were told in June that Amiram Cooper, her 84-year-old husband and one of the founders of the kibbutz, was no longer alive. His body is still in Gaza. “We cannot move on when people from the kibbutz are still there. Time stopped here,” Amat Moshe, whose grandparents were residents of the kibbutz, told CNN at the Nir Oz cemetery. Adina Moshe and her daughter Maya Shoshani Moshe mourn at the grave of Adina’s husband David. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Last October, Moshe’s grandmother Adina Moshe watched Hamas fighters storm her home and murder her husband David before kidnapping her and taking her to Gaza. She was released as part of a ceasefire deal in November last year. Sitting by David’s grave during the memorial ceremony on Monday, Adina was sobbing, her body slumped as if crushed by the horrors of the past year. Her daughter Maya Shoshani Moshe hurried to her side, trying to comfort her before bursting into tears herself. Moshe has previously spoken publicly about her ordeal in Gaza and has in the past made an emotional plea directly to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the remaining hostages back. Gershon Baskin says he is in touch with Hamas officials about a deal and all that the Israeli Prime Minister needs to do is “sign it.” Clipped From Video video Related video Former Israeli hostage negotiator pushes for Netanyahu to sign a ceasefire deal “Again, I am asking you, Mr. Netanyahu, everything is in your hands, you’re the one who can do it, and I’m extremely scared, that if you continue along this path…there won’t be any more hostages to release,” she said in February after Netanyahu rejected the terms of a ceasefire and hostage deal put forward by Hamas. She expressed the views of many Israelis who are furious with Netanyahu. Mass protests against the prime minister and his government have once again become a common occurrence across the country and the anger burst into the public view on several occasions during the memorial events on Monday. Early in the day, family members of the hostages marched to Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, blasting a siren for two minutes outside his front door. Netanyahu did not make an appearance at the event, or any other gatherings aside from a small ceremony in Jerusalem. When hundreds of people gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday evening to commemorate the victims of the attacks, politics was meant to be off limits. But it soon became clear that for many of the family members who were speaking at the event, politics is too intertwined with the fate of their loved ones. Jonathan Shimriz, the brother of Alon Shimriz who was taken hostage and later killed in Gaza during a failed rescue operation, called for a state inquiry into the handling of the hostage crisis. “There is no personal example, no vision, no leadership, no accountability,” he told the crowd."

The US’ inability to halt Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground invasion of Lebanon, which has killed over 1,400 people in less than three weeks and displaced over 1 million more, has raised questions about whether Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is disregarding the Biden administration’s calls for more restraint like it did in Gaza, leaving the White House again looking feckless. Concerns within the Biden administration are running high, officials say, that what Israel has promised would be a limited operation will soon grow into a larger-scale and prolonged conflict. US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have also floundered . As with Gaza, US officials say Israel was initially planning for a much larger ground incursion into Lebanon before the US convinced it to scale back. But they also acknowledge what they have learned over the last year, which is that the US’ influence is limited when it comes to Israel’s military operations. “We couldn’t stop them from taking action, but we can at least try to shape what it looks like,” one senior US official told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations. The ceasefire proposal , which the US put forward with France, had called for a 21-day pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah to give the sides space to work on a larger deal to return Israeli and Lebanese civilians to their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. “We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah’s infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah’s capability, but we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday. “And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.” Senior US officials have also acknowledged that the US has limited leverage over what Israel decides to do against Iran following Tehran’s missile attack last week. The US has been urging Israel not to be overly escalatory with a retaliatory strike, the official said. But they cautioned that what Israel sees as a proportional attack may not be in line with what the rest of the world — including the US — would consider to be a measured response. President Joe Biden said last week that he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities, but it is not clear whether the US has successfully persuaded Israel to take that option off the table. “The only leverage that the Americans have right now is summoning the defense minister to Washington and buying time,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is scheduled to meet with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Wednesday, a visit the Biden administration may hope buys time for consultations and planning before Israel carries out its promised retaliation against Iran. With Gallant in Washington, Pinkas says the US likely believes Israel will wait to attack. “This would make sense in a political science simulation game, not in Israeli politics,” Pinkas said. Netanyahu was in New York when Israel carried out the massive strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. An attack against Iran, though far more complicated than striking a neighboring country, could still be carried out with the defense minister abroad, Pinkas said, especially given the acrimonious relationship between Netanyahu and Gallant. Gallant said Israel is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but Israel will ultimately make its own decision about how it retaliates. “Everything is on the table,” Gallant told CNN on Sunday. ‘The right moment’ for diplomacy The US still wants to see Lebanon ceasefire talks resume, officials said, and US officials continue to believe that the conflict can only be resolved diplomatically. “We’re going to be having regular consultations with the Israelis, with the Lebanese and others, regarding the right moment to press for such an agreement,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday. But “the Israelis have to get beyond some things before we can revisit those conversations,” said one senior administration official. That official and another source said it is not even clear at this point who the US would be dealing with on any ceasefire talks. Nasrallah and other members of Hezbollah’s senior leadership are now dead as a result of Israel’s operations in Lebanon. And while one US official expressed hope that the Lebanese government could now exert more control over the militant group, the Lebanese state is experiencing a similar power vacuum, having been without a president or fully empowered Cabinet since October 2022. Austin said Friday that he believes the Lebanese government has an important opportunity  to demonstrate “that it wants to care for its people” and siphon support away from Hezbollah, particularly now that the group’s chain of command “has really been stripped away at the strategic and operational level.” But Israel’s punishing air campaign in Beirut could make it harder for a functioning Lebanese government to emerge from the rubble, one of the officials noted. “What’s going on in Beirut is not what we had wanted,” he said. Austin and other senior members of Biden’s national security team – including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines – convened in the Oval Office on September 30 for several hours, discussing Israel’s intensifying operations in Lebanon. Earlier in the day, a reluctant Biden told reporters he’d be “comfortable with [Israel] stopping” the campaign in Lebanon that risked further inflaming the region. Behind closed doors, sources say, Biden offered reluctant support for eliminating Hezbollah infrastructure along Israel’s border and in southern Lebanon, as long as Israel’s operations remained limited in nature. While the US has been generally supportive of that strategy, several officials including Austin have voiced concerns to Israel about mitigating civilian harm in its airstrikes —particularly in southern Beirut, a densely populated area where several residential buildings have been flattened in recent weeks. “The secretary has been very clear about the importance of taking civilian safety into account when planning and conducting operations, and that hasn’t changed,” Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Monday when asked whether he supports Israel’s operations in Beirut. “That continues to be a topic of discussion between [Austin] and Minister Gallant.” Israel says it is working to mitigate civilian casualties, noting that it has issued evacuation notices to Lebanese residents in recent days before conducting operations. But CNN teams in Beirut last week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. US officials are also concerned about the operations Israel is conducting so close to Beirut’s main airport, which could threaten the ability of American citizens to leave the country via the limited commercial options that remain. Ryder said the US is in discussions with Israel about the airport as it relates to the safety of Americans living in the country, and State Department spokesperson Miller said the US “has made clear” to Israel that it wants the roads to the airport in Beirut to “continue to be operational.” CNN’s MJ Lee and Alex Marquardt contributed reporting."

But the shocking terror attacks from Hamas — the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust — brought with it a flood of outside reporters and focus of the world as the ensuing war rages on and seemingly expands. In the year since the devastating war began, a record number of media workers have lost their lives, the vast majority as the result of the Israeli military’s bombardment of Gaza. Reporters have faced physical threats for their coverage and major obstacles in getting information out of the warzone - especially from Gaza. Journalists have also endured internal newsroom pressure and vitriolic attacks from readers and viewers over any perceived bias or error. The October 7 attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza has roiled the region like never before, challenging the news media’s coverage and upending the region’s politics and policy for generations to come. An ‘unprecedented’ toll The year since the war began has been the deadliest for media workers since most journalism and press freedom organizations have started tracking journalist deaths in conflict. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders , at least 128 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war, nearly all of them Palestinian media workers in Gaza killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes. Some of the journalists died while wearing protective gear identifying them as members of the press. Multiple news organizations and free press groups have accused the Israeli military of deliberately targeting journalists. RE'IM, ISRAEL - OCTOBER 07: Family and friends gather at the Nova festival memorial to mark the first anniversary since Hamas attacked one year ago on October 07, 2024 in Re'im, Israel. Various commemorations are taking place around Israel to mark the  anniversary of the Hamas attacks in Israel. On October 7, 2023, members of Hamas mounted a series of attacks and raids on Israeli citizens in the Gaza Envelope border area of Israel. 251 Israelis and foreigners were kidnapped with nearly 100 still unaccounted for and 1139 people were killed. (Photo by Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images) Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images Related live-story Israel marks anniversary of Hamas attacks as Middle East war rages “One year in, Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza has exacted an unprecedented and horrific toll on Palestinian journalists and the region’s media landscape,” CPJ said . The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not intentionally target journalists, but that it cannot guarantee the safety of reporters in an “active military zone” and has accused Hamas of deliberately placing military operations “in the vicinity of journalists and civilians.” It has also accused a handful of Palestinian journalists as having participated in the Oct. 7 attack or being members of Hamas, something the media organizations have largely and vehemently denied . But even excluding these accusations, the toll on media workers is astronomical. Many media organizations, including CNN, evacuated their full-time staff in the enclave with their families as soon as possible. Gaza was never an easy place to report from, between restrictions on entry and exit and pressure from Hamas against any inkling of dissent. But now, seemingly nowhere is safe, and the journalists who are left are operating in harsh conditions and having to contend with just surviving in an active war zone. “A few brave Palestinian journalists in Gaza have continued to work for international media, braving extremely difficult conditions to continue reporting, the likes of which few veteran war reporters have experienced,” said Tania Kraemer, chair of the Foreign Press Association based in Jerusalem and a correspondent for German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle. “They face the constant threat of Israeli bombardment and have a hard time moving around. They also face the challenges faced by other Palestinians in Gaza: They are displaced, often living in tents without sufficient basic supplies in a situation of widespread chaos and lawlessness and are responsible for their families.” Reporters in Israel have also noted a marked increase in physical attacks, with the Union of Journalists in Israel noting at least 40 such attacks since October 7, from security forces as well as civilians. Four Israeli journalists were killed in the October 7 attacks, and others barely survived . Access and pressure One of the biggest challenges for international news organizations has been the complete blockade of the Gaza strip by Israel (and supported by Egypt) of foreign reporters entering the enclave. Although the Israeli military has taken international reporters on dozens of “embeds” with their troops, the reporters on these trips have no freedom of movement and are not allowed to speak to Palestinians. The raw footage is also subject to Israeli military censorship. CNN’s Clarissa Ward is one of the only foreign journalists to have entered the strip without the Israeli military, when she embedded with a United Arab Emirates field hospital crew . The FPA has petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to force the military to allow journalists to enter Gaza independently. So far, they’ve been unsuccessful. The Israeli government has also taken unprecedented steps that have pressured international press in Israel - most notably by shutting down Al Jazeera’s operations in Israel and the West Bank, alleging the network is “being used to incite terror, to support terrorist activities and that the channel’s broadcasts endanger … security and public order.” Al Jazeera, the Israeli Journalists Union, the FPA and many international organizations have slammed the move. CNN video Related video ‘I want her back alive, not in a bag’: A year of anguish for mothers in Israel and Gaza Israeli authorities have also become far more aggressive with the foreign press - at one point earlier this year Israeli authorities seized the video equipment of an Associated Press team that was airing live footage of the Gaza skyline as seen from southern Israel. Within a day, the equipment was hastily returned after swift backlash from the US and free press groups. Constant vitriol For the foreign journalists covering the conflict, the internal and external pressures over their reporting have been unlike anything they’ve ever experienced, several reporters who spoke with CNN said. All spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about sensitive subjects. An American journalist covering the conflict told CNN he’s taken on criticism, including from within his own newsroom, for interviewing figures that others found abhorrent whether they be an Israeli soldier, a Palestinian civilian, a rescued Israeli hostage or a member of Hamas. “Old school journalism is that you are curious about every player, and you want to understand what motivates them, and you want to understand their story, and you want to see things through their eyes, but I’ve experienced just really shocking pushback,” he said. On social media, the criticism has been more intense. “American journalists are talking to all the sides. That’s what we do. It’s the audiences that reject that very principle,” the reporter said. The reporter has come to see that Palestinians and Israelis, and those that support them, are experiencing the war with each other from “irreconcilable worlds” that are not able to understand “how their pain is wrapped up in the other people’s pain.” Nic Robertson reports from the site of the Nova Festival massacre in Israel, where pain and sorrow run deep in the families of those killed by Hamas last October 7. Clipped From Video video Related video Revisiting the site of the of Nova Music Festival massacre, one year on “You’re trying to do this superhuman task, which is be in everybody’s shoes and and try to convey and be true to the fullness of this war,” he said. But “this story really fundamentally makes you kind of question all the journalistic tenants that you were taught.” BBC News CEO Deborah Turness wrote in a memo ahead of the October 7 anniversary that “this is the most polarizing conflict that any of us have experienced in our careers as journalists.” “[I]f there is one thing we have learned more than any other in the past year, it’s that such is the depth of the polarization in this war, so many have come to see impartial reporting as being somehow against them, because it does not solely reflect their view of the conflict,” she wrote. A choice of words In the Middle East, a single word, or even the order in which certain phrases are uttered, can convey some sort of perceived bias. When should a person or a group be labeled a terrorist? What about a war crime? When should a military operation be called an invasion? Even laying out a timeline of when this latest conflict began is loaded with meaning. Some reporters noted that in recent years American and other foreign media have started shifting how they describe aspects of the conflict, such as calling the West Bank “occupied,” and noting Israeli villages in the West Bank as “illegal settlements under international law.” “People have woken up to things that maybe we didn’t pay attention to before,” a foreign reporter based in the region said. The war has made reporters and their audiences “a lot more vigilant and cynical,” with credibility issues from both Palestinian and Israeli sides. Janine Zacharia, a lecturer at Stanford University’s Department of Communications and former Jerusalem Bureau Chief for The Washington Post, said the news media can often get mired in a word choice debate when they shouldn’t. “People say, ‘You shouldn’t say militants. You should say terrorists on one side,’ and then the other side says, ‘You’ve got to call this a genocide. How can you not call this a genocide?’ So, I go back to what I learned at Reuters in the ‘90s, which is to say what it is, say what happened,” Zacharia said. “It’s better to say what’s happening more specifically on the ground and resist, when you can, labels that are disputed.” Professor William Lafi Youmans of George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs said he has found that there “has been an intensification of sedimented, institutionalized bias” toward Israeli framing over the past year, especially in television news. CNN video Related video IDF soldiers warned about attack before Oct. 7 Youmans said his research has shown “Palestinian frames” of the conflict using words like “occupation” and “apartheid,” are “rarely voiced on broadcast television” by reporters or anchors themselves, compared to “Israeli frames,”  such as describing Hamas members as “terrorists.” Youmans also noted that Israeli officials “are far more present” than Palestinian or Hamas officials. (The United States and European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Hamas is also the governing body of Gaza and administers all aspects of life there.) Others of course, argue the opposite. A former BBC governor, along with a former BBC director of television published a report claiming the broadcaster has routinely parroted anti-Israel views. The personal toll The pressures on the press in the region — Palestinian, Israeli and foreign — are of course, astronomical after a year of nonstop, difficult work. Beyond the physical threats, many have also faced mental health challenges from witnessing horrific violence both in person and from the vast documentation streaming into their newsrooms every hour. Then there’s relentless criticism of their work. One reporter told CNN he has had “physical reactions” to footage of the October 7 attacks, as well as the images and videos of victims in Gaza. Another said they can no longer eat red meat because of the images they’ve seen. Others have faced health problems from stress and have had personal relationships suffer due to their coverage. “Maybe I’m just numb,” one of the foreign reporters said with a cynical chuckle as he described what has become routine coverage of relentless airstrikes in Gaza. “You don’t want to be numb, but when you’ve done it 100 times already, that’s not a good thing.”"

Israel, its enemies and allies are all harbingers and painful witnesses to a remaking of the region’s diplomatic and political architecture on a scale that could rival the upheavals of the Arab-Israeli conflict a half-century ago. The post-October 7 changes are both inevitable and, in their current chaotic form at least, preventable. The civilian cost is mounting when diplomacy might have saved lives. A year ago it seemed the political architecture of the region was on the cusp of significant change. Propelled by US incentives, Saudi Arabia and Israel seemed closer than ever to a historic normalization of relations. Diplomacy and the deft skills needed to stitch such a complex deal together were in the ascendency. But the prospect of approaching peace and prosperity evaporated as Hamas surged through the Gaza border fences at sunrise that Saturday morning. Butchery was afoot.

Some survivors are determined to return Irrespective of whether Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was calculating he could torpedo normalization and push the Palestinian cause ahead of regional priorities for peace and economic integration, in the short term he succeeded. I can remember, with gut-churning clarity, the smell of rotting human flesh as we entered Kfar Aza, about 800 yards from the Gaza Strip. It was October 10, and Major General Itai Veruv of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was leading the first international press access to see the devastation of Hamas’ attacks. He stood at the gates, quoting General Eisenhower when he reached the Nazi death camps in World War Two: “The first thing he said was bring the press here to see.” Over the past year Israel has struggled to keep the world focused on those nation-changing events of that bloody weekend. For the first time, many Israelis realized their state was no longer the safe haven for Jews they had always believed it to be. The idea that whatever prejudice and persecution they may face around the world, in Israel they had sanctuary, was destroyed. What emerged that first week as a scramble to seal the Gaza border and chase down remaining Hamas cells inside Israel soon manifested as a red mist of revenge and retribution against the attackers, and anyone near them. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is unwilling to be a partner in a deal that would resow Middle East relations.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Israelis’ feelings of vulnerability haven’t gone, while national rage has been refined into a steely logic of regional deterrence, manifested by Israel’s right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He has interwoven his own political survival, in part to escape accusations he failed to stop Hamas’ attacks, with bombastic new tactics shredding the old rule book and its red lines that previously prevented regional escalation. It is being called “escalation for de-escalation,” but as October 7, 2024, arrives, de-escalation, and any form of day after plan from Netanyahu, are absent. The Jewish state’s relations with US President Joe Biden’s White House, its most important ally, are at their lowest ebb in a generation. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, many by US bombs and bullets in Israel’s hands, authorities in Gaza say. IDF killings and arrests of Palestinians, some of them US citizens, in the occupied West Bank are unsustainable for many of Israel’s European allies whom after a year of waiting are beginning to curb arms supplies. But the pressures on Israel to rein in its survival instincts at a time when it is riven with deep political, religious, and maybe existential divisions are having little obvious traction. CNN One Thing How October 7th Paved the Way for a Widening War In recent weeks, fears of a wider war between Israel and Iran have grown after Israel launched a series of attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran fired a barrage of missiles into Israel. The tense moment comes nearly one year after the brutal Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th and the devastation of Gaza that followed. In this episode, we examine how the last year has fundamentally reshaped the Middle East and whether any kind of peace is possible going forward.

Apple Podcasts Spotify TuneIn iHeart Radio Pandora Amazon RSS Israel’s wiliest nearby adversary and Iranian mega-proxy Hezbollah – a blight on Lebanese post-civil war democracy – which began escalating cross-border rocket attacks the day after October 7, has undergone a lightening defenestration over the past few weeks. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah and many of his top commanders have been assassinated in Israeli air strikes, its forces partially crippled, ahead of Israel’s launch of its third ground war in Lebanon in the past half-century. Hamas’ October 7 attacks, if not coordinated in detail with Iran , certainly had its blessing. The theocracy has been the Palestinian terror group’s biggest backer for decades, funneling money, military material and know-how. Iran vows to destroy Israel and chase its biggest ally the United States out of the region. It uses pro-Palestinian messaging to enflame passions on the ‘Arab street’ in the region, most of whom are Sunni like the Palestinians, and most of whose leaders consider Iran, a Shia theocracy, at best untrustworthy, at worst an adversary. In this way Iran holds off regional rivals. Children look up to the sky at the sound of airstrikes in Gaza City on Monday, Oct. 7, 2023.

(Samar Abu Elouf/The New York Times) Samar Abu Elouf/The New York Times/Redux gallery Related gallery The defining images of the Israel-Hamas war The past year has revealed the extent of its plans and co-opting of Shia communities to build up pro-Iranian militias. Yemen’s minority Houthis are no longer only anti-Saudi stooges for the Shia clerics in Tehran, but have turned their Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles and drones on Tel Aviv. Iran has also, aided and fronted by the Houthis, begun blocking Red Sea commercial shipping – more than a thousand miles from Israel – on the pretext of supporting the Gazans. Tehran’s Shia proxies in Iraq have also answered its calls and begun escalating drone attacks on Israel. It is a multi-fronted war, escalating faster than would have ever seemed possible a year ago. Back then rocket sirens in central Israel were not part of daily life. Today parents inside their home shelters in Tel Aviv scan cell phones for messages from their children, serving on the front lines as they too once did. Each generation here is trained to fight in the defense of the nation; where the country divide is over how long to keep that fight going before switching to diplomacy. The reality is, the longer the escalation goes on, the less control the country and its prime minister will have over the outcome. Potential regional partners like Saudi Arabia are now demanding a steeper and steeper diplomatic off-ramp for Netanyahu. The normalization between Israel and the most powerful Gulf state that seemed so close before October 7, is for now out of reach, Netanyahu unwilling and too toxic to be a partner in the deal. It was a deal that would have given Biden a legacy to be proud of; for Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, MBS, the legitimacy and security he craves; and Netanyahu, an inoculation against a millennia of animus. Saudi Arabia’s price now is an “irreversible path” to a Palestinian state, which is anathema to Netanyahu, his extreme nationalist right-wing cabinet, and in the wake of October 7, even further beyond the pale for much of the rest of the country too. Days before the anniversary, a veteran sage of UAE diplomacy, Anwar Gargash, foreshadowed the influential Gulf state’s direction of travel, saying “the era of militia with sectarian and regional dimensions has cost the Arabs dearly.” An end to Iran’s proxy powerplays and a path to a Palestinian state. The question is how to get there from here, particularly as the butcher’s cleaver is ascendant over the diplomat. For now, in the absence of successful peace talks, uncertainty is the new certainty."

In addition to ongoing bloodshed in Gaza, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified across swaths of Lebanon. Israel’s ambassador to the UN said 70,000 Israeli civilians have evacuated the northern part of their country after an onslaught of Hezbollah rockets and drones. The UN reported that 90,000 Lebanese civilians have fled their homes to avoid Israeli airstrikes. Meanwhile, hospitals in Gaza continue to struggle with overwhelming casualties and a lack of resources amid Israel’s ongoing operations there. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting began in the aftermath of the Hamas incursion into Israel one year ago.

As attention shifts to Lebanon after Israeli forces escalated their attacks on the Hezbollah militant group, Israel continues to operate across Gaza and is again focusing on an area it previously said was rid of Hamas. Elsewhere in Gaza, at least 25 people are confirmed dead after Israeli airstrikes hit a mosque and a school in the center of the territory, hospital officials say. Israel said Hamas was embedded in both buildings. Israel carried out airstrikes overnight Saturday into Sunday in northern Gaza including against what the military said were “weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure sites, terrorist cells, and additional military infrastructure sites.” In a statement, the military said it had detected the presence of Hamas members there, as well as efforts by them “to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area,” and was moving forward with the operation to “dismantle.” Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said it was engaged in “fierce fights” with Israeli forces in northern Gaza. Jabalya is a densely populated refugee camp that was among the first places targeted early on in Israel’s response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks one year ago. CNN Related article Israel’s kibbutz Be’eri became the symbol of Hamas’ brutality. Some survivors are determined to return Dozens of families in the area have packed up their belongings and fled once again after warnings from the Israeli military of the fresh ground operation in Jabalya, which is home to Gaza’s biggest refugee camp. The Israeli military issued a fresh evacuation order for residents in northern Gaza, adding it had expanded the scope of the “humanitarian area” in Al-Mawasi. “People left their homes this morning, and they don’t know where to go, carrying some simple belongings. There are no means of transportation,” Abu Alaa Asaf, a resident of Beit Lahiya, told CNN. “We heard the sounds of explosions all night long as if the war started today,” Asaf said Some residents of northern Gaza are refusing to move, saying there is no safe place left in the enclave. Mohammad Ibrahim, 36, from Jabalya, told CNN: “I, along with my two sons, have stayed in Jabalya and will not go anywhere. There is no safe place in Gaza, and death is the same here or there.” Jabalya is home to Palestinians who have been displaced multiple times during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The camp has already been targeted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) several times during the war. In May, CNN reported that the Israeli military had renewed its fighting in northern Gaza where it had claimed, in January, to have dismantled Hamas’ command structure. During that period, the Israeli military said Hamas was trying to “reassemble” in the area, raising doubts about whether Israel’s goal of eradicating the group in the enclave is realistic. In the separate incident in central Gaza, a mosque was targeted by Israeli forces early Sunday, killing at least 25 people, while another strike on a school killed four people, hospital officials said, CNN video showed chaotic scenes as bodies were pulled from rubble after the overnight attack on the religious site in Deir el Balah, where Palestinians were sheltering. “The mosque was a shelter for displaced people, there are no militants or anything inside,” said Nabil Nadda, who was nearby when the strike happened. “Just people who have no shelter, tents, or homes so they sheltered in the mosque.” The Israeli military confirmed it carrying out strikes on both sites, calling them “precise” and said were targeting Hamas “command and control” centers. The renewed fighting comes on the eve of the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, which saw Hamas kill around 1,200 people in Israel and seize more than 250 hostages. The Israeli offensive that followed in Gaza – which Israel says is aimed at destroying Hamas – has killed more than 41,000 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/us/anti-jewish-threats-us-adl/index.html,"‘Shocking,’ historic spike in anti-Jewish threats across the US, ADL says","Threats to Jews in the United States spiked over 200% in the one-year period since the deadly October 7th terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, according to new data obtained by CNN from the Anti-Defamation League.","Oct 7, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Josh Campbell,Middle East,"CNN — Threats to Jews in the United States tripled in the one-year period since the deadly October 7 terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, preliminary data provided to CNN by the Anti-Defamation League shows. More than 10,000 antisemitic incidents occurred between October 7, 2023, and September 2024 – up from 3,325 incidents the prior year. That marks the most incidents recorded in a 12-month period by the organization since it began tracking threats in 1979. Since last October’s terrorist attack, “Jewish Americans haven’t had a single moment of respite,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “Instead, we’ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.” The new preliminary figures released ahead of an upcoming full report by the organization come as police agencies across the country have ramped up patrols around Jewish and Muslim institutions as a precaution in response to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, Monday’s October 7 anniversary and the Jewish High Holidays. Since the war between Israel and Hamas began, reports of hate crimes and bias incidents targeting Jews, Muslims and Arabs have surged across the United States. In April, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it had received 8,061 reports of anti-Muslim bias in 2023, the highest number in the 28 years the group has tracked hate. “If you see something, say something,” Greenblatt said on Sunday in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. “We need people to report incidents. We need people to speak up. We should not be afraid in our own country.” On Friday, the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint public advisory indicating the anniversary of October 7 and continued Middle East turmoil could serve as motivators for acts of violence by extremists. ADL’s threat figures included more than 150 incidents of physical assault, more than 1,840 acts of vandalism and more than 8,000 antisemitic incidents involving verbal or written harassment. The organization noted at least 1,200 antisemitic incidents occurred on US college campuses over the past year, representing a 500% spike from the previous year’s data in the same category. US colleges and universities became a flash point earlier this year after thousands of protesters took to campuses from coast to coast to demonstrate in support of Palestinians facing bombardment from Israel’s military response to the October 7 terror attack. The Gaza health ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israeli launched its war against Hamas. Israel, meanwhile, says it has killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently confirm either set of figures, in part due to limited access afforded international journalists into the conflict zone. While US college protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, several were marked by violence, including clashes with law enforcement officials attempting to clear makeshift camps, numerous reports of antisemitic intimidation of Jewish students and faculty, and instances of assaults by counter-demonstrators. “ADL’s preliminary data also found that over 3,000 of all incidents took place during anti-Israel rallies, which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,” the organization said in a statement. According to the FBI, which enforces federal hate crime laws and collects statistics on acts of violence, threats to Jews in the U.S. far exceed any other category of crimes based on religion. “The Jewish community is uniquely – uniquely – targeted by pretty much every terrorist organization across the spectrum,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray in testimony before Congress shortly after the October 7 attack. “And when you look at a group that makes up 2.4%, roughly, of the American population,” Wray said, “it should be jarring to everyone that that same population accounts for something like 60% of all religious-based hate crimes.”"

Its tiled roof has caved in, windows smashed, littering the floors with sharp shards of terracotta and glass – the debris, still untouched, of a day of horror for Israel. “This house tells the story of Be’eri,” says Yarden Tzemach, a farmer and surviving resident of the kibbutz, one of the Israeli communities near Gaza that was overrun by Hamas militants last year. “In this house, people were murdered. A family , including three children, were kidnapped from here,” he says. Outside, beneath the fruit trees in the back yard, a toddler’s ride-on toy car, adorned with stickers of Winnie the Pooh, sits amid the rubble, a stark reminder of the lives shattered here. In some neighborhoods of Be’eri, barely a building was left intact. More than 100 of its 1,100 residents were killed and another 30 abducted to Gaza on October 7. Home after home was burned out or reduced to rubble and – a year on – many remain as poignant monuments to an ongoing trauma. At least 10 residents of the kibbutz, all friends and neighbors of each other, are among the more than 100 Israelis believed to still be held hostage.

Elsewhere in the administration building, two posters are taped in a window – one showing the names and faces of the kibbutz residents who were killed, and another listing those who are held hostage. Solvy, the Be’eri finance chairman, himself an Israeli veteran of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, is one of nearly 100 residents to have so far returned. Despite his personal loss, he came back to his house three months ago and is now helping lead efforts to bring kibbutz Be’eri, formerly a self-sustaining farming community, back to life. “I said to all the people that the best recovery is coming home.

And many of those who want to come back, he says, are unable to do so until the extensive damage has been repaired and homes rebuilt – a massive renovation project that means it will be at least 2 years, according to Solvy, before the majority of residents can return home. “There is no infrastructure for kids, there are no schools, so people with families cannot come back yet,” he explains.

The conversation, scheduled to last 10 minutes, ended up going 20, according to Wa’el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action , a group aimed at boosting the Muslim American vote. Harris did not make any promises, he said, but told them “that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.” “She pledged to work with our community, include our community, and (said) that she completely understands what we’re saying. She is hopeful that if she wins, she’ll be able to deliver on all of this once she’s president,” Alzayat told CNN. Alzayat said he and other Arab American leaders in the room had been contacted and invited within the previous 48 hours. Their message to Harris was simple, he said. She needed “to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don’t agree with.” The meeting came amid increasing frustration over Harris’ response to Israel’s recent escalations in Lebanon and concerns that her campaign was not willing to hear from critical voices. Harris is hamstrung, in part, because of her position: Vice presidents do not set US foreign policy. But as the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has expanded to a multifront conflict involving Iran, which launched missiles at Israel this week , and Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and Yemen, prominent Arab American groups have been pushing for more. Leaders at the meeting told Harris there is a critical need for both expanded evacuation efforts from Lebanon and immediate humanitarian aid for US citizens and the displaced families, one of the attendees told CNN. Assad Turfe, a Lebanese American and the deputy executive of Wayne County, said the recently announced $157 million in US humanitarian aid relief for Lebanon is not enough — but that it is better than nothing. “While this is still a drop in the bucket compared to what is truly needed, it’s a start, and this $157 million can make a difference if directed properly,” Turfe told CNN in a statement. Turfe also shared his deeply personal connection to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. “In 2006, I lost both of my grandmothers to Israeli bombs during the conflict in Lebanon. Today, as the violence rages on in Lebanon and Gaza, my family is once again facing the horrors of war, with my uncle, his wife, and their children fleeing for their lives,” Turfe said.

Emgage Action endorsed Harris last month while acknowledging “ strong disappointment ” with the Biden administration’s stance on Gaza. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez were among the prominent Democrats in the room for Friday’s meeting, according to Alzayat, along with local elected officials and Edward Gabriel, the former US ambassador to Morocco who now runs the nonprofit American Task Force on Lebanon. “We want her to push the president to end the war. We want her to commit to ending the war if she becomes president. We want her to speak directly to our communities about the pain and suffering,” Alzayat said he and other outside advocates told the vice president. “We want her and we want the administration to do a better job in providing assistance to American citizens who are trapped in Lebanon.” The Harris campaign has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. According to pool reports of the Friday gathering, a campaign official said that Harris “discussed her efforts to end the war in Gaza, such that: Israel is secure, hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, self-determination.” “On Lebanon, the vice president expressed concern about civilian casualties and displacement, and reiterated the administration’s position that, ultimately, a diplomatic solution is the best path to achieve stability and protect civilians. The vice president also discussed efforts to prevent regional war,” the official said. Absent from Friday’s guest list were leaders of the “Uncommitted” movement, which sprung up during the Democratic primaries this year in opposition to the Biden administration’s policy on the war in Gaza. Harris interacted with leaders of the group in early August during a photo line at the Detroit airport. The group has called on the vice president to hold meetings with families affected by the war after her campaign and national Democrats denied the group’s previous request for a Palestinian American to speak during the Democratic convention in Chicago this summer. Uncommitted leaders have since announced that their group will not endorse Harris , though they also warned against a vote for Donald Trump or, in states where they might appear on the ballot, third-party candidates. Uncommitted movement co-founder Abbas Alawieh, a former Capitol Hill staffer, confirmed Friday that his group was not invited to the meeting with Harris. In a social media post , Alawieh said he was “glad our pressure is helping yield more engagement. What we need right now is for the @VP to specifically say that as president she will respect international humanitarian and U.S. law and stop sending the Israeli military weapons for war crimes.” John King talks with Michigan voters Anushka Jalitsagi and Jade Grey in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

He cited growing frustration with what he described as a campaign more concerned with optics than addressing the anger and anxiety among Arab American voters. Zogby was part of a Wednesday call with Harris national security adviser Phil Gordon that the White House described as a virtual gathering with “Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American community leaders” to discuss the latest developments in the Middle East. “There was no ground broken. I wasn’t quite sure what the intent was other than to just say … that they met with leaders. There were no leaders,” Zogby said of the Wednesday conversation. That call and other communications with the Harris campaign, and Biden’s before that, have irked the longtime Democratic pollster. And Israel’s escalation in Lebanon has also turned up the heat in states like Michigan, where Lebanese Americans have made up a major part of the Democratic coalition. “With Lebanon in flames, they’ve got a bigger job. And I don’t think they’re ready to handle it,” Zogby said of the Harris campaign. “It’s sort of like trying to sell a car to somebody with terminal cancer. ‘What’re you talking for? I have bigger things on my mind right now.’” Abed Ayoub, the national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said there have been “many meetings with both the campaign and administration. They know our concerns and demands.” “Our position and work is focused on bringing an immediate ceasefire, and an end to the genocide in Palestine and the war on Lebanon,” said Ayoub, who noted that his group has nearly 130,000 active voters as members, including 7,500 in Michigan. This week, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, took the campaign’s pitch to Emgage Action’s “Million Muslim Votes: A Way Forward” summit. “I know the pain of this community is deep. Our hearts are broken. The concern of the vice president and Harris and I - it’s on our minds every day. The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families fleeing for safety, over and over again,” Walz said at the virtual event.

The official added that it is “really hard to tell” if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks to retaliate. “We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees,” the official said when asked by CNN if Israel has assured the US that Iran’s nuclear sites are off the table. US officials have voiced support for Israel responding to Iran’s missile attack earlier this week, with multiple officials publicly saying there must be consequences. At the same time, officials have also voiced concerns about a regional conflagration as they grapple with an increasingly volatile Middle East. President Joe Biden said earlier this week the US would not support Israel targeting Iran’s nuclear program. “If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields,” Biden said at a press briefing Friday.

The US has been working for almost a year to prevent the conflict from turning into a bigger war – and has so far done so, the official said. Right now, “this is on the edge,” the official added. Biden said Friday that US officials are in touch with their Israeli counterparts “12 hours a day.” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that there are “major efforts on both sides to keep lines of communication open and to make sure that perspectives are understood.” “There have been moments of surprise, I don’t think that’s a secret, over the course the last couple of months,” he acknowledged. “With respect to the Iranian attack on Israel, it is not just Israel that is thinking about its response options; it is also the United States,” Campbell said at an event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Our dominant message is, ‘let’s take great care in whatever we do with respect to Iran,’” Campbell said.

The bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, according to the conflict monitoring group Airwars. Israel’s strikes are occurring at “a level and intensity that Israel’s own allies just simply would not have carried out in the last 20 years,” Emily Tripp, director of the UK-based group, told CNN. She pointed to the United States-led military campaign against ISIS in 2017, where, at the height of the battle for Raqqa – the terror group’s de facto capital – 500 munitions were deployed in a single day. Over the course of two days, on September 24 and September 25, the Israel military said it used 2,000 munitions and carried out 3,000 strikes. In comparison, for most of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the US carried out less than 3,000 strikes a year, barring the first year of the invasion, where around 6,500 strikes were carried out – according to data from Airwars analyzed by CNN. “This isn’t normal,” Tripp said of both the scale and size of Israel’s strikes on Lebanon.  While Israel’s air campaign is extremely “unusual,” Tripp said its assault on Gaza over the last year – where nearly 60% of buildings are estimated to have been damaged from Israeli strikes – have normalized such mass assaults. Israel says it takes steps to minimize civilian harm, like making phone calls and sending text messages to residents in buildings designated for attack. Human rights groups like Amnesty International say such warnings do not absolve Israel of responsibilities under international humanitarian law to limit civilian harm. CNN has previously reported on Israel’s devastating use of 2,000-pound bombs , which experts blame for the high death toll in Gaza and appear to have been deployed in the airstrikes that killed Hezbollah’s leader , Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon. The massive munitions have impacted civilian infrastructure in Gaza and now Lebanon. CNN teams in Beirut this week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. As a result, the death toll in Lebanon continues to rise, with a fifth of its population now displaced. Umm Mohammed and her five-year-old son who escaped the Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon, are now sheltering under a tarpaulin on a seaside boardwalk in Beirut. Jomana Karadsheh/CNN Hezbollah and Israel have consistently been exchanging fire since October 8, the day after the Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group, has said that it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire in Gaza – where the Israeli bombardment has killed more than 41,000 people in the past year, according to the ministry of health in the territory – is reached. The majority of the fire exchanged between Israel and Hezbollah since the start of the war has come from Israeli strikes, drones, shelling and missiles on Lebanese territory, according to data from ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data), an organization that collects data on violent conflict. Israel has launched nearly 9,000 attacks into Lebanon since October 8; Hezbollah launched 1,500 attacks in that same time frame, according to the ACLED data. On September 25, Israel further escalated its air campaign with an intense barrage of strikes across swathes of Lebanon, marking the deadliest day for Lebanon since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war – and a turning point in the current conflict. While most of Israel’s airstrikes over the past year have targeted southern Lebanon, Israel has also ramped up its attacks on Lebanon’s capital in recent weeks, with multiple airstrikes in southern Beirut flattening residential buildings and heavily populated civilian areas. A rapid succession of strikes has killed at least seven high-ranking Hezbollah commanders and officials in recent weeks, dealing the most significant blow to the group since its formation in the early 1980s. Those strikes have mostly been concentrated in the city’s southern Dahiyeh neighborhood, a densely packed residential area and Hezbollah stronghold. It was there that Israel assassinated the militant group’s leader in an air raid on his underground bunker on September 27. But as Israel’s campaign to disarm Hezbollah continues, civilians are paying the highest price, including 127 children who have been killed in less than three weeks, according to the health ministry. On September 23 alone, at least 558 people – including 50 children and 94 women – were killed. Women and girls are also particularly affected by the displacement caused by the airstrikes, according to Lebanon’s country director at the humanitarian agency CARE International. Nearly half of the people in Lebanon’s emergency shelters for displaced people are children, and the facilities are operating beyond capacity, Michael Adams said. Now, Israel is targeting central Beirut  – not its suburbs – with airstrikes for the first time in nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, a quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military evacuation orders​ as Israel intensifies its ground operation in the south, with its inhabitants pushed more than 30 miles north of their homes. More than 100 villages in southern Lebanon have now been issued the evacuation notices, stoking fears of an expanded ground invasion. Residents have no idea when they might be able to return - or what they might find remaining. CNN’s Allegra Goodwin, Eyad Kourdi and Soph Warnes contributed to this report."

But we’d always admire the view and say: ‘When? When is it going to come?’” the 32-year-old software engineer told CNN. “We always thought that the October 7 (attack) would happen here, we always talked about it,” he said, rolling a cigarette outside a hotel on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, about 40 miles from Kiryat Shmona. Pinhas’ parents and his elderly grandmother have been living in this hotel for almost a year, ever since they were evacuated from Kiryat Shmona following the October 7 terror attacks.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN Kiryat Shmona, which sits in a pocket of Israeli land surrounded by Lebanon, just a couple of miles to the south and east from the border, sits on the opposite side of Israel to where the Hamas-led attacks took place last year. But its proximity to Lebanon makes it vulnerable to Hezbollah , the Iran-backed militant group that has been attacking Israel on a regular basis over the past year, in support of Hamas. Israel has responded with cross-border attacks and the two sides have been engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation since October 8. Hezbollah has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. The city was hit multiple times in recent months, most recently by a barrage of rockets that caused heavy damage and several fires on Friday morning, according to Israeli police.

What Israel does next will be pivotal But Pinhas told CNN it wasn’t the rockets that forced him and his family to evacuate their homes. There have always been rocket attacks in Kiryat Shmona. “When I was growing up, it wasn’t just sirens like now… it was someone blaring from a car, ‘everybody get to shelters! Everybody get to shelters!’ And in school, when the alarm went off, nobody was freaking out because we were used to it,” he said. “Everybody goes into the shelter, you hear the bombs and then wait for somebody to tell you it’s safe to leave,” he explained, adding that while the locals have gotten used to attacks from the skies, there has always been the worry that Hezbollah could try to storm them from the ground. “There was a warning some months before October 7, saying you need to know that the next war won’t be just rockets. They will come here. There are a lot of tunnels, and we need to prepare ourselves… and we didn’t. People are stupid. Until something happens, you don’t really act,” he said. But then came the shock of the terror attacks, when Hamas and other militant groups killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped some 250 more into Gaza . “Everything has changed then,” Pinhas said. “We thought our army was strong and prepared and suddenly you see this, shooting everywhere. I had three friends who were at the Nova festival , one of them died, two were saved,” he said. Yair Pinhas visits his family at the hotel where they have been living for almost a year after being evacuated from Kiryat Shmona. Ivana Kottasova/CNN ‘There will be a lot of deaths’ The Israeli government said the fate of people like Pinhas is among the reasons why it needs to act forcefully against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly meeting last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah had fired more than 8,000 rockets at Israel since October 8, forcing some 60,000 people to flee their homes along the border. “Israel has been tolerating this intolerable situation for nearly a year. Well, I’ve come here today to say enough is enough. We won’t rest until our citizens can return safely to their homes,” he said. Shortly after Netanyahu spoke at the UN, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a deadly strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut, targeting and killing Hezbollah’s long term leader Hassan Nasrallah .

(AP Photo/Baz Ratner) Baz Ratner/AP Related article With Hezbollah weakened, Israel’s challenge becomes knowing when to pull back Three days later, the IDF said it was launching a “limited and localized” ground operation in Lebanon. The IDF’s top spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the move was designed to prevent an October-7 style attack by Hezbollah and “to enable all 60,000 Israelis to safely return back to their homes in northern Israel.” But at least some of the people whose fates Netanyahu invoked during his speech are questioning the decision. Speaking to CNN on her terrace in the village of Shtula, Ora Hatan said she was worried the fight in the hills around the border might prove too costly for Israel. “I think that it’s very dangerous for the army to go to Lebanon, because there are many, many traps… I think that we can protect the border by plane. Or go (in) and come back… But not stay (in Lebanon), it’s too dangerous,” she said. Hatan, whose house overlooks the Lebanese border, has lived in Shtula her whole life. She said that she’s worried current warfare is much more deadly than it was in 2006,  the last time Israel invaded Lebanon. Pinhas, too, is conflicted about Israel’s decision to cross the border. “It’s very hard. On (the) one hand, I can say, yes, you’re right, because we need to go back home and we need to bring peace to our town. So my first thought is we need to do something about it, because their (Hezbollah’s) main purpose is to kill us,” he said. Ora Hatan speaks on the phone at her house near the Israeli border with Lebanon. Ivana Kottasová/CNN “But the other thing that I’m feeling, and everybody’s feeling that, is that this is very dangerous, and there will be a lot of deaths. Hezbollah, they know very well their territory there, this is their playground. This is not like in 2006, this is not a small group, we gave them a lot of time to prepare themselves and get a lot of ammunition,” he added, referencing the 2006 Israeli invasion into Lebanon which lasted 34 days and ended in a stalemate after killing some 1,100 people on the Lebanese side and about 170 Israelis. For Lebanon, this war is already deadlier. At least 1,401 people have been killed in the country since September 17 when Israel began its current bombardment, according to a CNN count based on information from the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Around 1 million people have been displaced, according to the minister in charge of Lebanon’s crisis management center. The Israeli offensive is among the most intense in decades, surpassed only by its bombing of Gaza.

A city of some 22,000, Kiryat Shmona has turned into a ghost town over the past year. Signs of destruction are clearly visible throughout its streets – shrapnel holes in facades, damage caused by falling debris, destruction caused by direct hits by rockets. On Thursday, marking the Jewish new year, the Pinhas family snuck back into Kiryat Shmona for a brief visit. “To water the plants and feed the cats. There are many street cats in Kiryat Shmona and they need feeding,” Pinhas said. Several rockets were fired at the city from Lebanon on Thursday but were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defense systems, the bright light of interceptor missiles popping up in the skies and chasing away the threat. A black and white cat, meanwhile, continued to rummage through the pile of debris lying in front of a family home destroyed in an earlier rocket attack."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/economy/israel-economy-war-impact/index.html,Israel’s economy is paying a high price for its widening war,The damage to Israel’s economy from its prolonged war against Hamas is worsening as the conflict nears the one-year mark and spills over into the wider region.,"Oct 4, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Hanna Ziady,Middle East,"London CNN — In late September, as Israel’s nearly year-long war widened and its credit rating was downgraded yet again, the country’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that, while Israel’s economy was under strain, it was resilient. “Israel’s economy bears the burden of the longest and most expensive war in the country’s history,” Smotrich said on September 28, a day after Israeli airstrikes killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon’s capital Beirut, ratcheting fears that tensions with the militant group would turn into a full-blown conflict. “The Israeli economy is a strong economy that even today attracts investments.” Almost a year after Hamas’ deadly attack on October 7, Israel is pushing forward on multiple fronts: launching a ground incursion against Hezbollah in Lebanon, carrying out airstrikes in Gaza and Beirut , and threatening retaliation for Iran’s ballistic missile attack earlier this week. As the conflict spills over into the wider region , the economic costs will spiral too, both for Israel and other countries in the Middle East. “If recent escalations turn into a longer and more intense war, this will take a heavier toll on economic activity and growth (in Israel),” Karnit Flug, a former governor of Israel’s central bank, told CNN on October 1. The war has significantly worsened the situation in Gaza, pushing it into an economic and humanitarian crisis long ago, and the West Bank is “undergoing a rapid and alarming economic decline,” the United Nations said in a report last month. The Lebanese economy, meanwhile, could contract by up to 5% this year due to cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, according to BMI, a market research firm owned by Fitch Solutions. Israel’s economy could shrink even more than that, based on a worst-case estimate by the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. Even in a more benign scenario, its researchers also see Israel’s gross domestic product per head — which in recent years overtook the United Kingdom’s — falling this year, as Israel’s population grows faster than the economy and living standards decline. Before the October 7 attack and ensuing Israel-Hamas war, the International Monetary Fund forecast that Israel’s economy would grow by an enviable 3.4% this year. Now, economists’ projections range from 1% to 1.9%. Growth next year is also expected to be weaker than earlier forecasts. Yet Israel’s central bank is not in a position to cut interest rates to breathe life into the economy because inflation is accelerating, propelled by rising wages and soaring government spending to fund the war. ‘Long-term’ economic damage The Bank of Israel estimated in May that costs arising from the war would total 250 billion shekels ($66 billion) through the end of next year, including military outlays and civilian expenses, such as on housing for thousands of Israelis forced to flee their homes in the north and south. That is equivalent to roughly 12% of Israel’s GDP. Those costs look set to rise further as fiercer fighting with Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, adds to the government’s defense bill and delays the return of Israelis to their homes in the country’s north. Israel launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah on September 30. Smotrich, the finance minister, is confident that Israel’s economy will bounce back once the war ends, but economists are concerned the damage will far outlast the conflict. Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, pictured in June 2024. Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images Flug, the former Bank of Israel governor and now vice-president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute, says there is a risk the Israeli government cuts investment to free up resources for defense. “That will reduce the potential growth (of the economy) going forward,” she said. Researchers at the Institute for National Security Studies are similarly downbeat. Even a withdrawal from Gaza and calm on the border with Lebanon ﻿would leave Israel’s economy in a weaker position than before the war, they said in a report in August. “Israel is expected to suffer long-term economic damage regardless of the outcome,” they wrote. “The anticipated decline in growth rates in all scenarios compared to pre-war economic forecasts and the increase in defense expenditures could exacerbate the risk of a recession reminiscent of the lost decade following the Yom Kippur War.” The 1973 war, also known as the Arab-Israeli war, launched by Egypt and Syria against Israel’s forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, ushered in a long period of economic stagnation in Israel, partly as the country massively ramped up defense spending. Likewise, potential tax hikes and cuts to non-defense spending — some already mooted by Smotrich — to fund what many expect to become a permanently enlarged military, could hurt economic growth. Such measures, coupled with a weakened sense of security, could also spur an exodus of highly educated Israelis, notably tech entrepreneurs, Flug warned. “It doesn’t have to be in very large numbers, because the tech sector is very dependent on a few thousand of the most innovative, creative and entrepreneurial individuals,” she said of a sector that accounts for a hefty 20% of Israel’s economic output. A Jewish man walks past closed shops in Jerusalem's Old City on September 11, 2024. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images A large-scale departure of high-earning taxpayers would further dent Israel’s finances, which have taken a knock from the war. The government has delayed publishing a budget for next year as it grapples with competing demands that make it hard to balance its books. The conflict has caused Israel’s budget deficit — the difference between government spending and revenue, mostly from taxes — to double to 8% of GDP, from 4% before the war. Government borrowing has soared and become more expensive, as investors demand higher returns to buy Israeli bonds and other assets. Multiple downgrades to Israel’s credit ratings made by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are likely to raise the country’s cost of borrowing even further. In late August — a month before Israel carried out strikes on Lebanon’s capital and the ground incursion against Hezbollah in the country’s south — the Institute for National Security Studies estimated that just one month of “high-intensity warfare” in Lebanon against the militant group, with “intensive attacks” in the opposite direction that damage Israeli infrastructure, could cause Israel’s budget deficit to soar to 15% and its GDP to contract by up to 10% this year. Uncertainty ‘the biggest factor’ To shrink the fiscal hole, the government can’t rely on a healthy flow of tax revenue from businesses, many of which are collapsing, while others are reluctant to invest while it’s unclear how long the war will last. Coface BDi, a major business analytics company in Israel, estimates that 60,000 Israeli firms will shut this year, up from an annual average of around 40,000. Most of these are small, with up to five employees. “Uncertainty is just bad for the economy, bad for investment,” said Avi Hasson, the CEO of Startup Nation Central, a non-profit that promotes Israel’s tech industry globally. In a recent report, Hasson warned that the remarkable resilience of Israel’s tech sector so far “will not be sustainable” in the face of the uncertainty created by the prolonged conflict and the government’s “destructive” economic policy. Even before the October 7 attack, government plans to weaken the judiciary were prompting some Israeli tech companies to incorporate in the United States . The insecurity created by the war has exacerbated that trend, with most new tech companies formally registered overseas, despite tax incentives to incorporate locally, and a large number considering moving some of their operations outside Israel, Hasson told CNN last month. He remains bullish on Israeli tech, pointing to robust fundraising, but cautions that the industry’s future growth “depends on regional stability and responsible government policies.” Apartment blocks and office buildings under construction in Tel Aviv in August 2024. Florion Goga/Reuters Other sectors of Israel’s economy, while less important than tech, have been hit much harder. The agriculture and construction sectors have struggled to fill gaps left by Palestinians whose work permits have been suspended since October last year, pushing up prices for fresh vegetables and leading to a steep decline in housebuilding. Tourism has also taken a knock, with arrivals down sharply this year. Israel’s tourism ministry has estimated that the drop in foreign tourists has translated into 18.7 billion shekels ($4.9 billion) in lost revenue since the start of the war. The Norman, a boutique hotel in Tel Aviv, has had to lay off some staff and cut its prices by up to 25%, partly because some of its facilities — including its Japanese rooftop restaurant — remain closed to save on costs. Occupancy levels have fallen from above 80% before war to below 50% currently, according to the hotel’s general manager Yaron Liberman. “We know the day when the war will finish it’s going to be crazy here as far as business coming back,” he told CNN in mid-September, citing correspondence from would-be guests keen to visit Israel but unable to book flights or secure travel insurance. But for now, “the biggest factor is the uncertainty,” Liberman said. “When is the war going to end?”"

For nearly a week, Israel has been bombarding Hezbollah-dominated residential neighborhoods in the southern suburbs of Beirut. But this strike in a Shia quarter near the parliament building – a part of the city that has been spared since the 2006 war with Israel – signaled that the scope of Israel’s campaign may be quickly expanding. Windows across the skyline lit up just as the crash and boom of the missile roused people from sleep. A dark plume of smoke rose from the heart of the capital — people frantically called their loved ones as they tried to work out where Israel’s bombs had hit this time. The strike had bombed an office belonging to the Islamic Health Authority, affiliated with Hezbollah, in the central Bashura neighborhood, killing nine people including seven medics, according to the health ministry and the Islamic Health Authority itself. On the street impacted by the strike, people wandered in a daze. Women cradled babies in their arms, as they weaved through the carnage. Unlike the southern suburbs and other parts of the country, there was no warning to evacuate this Shia-majority neighborhood. Down the road is the Mohammad al-Amin mosque, a colossal landmark in the city, now an emblem for the constant state of movement of the roughly 1 million people displaced by Israel’s air offensive in Lebanon which began last Monday. Families fleeing the central Beirut strike on Thursday streamed into the mosque’s grounds. Just as they arrived, many of those who had already been camped out there were packing up their belongings to flee again. The newly displaced were replacing those already made homeless, who were now seeking safer grounds north of the city. Smoke billows over Beirut after overnight Israeli air strikes on October 3, 2024. Joseph Campbell/Reuters “The whole mosque shook. People ran away thinking they were going to be bombed,” said a middle-aged women named Fatima. She sat on a folded up cardboard box, leaning against a column. “And just as they fled, others came.” “If I weren’t so sick, I would have left too. But I don’t have the energy to be displaced again.” The Mostafa family from the southern Beirut suburbs share three mattresses amongst themselves amid the mosque’s looming colonnades. “I can’t afford to leave this place,” said Mostafa Mostafa. “Isn’t it such a shame, what’s happened? We were a proud Lebanese family with a roof over our heads. Our home gave us dignity. Now look at the state of us.” Fears of mission creep Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has killed over 1,300 people since it began on September 17, according to a CNN tally of Lebanon’s health ministry statements. Israel’s war cabinet said it aimed to repatriate 60,000 people displaced by Hezbollah’s rocket fire in the country’s northern-most territory. Hezbollah for its part said it would only agree to a ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border when the Israeli offensive in Gaza ends. Israel says that its strikes have targeted Hezbollah’s weapons depots, command and control structures and its general infrastructure. But many of those killed are believed to be civilians, according to the health ministry which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. An air warfare expert told CNN that the ferocity of the campaign in Lebanon already matches that of Gaza, where a ground, air and naval offensive levelled large parts of the besieged strip. The war here may have just arrived at yet another dangerous juncture. Israel has amassed its troops on the border and begun its ground war. It has rained down artillery and drone strikes on the area, forcing people to flee as the Israeli military seek to pave the way for an invasion of the south of the country and establish a establish a buffer zone.

According to multiple reports, Israeli forces have breached the armistice line between Lebanon and Israel several times in the last two days, conducting raids and enduring fatalities, and then withdrawing Meanwhile Israel’s targeting of Hezbollah’s civilian arms, such as the health authority on Thursday morning and its media center later in the afternoon, widened the scope of its stated goals to destroy the Iran-backed group’s command and control as well as its arsenal. It has raised the specter of mission creep, thrusting the country, no stranger to conflict and crises, into uncharted waters. “We are now literally paralyzed. We cannot do anything,” said Mahdi, an alumnus of the American University of Beirut, a five minute drive from the site of the attack on the Islamic Health Authority.

As we remain extremely shocked by what is happening, and our thoughts are with those who are suffering, we urge all parties to restore peace to the region with immediate effect.” CNN has reached out to both the Palestine Football Association (PFA) and the Israel Football Association (IFA) for comment on the decision. The PFA called for FIFA to ban the IFA, its national teams and club teams earlier this year. The original PFA motion was tabled in April before being raised at FIFA’s Congress in May with a decision expected in July. The timeframe for a decision was then delayed multiple times before Thursday’s announcement. FIFA did not disclose when it would announce results of the investigation. The PFA argued that the IFA should be banned from world football because of the “violation of international law through the occupation of the Gaza Strip; Racism and discrimination against Palestinian athletes in two Israeli clubs and violation of FIFA statutes through the league participation of five Israeli clubs from illegal settlements on Palestinian territory.” These claims have been rejected by the IFA. FIFA charged an independent panel to pull together evidence which was presented on Thursday to the 37 members of the FIFA council. The FIFA council said it adopted two conclusions and recommendations following today’s hearing. “The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offence of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,” the outcome read. “The FIFA Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate – and subsequently advise the FIFA Council on – the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.” Both men’s national teams are in action next week. Palestine plays Iraq in World Cup qualifying on October 10 and Israel plays France in the Nations League on the same day."

Seven people were killed and 16 wounded in the attack on Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, a port neighborhood in southern Tel Aviv, according to Israeli Police. The incident happened just minutes before Iran launched a barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, its largest-ever such attack , sending sirens blaring across the country and residents running to bomb shelters. Video posted online showed Lev Kreitman, who served six months as a reservist with the Israeli military in Gaza, firing a gun at an unknown target before running away. The footage was filmed from a nearby building in Jaffa and appears to show Kreitman wearing a pink shirt, white shorts and flip flops. In another video, Kreitman was seen walking in the background among Israeli soldiers who were at the scene of the attack. Speaking to CNN affiliate Channel 11, Kreitman said he had been carrying his personal handgun after his time with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Recalling Tuesday’s incident, he said how he spotted what he described as “two terrorists,” one moving toward him. “The other goes somewhere else, runs somewhere else, and I’m here, right where we’re standing, I surprised him from the side, shoot,” Kreitman said, adding he understood straight away it was an attack. “I tried to do my best in the very crazy situation, amid alarms, missiles, and interceptions in the sky,” he said.

The trance festival in southern Israel’s Negev Desert was one target of the militant group’s rampage in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others kidnapped and taken to Gaza. Israel’s ensuing war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 people, created a humanitarian catastrophe and left much of the Palestinian enclave in ruins. Police said Wednesday that two gunmen had begun their “killing spree” by opening fire on passengers aboard a light rail car that had stopped at a station in Jaffa. They had then continued their attack on foot on Jerusalem Boulevard, according to police. The attackers were stopped by security forces and civilians who used personal guns, police added. “They had an M-16 type weapon, cartridges and a knife in their possession,” police said in a statement. Medics said they treated victims at several sites on Jerusalem Boulevard, including near train tracks, in the street, at a synagogue and in a butcher’s shop. The injured were taken to hospitals while air-raid alarms sounded in the region and throughout Israel.

American officials are not privately trying to persuade Israel to hold back on retaliating against Iran, two senior administration officials told CNN, a notable difference from April when Biden encouraged Israel to “take the win” following the successful interception of a barrage of Iranian drones and missiles. Instead, Biden hopes Israel will adopt a measured approach that can both uphold its right to strike back while avoiding action that could prompt further retaliation and tip the region into full-scale war. “No one’s saying don’t respond,” one senior administration official said. “No one’s saying, ‘Take the win.’” How that message will be received by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains to be seen, particularly as his political standing appears more assured following successful efforts to degrade Hezbollah in Lebanon. “Iran made a big mistake, and it will pay for it,” he said at the start of a security cabinet meeting Tuesday. Biden’s efforts at influencing his Israeli counterpart over the past year have been largely ineffective, and the two men have not spoken since August. Biden told reporters Wednesday he plans to speak to Netanyahu “relatively soon,” but didn’t appear to have a conversation on the books. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said discussions with Israel are ongoing and highlighted the risks of the situation. “The region is really balancing on a knife’s edge and real concerns about an even broader escalation … which could imperil not just Israel, but our strategic interests as well,” Campbell said Wednesday. The stakes of the moment could not be higher. Biden has watched with mounting concern as tensions in the region have spiraled. Attempts at brokering ceasefire agreements both in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border have been largely fruitless. And the pending American presidential election has elevated the stakes of trying to manage the crisis. The scale of Tuesday’s attack far outstripped the shower of projectiles Iran fired toward Israel in April. Israel and the United States were again successful in thwarting the missiles, in part due to a monthslong effort at coordinating a response. But the scale of the attack, which Biden called “brazen” in the hours after it happened, led American officials to conclude that a response from Israel was warranted. “Israel has a right to respond. It should be a proportional response,” Biden told reporters Wednesday following a virtual call with leaders from the Group of 7 industrialized nations. He said the leaders were in agreement on that point and were preparing to slap new sanctions on Iran. That is a different tone than mid-April, when US officials encouraged Israel to recognize that Iran had inflicted limited damage and urged them move on. Israel did respond against Iran, but in a limited way, striking an air defense system in Isfahan. Now, a bigger Israeli counterattack is expected that could include a range of targets. The administration currently assesses it’s unlikely Israel would target Iran’s nuclear sites, though one senior official said Israel still hasn’t decided on where it might strike. ‘Taking a beat and thinking about it’ “They are doing the smart thing and taking a beat and thinking about it,” the official said. Biden said Wednesday he does not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. “The answer is no,” he responded when questioned about the prospect of Israel launching a retaliatory strike on sites related to Iran’s nuclear program. Such a decision by Israel would almost certainly trigger the out-of-control conflict Biden has been working to prevent in the year since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7. For Netanyahu and some his most hawkish advisers, however, it could eliminate what is viewed as an existential threat to Israel once and for all. In the aftermath of this week’s attacks, the US is closely monitoring any activity surrounding Iran’s nuclear program, but they have not seen any recent changes, two US officials said. A central US concern is the possibility of Iran turning to bolster its nuclear program after Israel successfully degraded its proxies in Lebanon and Gaza and foiled its ballistic missile attack. While there are no signals currently that Iran will do that, or is planning to, US officials are still monitoring for the possibility of such a move. There has not been a dramatic shift in Iran’s nuclear posture recently, though over the last year Iran has further produced fissile material for its nuclear program. Earlier this year Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Iran’s breakout time – the amount of time needed to produce enough nuclear material for a nuclear weapon – “is now probably one or two weeks.” No Israelis were hurt or killed in Tuesday’s Iranian attack, which appeared to target military and intelligence facilities. One Palestinian man was killed in the West Bank by falling shrapnel from an interceptor missile launched by Israel, according to the hospital where he was treated. With the two-day Jewish new year holiday Rosh Hashanah starting on Wednesday, there is some expectation an Israeli reprisal could still be days away. “They have the holiday so that buys time and space,” one of the senior US officials said. Yet waiting days for a response also has the effect of prolonging anticipation in a region already on a razor’s edge, especially as Israel’s operation against Hezbollah continues. CNN reported Wednesday that US officials and Israeli believe about 50% of the Iranian proxy group’s arsenal has been destroyed. Inside the White House, there is acute recognition that how the next weeks play out will have some effect on the presidential election. There is little Vice President Kamala Harris — the Democratic nominee — wants less than a full-scale regional war that her opponent can use to accuse the Biden administration of incompetence. A close observer of American politics, Netanyahu is similarly aware of how Israel’s actions in the coming weeks could impact the race. Some Western officials believe he sees an opening in the high-stakes political moment to take decisive action against Iran, aware that Biden and Harris have faced criticism from all sides on their handling of the war. For her part, Harris emerged Tuesday afternoon to read a carefully worded statement about the Iranian strikes in Israel. “I’m clear eyed,” she said, not diverting from prepared remarks. “Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East, and today’s attack on Israel only further demonstrates that fact.”"

The conflict would not be contained in Gaza, the thinking went – Hezbollah would attack Israel from the north, the Houthis from Yemen, and Iranian proxies from Iraq. Israel would be forced to respond, it would come into direct conflict with Iran, and the wider war would be upon us. Nearly one year later, all those things have come to pass. A day after Iran launched its largest ever ballistic missile attack on Israel – and as Israeli troops battle Hezbollah fighters on the ground in Lebanon – regional war is effectively here. The big question now is: Will it escalate, or cool? Israel’s leaders stand at a juncture. When Iran first staged a missile attack in April, in retaliation for an Israeli strike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Israel was restrained, striking only an Iranian air defense installation in response. But Iran’s attack on Tuesday night was unprecedented in its ferocity. Despite some strikes on Israeli bases, damage was minimal, nearly all missiles were intercepted, and one person – a Palestinian man struck by shrapnel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank – was killed. Israel now faces a choice, a former senior Israeli military official told CNN: “Are you responding to the intention or to the results?” Iran’s government has “absolutely no interest in a broader war,” government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Wednesday, adding that the country restrained itself after the assassination in July of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran “despite demands” from its people to respond. Israelis take cover as projectiles launched from Iran are intercepted in the skies over Rosh Haayin. Maya Alleruzzo/AP Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ridden a string of assassinations around the Middle East to a remarkable political rehabilitation. Israel’s bombing campaign in Lebanon has devastated the civilian population – displacing more than 1 million people – but has achieved a long-coveted goal of at least temporarily neutering a persistent threat to the north. Why not seize the moment to weaken the patron state itself, Iran? “The elimination of Nasrallah is a necessary condition in achieving the objectives we have set: Returning the residents of the north safely to their homes and changing the balance of power in the region for years,” Netanyahu said in the wake of a massive strike in Beirut last month that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Two days later, he addressed Iranians themselves, saying, “when Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, everything will be different.” His stance is in tune with Israeli public opinion too. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is leading the charge pushing for a maximalist response to Tehran’s attack, proposing that Israel bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, which the US and others say are responsible for a weapons program, a charge Iran has long denied. “Sometimes history knocks on your door and you’ve got to seize the moment,” he told CNN on Tuesday . “If we don’t do it now, I don’t see it ever happening.” Iran’s two arms to fight Israel – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – “are temporarily paralyzed,” Bennett said. “So it’s like a boxer out in the ring without arms for the next few minutes. Now is the time that we can attack, because Iran is fully vulnerable.” Smoke rises following Israel's bombardment in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. Baz Ratner/AP That response, of course, carries with it the danger of the unknown. Hezbollah is certainly weakened, but no one knows for certain how much capacity it still has. The US government believes that Iran could build a bomb in just weeks once it decides to do so. Short of the nuclear option, Tehran has other ways of applying further pressure on Israel and its allies. Escalating responses could spiral completely out of anyone’s control and drag allies into the fight. The former senior Israeli military official explained that “there are always schools of thought.” Bennett’s, according to the official, is that “it’s time to neutralize the whole axis of evil. We started with Hamas, then Hezbollah. It is now the time for Iran, maybe Syria.” The former official said they had no direct knowledge of Israel’s plans but requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “Last night it seemed to me like it was going to be an overwhelming response,” they said. “This morning, I am getting messages that they are taking the time to think.” A more restrained response would see Israel target a military facility, as Iran did on Tuesday in Israel. “You could hit infrastructure, very similar to what happened in Yemen,” the former official, referring to an Israeli bombing campaign on the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah on Sunday. “National export of oil, or anything else.” The unknown factor is how far Israel’s most important ally – the United States – will go in supporting its response. “We have made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday. “It is too early for me to tell you anything publicly in terms of our assessment or in terms of what our expectations are of the Israelis or the advice that we would give them.”"

Officials told CNN the increased police presence at key locations is out of an abundance of caution as a deterrent and was not based on any specific threats. Despite the lack of any known credible threats, law enforcement officials have described the potential for violence from so-called “lone wolf” attackers as among their most serious concerns during what they have described as a heightened threat environment . The increased patrols come as Rosh Hashanah – which is the first of the high holidays and considered the Jewish New Year – is set to begin at sunset Wednesday and end at nightfall Friday. Next week, Yom Kippur , the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, will be celebrated beginning Friday at sunset through nightfall on Saturday. The NYPD assumed an increased patrol posture on Monday, a law enforcement source told CNN, which is expected to be maintained throughout the next two weeks. NYPD will also partner with state police for explosive detection missions at bridges and tunnels, and helicopter units will be used for radiation detection, the source said. Los Angeles police department leaders recently participated in a security town hall with Jewish community leaders in Southern California to discuss the ramping up of patrols during the religious holidays. The LAPD has routinely increased its presence at both Jewish and Muslim houses of worship based on turmoil in the Middle East. At the town hall last week, the LAPD said its patrols would include an increased number of officers on the beat, command post vehicles, and horse mounted units. The meeting was intended to reassure members of the Jewish community, many of whom have expressed concerns about security after an anti-Semitic attack in the city last year where two men were shot leaving a Jewish synagogue by a man who was sentenced Monday to 35 years in federal prison. Chicago police said the department plans to give “special attention to houses of worship” and will be monitoring all activity. “While there is no actionable intelligence at this time, we will have an increased police presence to ensure the city’s faith communities are not only safe, but feel safe,” said the department in a statement. Asked about Tuesday’s attack on Israel, a spokesperson for the Miami Beach Police Department said it had “heightened our uniformed presence across the city to ensure public safety.” The Philadelphia Police Department told CNN it was closely monitoring the situation in Israel “and assessing any potential impacts on our local community. Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken proactive measures, including increased patrols around local Jewish and Islamic places of worship and community centers, to ensure the safety of all community members.” In addition to law enforcement agencies, national Jewish security organizations have been working to identify any potential threats to houses of worship in the US. “What we have previously told Jewish institutions is that at this time, there is no known credible threat to the Jewish Community in the U.S.,” said Oren Segal, Vice President of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, adding the organization recommends places of worship remain open during the high holidays. “However, given the heightened tensions and increased risk to the community at this time, we recommend institutions review and implement a series of security precautions and procedures,” Segal said.

Here’s what we know,"The Middle East is edging ever closer toward a full-blown regional war as Israel vowed to respond to Iran’s huge barrage of ballistic missiles fired at the country on Tuesday night, capping a day of dramatic military escalation in the region.","Oct 2, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Helen Regan,Middle East,"CNN — The Middle East is edging ever closer toward a full-blown regional war as Israel vowed to respond to Iran’s huge barrage of ballistic missiles fired at the country on Tuesday night, capping a day of dramatic military escalation in the region. “Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said hours after the unprecedented attack. Iran launched a salvo of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets, its largest ever such attack, sending sirens blaring across Israel and activating the country’s sophisticated defensive systems. Iran’s leadership said the attack was intended as a warning to Israel not to enter a direct war with its longtime enemy, and any Israeli response to the barrage would be met with “stronger and more painful” blows. The escalation came about 24 hours after Israel launched a ground war in Lebanon to go after Hezbollah, a powerful militant group that is backed by Iran, and days after Israel killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah in a strike on Beirut. Here’s what we know. Regional war widens Tuesday’s attack has further changed the dynamics of the conflict, transitioning from a war involving Iran’s proxies toward a direct confrontation between two regional military powerhouses. An Israeli military source told CNN several Iranian missiles struck Israeli military bases during the attack, but insisted there was no major damage to the facilities. It’s the second time Iran has launched an aerial attack on Israel this year, but Tuesday’s barrage was of a different magnitude. In April, Iran launched a large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel – the first such direct assault on the country from its soil – in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria. Israel's anti-missile system intercepts rockets after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, on October 1, 2024. Amir Cohen/Reuters Iran gave 72 hours notice ahead of that attack, which was widely seen as designed to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle with almost all of the 300 projectiles knocked out of the sky by Israel’s defense systems. Israel responded a week later with a limited strike on Iran. This time, Israel learned about the imminent threat just hours before Tehran launched the strikes, with targets including the headquarters of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, in Tel Aviv, Israel’s second largest city, Nevatim Air Base and Tel Nof Air Base. Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran’s Tuesday barrage was twice as large as the April attack. It also included many more ballistic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, posing a real threat to Israeli citizens – many of whom evacuated to shelters during the attack. While the Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, some landed on Israeli soil and appeared to cause damage. Shock waves caused by the attack also damaged homes in central Israel, authorities in the country said. Has diplomacy in the Middle East failed? Diplomacy has so far failed to broker a deal between Israel and Hezbollah, and the ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Hamas and Israel have floundered. Even until a few weeks ago, some senior US officials privately believed that through its diplomatic and deterrence efforts, Washington had helped to successfully thwart a large-scale Iranian attack against Israel, sources told CNN. “I think Nasrallah was the final straw” for Iran, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. With no off-ramp, and Israel appearing unwilling to compromise with its regional enemies, Tuesday’s attack is perhaps the clearest sign a much-feared regional war may be about to ignite. Meanwhile, both Israel and the US downplayed the effectiveness of the strike. Israel said the attack “failed.” How we got here In almost a year of war, increasing escalations have repeatedly brought the region to the edge of an all-out conflict. In recent days, Israel’s ground incursion into southern Lebanon opened up a whole new front and it has ramped up attacks against other Iran-backed militants, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen. Israel has eliminated Hezbollah’s leadership with a series of attacks and massive airstrikes across Lebanon that have targeted the group’s infrastructure and capabilities, but which have also killed more than 1,000 people, displaced about 1 million, and destroyed homes and neighborhoods.

Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images In Gaza, Israel’s war against Hamas grinds on almost a year after the Palestinian militant group’s attack on Israel. The ensuing war has killed more than 41,000 people, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and left much of the enclave in ruins. Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are all part of an Iranian-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war began. They say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. What might both sides do next? Iran has attempted to characterize its attack as a calibrated response to repeated escalations from Israel. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Tuesday’s missile strikes focused on Israeli security and military targets and was in response to Israel’s killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, including Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran in July. Following the assassination of Hamas’ most public figure after attending the inauguration of Iran’s new president, the world held its breath as it waited to see how Tehran would respond. For months, that response never came and tensions appeared to de-escalate given the grave consequences of an all-out war in the Middle East. But Israel’s assassinations and the widening war in Lebanon has rapidly changed that equation. In this screengrab taken from a video, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a meeting with his political-security Cabinet on October 1, 2024. PMO On Saturday, Netanyahu gave a fiery speech directed at Iran, saying Israel was “changing the balance of power in the region” and that “there is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach.” Nasrallah’s death was necessary, he said, to returning thousands of residents to their homes along the Lebanon border displaced by Hezbollah rocket attacks, and to prevent the group from launching a large-scale attack on Israel. US officials have long assessed that both Iran and senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as both have exchanged fire. One big fear for US and Arab diplomats is the possibility of Israel striking inside Iran, potentially against its nuclear facilities. Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett urged Israel to retaliate by destroying its nuclear program. But Iran has made clear that any response from Israel would result in further escalation. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tuesday’s operation was “only a portion of our power.” Israel is likely eyeing Iran’s nuclear facilities as it determines its response to Tehran’s missile attack, according to Malcolm Davis, senior analyst for defense strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “From Israel’s perspective, it cannot allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. There would certainly be strong pressure within Netanyahu’s cabinet to attack those nuclear facilities and essentially set back the Iranian nuclear weapons program, potentially for years,” Davis told CNN’s Becky Anderson. And Hezbollah itself also remains a dangerous adversary for Israel with an arsenal of military assets it could bring to bear. However, Salam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, believes Tehran is likely hoping “there will be some restraint.” “Iran is trying to throw down some red lines, knowing full well that it is in a defensive position, that Hezbollah is compromised, and that it doesn’t have the traditional conventional capabilities to fight Israel,” he told CNN’s Anderson.

US Navy destroyers fired interceptors against the Iranian missiles and in recent weeks, the US has moved more of its troop s and warships to the region. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began, US troops have also been the target of escalating attacks by Iran-backed proxy groups. In January, three US Army soldiers were killed and more than 30 service members injured in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan. During that time, the US has repeatedly stood firm with Israel. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US will “never hesitate” to protect US forces and interest in the Middle East, and that the US remains ready and “postured” to defend its own forces and Israel.

The aerial assault, far more serious than a similar strike in April, has raised the stakes in what is already an extremely tense moment across the Middle East as a dangerous regional conflict spirals. Here’s a look at Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities and the defensive systems employed by Israeli and other forces in the region.

Kenneth McKenzie told Congress in 2023 that Iran had “over 3,000” ballistic missiles, according to a report this year from the Iran Watch website at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Ballistic missiles’ trajectories carry them outside or near the limits of Earth’s atmosphere, before the warhead payload separates from the rocket that carried it aloft and plunges back into the atmosphere and onto its target.

The Shahab-3 is the foundation for all Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles using a liquid propellant, according to Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES). The Missile Threat Project says the Shahab-3 entered service in 2003, can carry a warhead of 760 to 1,200 kilograms (1,675 to 2,645 pounds) and can be fired from mobile launchers as well as silos. Iran Watch says the newest variants of the Shahab-3, the Ghadr and Emad missiles, have accuracies of as close to 300 meters (almost 1,000 feet) of their intended targets.

(AP Photo/Baz Ratner) Baz Ratner/AP Related article With Hezbollah weakened, Israel’s challenge becomes knowing when to pull back Iranian media reported that Tehran used a new missile, the Fattah-1, in the attacks. Tehran describes the Fattah-1 as a “hypersonic” missile – meaning it travels at Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound (about 3,800 miles per hour, 6,100 kilometers per hour). But analysts point out that almost all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic speed during their flights, especially as they dive towards their targets. The term “hypersonic” is often used to refer to what are called hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles, highly advanced weapons that can maneuver at hypersonic speed inside Earth’s atmosphere. That makes such weapons extremely hard to shoot down. Fattah-1 is neither of those, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who wrote on the subject last year. Hinz says the Fattah-1 appears to have a warhead on a “maneuverable reentry vehicle,” which enables it to make adjustments to avoid missile defenses during a short portion of its dive to its target. Still, this ability would be an improvement on Iran’s earlier missiles, Hinz says. But analysts were skeptical that Iran would have used the new missile for the first time on Tuesday night. “It’s one of their newest ballistic missiles, and they have a lot to lose from using it,” said Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army. “Israel would get an idea of its capabilities just from being used. There’s also the chance it could fail to function, giving Israel an even greater idea of its capabilities. They get free propaganda and risk nothing by saying it was used.” Israel’s missile defenses Israel operates a range of systems to block attacks from everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them out of the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets. Much attention has been given to its highly effective Iron Dome system, which is used to combat incoming rockets and artillery weapons. But the Iron Dome is the bottom layer of Israel’s missile defense and is not the system that would have been used to combat the ballistic missiles launched on Tuesday night, according to the country’s Missile Defense Organization (IMDO). The next rung up the missile defense ladder is David’s Sling, which protects against short- and medium-range threats, according to the IMDO.

Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States. The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS. Some 180 ballistic missiles had been launched from Iran against Israel and intercepted in the sky across Israel on October 1, 2024. Matan Golan/SIPAPRE/AP The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the Arrow 2 an upgrade on the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role. Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets. CNN Related article Israel says Iran ‘will pay’ for launching a major missile attack against it During Tuesday night’s attack, the US military said it fired at least 12 anti-missile munitions against the incoming Iranian missiles. The US response came from the Navy guided-missile destroyers USS Cole and USS Bulkeley which were operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said. The Pentagon did not specify the interceptors used, but the US destroyers are equipped with the Aegis ballistic missile defense system, with interceptor missiles that can strike and destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their mid-course or terminal phases. Jordan’s air force also intercepted Iranian missiles on Tuesday night, a Jordanian official said, but no specifics were given. During an Iranian attack on Israel in April, Israeli and US warplanes shot down a large number of the incoming Iranian munitions. But Iran carried out that attack largely with slower-moving drones, which were much easier intercepts for the fighter jets than the ballistic warheads falling vertically on targets in Israel.

CNN teams on the ground in multiple locations in Israel observed dozens of missiles piercing through the skies as sirens blasted across the country. At least one person was killed and several  were injured during the attack, according to the Israeli military. The IDF’s international spokesman Nadav Shoshani told CNN’s Jake Tapper that one Palestinian was killed in Jericho as a result of the attacks. Israel has vowed to respond to the attack – sparking worries among its allies that the conflict in the Middle East could escalate further. Speaking hours after the assault, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies.” Video Ad Feedback Video shows Iranian missiles in the skies across Israel 01:16 - Source: CNN The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. It said it intercepted many of the missiles, although some landed on the ground in Israel and the occupied West Bank. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said later on Tuesday that the attack by Iran was “effectively defeated.” While the attack was over relatively quickly, it is clear that it has further raised the stakes in what is already an extremely tense moment. World leaders have long warned the conflict between Israel and Iran’s proxies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon could spiral into a wider regional war. All eyes will now be on how Israel responds. US President Joe Biden said the United States was “fully supportive” of Israel. But he said his administration was still discussing with Israel what kind of response would be appropriate. “We’re going to get all the data straight, we’re in constant contact with the Israeli government and our counterparts and that remains to be seen,” he said. Israel is already fighting on two fronts. It has been at war with Hamas in Gaza since the deadly October 7 terrorist attack by the group on southern Israel. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, with much of the strip reduced to rubble. And while Israel and Hezbollah have been trading cross-border fire for much of the past year, Iran launched the barrage on Tuesday just hours after Israel announced it launched a “limited and localized” ground operation in Lebanon. Sending Israeli troops into Lebanon would have been seen as a major escalation by Iran. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it targeted Israel in response to the killing of Nasrallah and others, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. After the barrage of missiles was launched, the Iranian mission to the United Nations said that Tehran carried out a response to “the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime.” The mission said on X that if Israel should “dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.” US warned about ‘imminent attack’ The White House warned earlier on Tuesday that Iran was poised to launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel soon, instantly ratcheting up fears of all-out war in the region. People in Tel Aviv and other cities have been told to stay near shelters or other protected areas and the atmosphere on the streets was noticeably tense. Video Ad Feedback National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan gives an update on Iran's attack 01:43 - Source: CNN In a statement released mid-morning, just hours before Tehran launched the attack, the White House said it had “indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel,” adding the United States was “actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack.” Israel assessed that Iran was likely to attack three Israeli air bases and an intelligence base located just north of Tel Aviv, a person briefed on the matter said before the attack. The IRGC said it targeted three Israeli military bases around Tel Aviv, according to the semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News. The intelligence base in Glilot was evacuated Tuesday afternoon, the person said, and the Israeli military has put contingency plans for the safety of personnel at those bases into effect. Two videos from the attack geolocated by CNN showed a number of Iranian missiles striking Nevatim air base in southern Israel based. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the videos, but did not immediately receive a response. Iran previously targeted the same base during a similar April 13 attack. Israel weighing its response US and Arab diplomats have been concerned about the scale of Israel’s response. One major concern on their mind is Israel possibly using a forthcoming Iranian strike to respond by striking inside Iran, potentially against its nuclear facilities. “There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that’s true of the entire Middle East,” Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said during his speech at the United Nations last week. The US was earlier prepared to do whatever it can to help Israel intercept anything Iran directed its way, similar to how the US offered its assistance in April , when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles towards Israel — the vast majority of which were successfully intercepted, a US official said. After the attack, Biden praised the role US played in thwarting Iran’s missiles, calling the attack “defeated and ineffective.” “This is testament to Israeli military capability, and US military. It’s also a testament to intensive planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack we expected,” he said. Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the attack and said she supported Biden’s decision to direct US military to help Israel shoot down Iranian missiles. Harris, who is the Democratic presidential nominee, said she was in the Situation Room earlier on Tuesday alongside Biden, and received updates from their national security team, adding that they “ensured that the protection of US personnel in the region is paramount.” Meanwhile, former president and the Republican nominee Donald Trump argued Iran launched the attack because “they don’t respect our country anymore,” and argued the US was diminished on the world stage because of Biden and Harris’ leadership.

Israel has described its initial ground incursion into southern Lebanon as such, although its key ally, the Biden administration, has already suggested that what may initially begin as small in scope could risk dragging on . It will take a remarkable amount of efficiency and discipline from the Israeli military and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to know when it is time to stop. Militaries are not particularly keen on pulling back, especially in large scale operations. If the incursion is easygoing, it could incentivize the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to push forward, sensing a weakened enemy against which swift progress can be made. If the going gets tough, the IDF can suggest the mission is more imperative than ever, and that they must push on. But, quite remarkably after two weeks of technological wizardry and ruthless, calculated attacks against Hezbollah – starting with the simultaneous explosion of communication devices and culminating in the killing of the militant group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah – the playing field may shift. The Israeli military are now walking into the ground trap that their adversary has been setting for them for well over a decade. IDF video Related video IDF releases footage showing underground tunnels in Lebanon They may discover that Hezbollah, its leadership decapitated , is so enfeebled that it is genuinely a less challenging task than imagined to mop up what remains of its ground troops after months of heavy airstrikes. But southern Lebanon was always going to be where the Iran-backed group held the home advantage. Its tunnel network provides them an endless maze for Israeli forces. And so, knowing when to stop is going to be key to this not becoming a quagmire for Israel. Almost every modern war that has dragged on for years began with the idea that it would all be over in a matter of weeks. While Israel’s operations over the past three weeks have been brutal, they have shown discipline and superior intelligence. But we’re now entering a new phase of this conflict in which key decisions must be made by an Israeli prime minister who was has shown himself to be maximalist in his military steps, and who is also desperately in need of a prolonged conflict to maintain his grip on power. It is going to take some extraordinarily swift dismantling of Hezbollah by the IDF for Netanyahu to be able to pull his forces out in a matter of days, and avoid months of not quite being sure how this all ends. Does Israel’s Lebanon operation increase the chances of wider war with Iran? The US warned Tuesday of a possible retaliatory ballistic missile strike by Iran on Israel, but that does not translate in to guaranteed damage, given the April interceptions of dozens of similar rockets, and Iran has clearly shown that - so far - it does not have the resources nor the willingness to lead a wider regional response against Israel. Smoke billows near a village in southern Lebanon after an Israeli airstrike, as seen from northern Israel on October 1, 2024. Jim Urquhart/Reuters But this is also an increased hazard for the civilians of Lebanon and some form of enduring peace, or at least sustainable calm, in the region. The less likely a wider conflagration is, the less leverage the US and Europe have over the Netanyahu administration. Time and again the West has managed to pull the region back from a brink they have said is perilously close. But now all the red lines to Israel’s north have literally seen troops march over them, and it really is not clear if Iran has any viable means of intervention at this time, outside of missile attacks that it has tried before to little avail. Yet the arc of retaliation is long, and Iran may exact retribution in ways not imminent yet still horrifically destabilizing – such as its very advanced nuclear program. But immediately they don’t seem to be able to deter Israel in any way. IDF Related article Israeli troops have launched a ground offensive in southern Lebanon. Here’s what we know And so, a fearful month begins, bedeviled by US electoral paralysis, in which any notions of the outgoing Biden administration being able to rein in Israel seem a little fanciful. The White House is, it seems, being told about huge escalations, like the assassination of Nasrallah last week, as they actually happen. If US Vice President Kamala Harris wins, her White House may decide to switch off the taps and slow Israel’s moves. And even Donald Trump, who seems to want all wars to stop, may have less of an appetite for a lengthy Israeli operation deep inside Lebanon that he ends up partially paying for. But on the hustings neither candidate wants to give the other the chance of labeling them weak on defending Israel. Netanyahu’s full intentions remain unclear. The closure of towns around Metula in northern Israel and shelling across the border has led to some speculation the IDF might be attempting a lightning race West towards the Lebanese city of Tyre, effectively cutting off all of Hezbollah in the country’s south. While this may be attractive strategically on a map, it is potentially a huge task with a lot of unkind geography in its way. But this is emblematic of the extraordinary jeopardy Israel now finds itself in. With a maximalist leader who had appeared to have shunned all diplomacy, it must now set a limited scope on an operation that it also hopes can permanently redefine the security threat to its north. It must find a way of inflicting significant damage on an adversary that has never been so weak, but also avoid getting caught in a trap. The Israeli prime minister has sanctioned actions over the past fortnight that have seemed tactically astute despite an apparent disregard for civilian casualties. But they are an outlier in the scope of the past year. The open sore of Gaza – a conflict without a perceivable end, or idea solution for coexistence and political accommodation for the Palestinians – shows how belligerent the current war cabinet can be when faced with larger strategic decisions. For Israel’s military endeavor to last weeks and not months, they will need extraordinary and rare success, discipline, and political wisdom."

Here’s what we know,"Israel has launched a ground operation across its northern border into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, opening a new and dangerous phase in almost a year of war.","Oct 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Helen Regan,Middle East,"CNN — Israel has launched a ground operation across its northern border into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, opening a new and dangerous phase in almost a year of war. The incursion, which Israel’s National Security Cabinet has called the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, marks the fourth time that Israeli soldiers have publicly entered Lebanese soil in nearly 50 years, and the first since Israel’s 34-day war in the country in 2006. Israeli troops laid the groundwork for what it called a “limited ground operation” in recent days, ramping up airstrikes that have killed hundreds of people, destroyed homes and displaced about 1 million people in Lebanon. The latest escalation comes after Israel killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on Friday and decimated the leadership of the most powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East. Here’s what we know. Extent of incursion unclear Israeli officials have characterized the incursion into southern Lebanon as limited in scope, saying there will be “no long-term occupation.” Officials have, however, declined to say how deep Israeli troops would venture into the country or how long the operation is expected to last. On Tuesday, the Israeli military called on residents in more than two dozen villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate approximately 30 miles into the country. An Israeli security official told reporters on condition of anonymity Tuesday morning that the operation does not amount to an invasion or incursion, describing it instead as “localized raids” that are “very limited in scope and in the area of operation.” The official said there were so far “no clashes” on the ground between the IDF and Hezbollah, but refused to comment on whether Israeli tanks have entered Lebanon and would not elaborate on how deep into Lebanese territory Israeli troops have advanced, saying they were focused on the border areas. “The amount of forces and the type of forces are more appropriate to something of a limited raid, and not, for example, things we’ve seen in Gaza with very, very large forces,” the official added. Hezbollah rejected the claim that Israeli forces had entered southern Lebanon, describing them as “lies,” according to a statement by spokesman Mohamed Afif on Tuesday. A source from the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said the Israeli military has staged some “sporadic raids” across the Lebanon-Israel border but its troops have not remained on Lebanese soil. The assessment that Israel has not yet launched a full-scale invasion was supported by two other high-level Lebanese security sources. A man stands on the rubble of buildings near the site of the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's southern suburbs, on September 29, 2024. Hassan Ammar/AP The Israeli military earlier said it was focused on removing “immediate threats” from Lebanese villages along the border, including Hezbollah’s ability to infiltrate northern Israel. Israeli soldiers, including paratroopers and commandos, as well as armored corps troops have been “preparing for limited, localized, targeted operations in southern Lebanon,” the Israeli military said , adding that soldiers have been training for weeks and had gained skills and operational experience in Gaza over many months. While the extent of Israel’s military plans inside Lebanon remain unclear, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become increasingly defiant of international calls for restraint and de-escalation, as well as widespread outrage over growing civilian casualties in Lebanon and Gaza. Previous military operations initially declared by Israel to be limited in their goals have proved to be anything but. Examples include Israel’s years-long occupation of southern Lebanon that began in 1982 with the stated aim of a brief and limited mission to destroy the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in the country. More recently, Israel’s military declared a “limited” operation in Rafah, southern Gaza that has left the city in ruins. What happened ahead of the incursion? Shortly before the incursion, Israel’s National Security Cabinet approved the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, according to Israeli media. In preparation, the Israeli military launched small raids and artillery fire across the Lebanon border, and sealed off several communities in northern Israel, limiting the movement of civilians there. The Lebanese army had also evacuated observation posts at the southern border and moved to barracks in the border villages, according to a Lebanese security source. The Army Command later denied reports it withdrew. CNN is unable to independently verify the Lebanese army’s movements. Meanwhile, Israel’s air force once again bombed the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut, predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah has a stronghold. It follows Israeli airstrikes that hit inside Beirut’s city limits early Monday for the first time since the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel. The Lebanese health ministry said on Monday that at least 95 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in just 24 hours, and another 172 others injured.

Why are Israeli troops now in Lebanon? Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah have been engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation since the war in Gaza began following Hamas’ attack on Israel last October. Hezbollah first attacked Israel on October 8 and has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave, much of which has been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombs and fighting. In recent weeks, Israel has refocused its military objectives north with a new war aim to return displaced residents to their homes along the Lebanon border. About 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah’s rocket attacks. What’s unfolded is some of the fiercest fighting between the two longtime foes since the 2006 Lebanon war, which killed 1,100 in the country. Nearly 50 Israeli civilians and 121 Israeli soldiers were also killed. Last month, pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon in a coordinated Israeli attack that killed dozens of people and maimed thousands, including women and children. Israel has also stepped up a relentless bombing campaign across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure and leadership, but the strikes have also decimated homes and neighborhoods in densely populated areas. Massive airstrikes in southern Beirut have killed a string of Hezbollah leaders , as well as more than 1,000 people. The Iran question The latest developments raise questions about how a weakened Hezbollah will respond, and the extent to which its backer Iran could get involved, once more ratcheting up fears of a wider regional war . Hezbollah is part of an Iran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began.

Reuters Related article What might come next as Hezbollah reels from Nasrallah’s killing and Israel mulls a Lebanon ground incursion? In a fiery speech on Sunday, Netanyahu said one of Israel’s goals is “changing the balance of power in the region” and that “there is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach.” Killing Hezbollah leader Nasrallah and wiping out the group’s capabilities to launch a large-scale attack on Israel were “necessary” conditions to achieve that goal, he said. Israel has also ramped up attacks on multiple fronts against other Iran-backed militants, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen . But despite the recent Israeli strikes on its proxies, Iran has appeared wary of moving into direct conflict with its longtime enemy, even as their decades-long shadow war has been pushed further into the open. Many observers fear any direct Iranian retaliation could draw the United States further into the conflict. In a weekly news conference on Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani described Israel’s actions in Lebanon as “criminal,” and said that while the Islamic Republic is “not a warmonger… No measures and adventurism against Iran’s national security will go unanswered,” state-run IRNA reported. How has the US reacted? Attention has focused on how the once-mighty US is increasingly powerless to rein in its ally or to influence other major belligerents in a fast-worsening regional crisis . US officials told CNN they were informed by their Israeli counterparts that the incursion into Lebanon was expected to be limited in scope and duration. 30 September 2024, Lebanon, Qliyaa: Heavy smoke of Israeli air raids billows from the southern Lebanese border town Khiam.

President Joe Biden last week unveiled a 21-day ceasefire proposal , backed by other US allies, that was almost immediately rejected by Netanyahu – to the frustration of the White House. The US is a key provider of Israel’s weapons — it likely supplied the 2,000-pound bombs used to kill Hezbollah’s leader — but Biden and his advisers have continued to call for a diplomatic resolution. How has the world responded? Several states and UN bodies have warned of the impact on civilians in Lebanon and the risk of further regional instability. The European Union renewed its call for an immediate ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. In a statement on Monday, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell called for “the respect of international humanitarian law in all circumstances,” and said the “sovereignty of both Israel and Lebanon has to be guaranteed.” UNIFIL said in a statement that “any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity,” urging “all actors to step back from such escalatory acts which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed,” it added.” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot urged Israel on Monday “to refrain from any ground incursion” into Lebanon, and called on both sides to agree to a ceasefire. The United Arab Emirates expressed “deep concern” over the recent escalations, fearing its “impact on regional stability,” the state-run Emirates News Agency (WAM) reported, adding that the Gulf state “reaffirmed its unwavering position towards the unity of Lebanon, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity.” The UAE also directed an urgent $100 million relief package to the people of Lebanon. Jordan expressed “its rejection of the Israeli aggression” against Lebanon. Saudi Arabia said it “stresses the need to preserve Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” while Qatar expressed solidarity with Lebanon as well as “readiness to provide support to the people to confront the consequences of the Israeli aggression.” Turkey condemned Israel’s ground operation, calling it “a violation of sovereignty and an unlawful act of occupation,” according to the state-run Anadolu news agency . The United Nations’ agency for humanitarian emergencies (OCHA) warned of the devastating impact on civilians of the recent escalations in Lebanon. The UN agency urged the international community to “urgently promote de-escalation and ensure that all parties respect international humanitarian law, while prioritizing immediate humanitarian assistance to the affected people.” The UN’s World Food Programme has also launched an emergency project to scale up food assistance for up to 1 million people in need in Lebanon.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Monday launched the next stage of its onslaught against Hezbollah with what the Israel Defense Forces called a “limited ground operation” into Lebanon — despite weeks of requests from Washington for restraint and familiar (and spurned) calls for de-escalation. This came just hours after President Joe Biden said “we should have a ceasefire now,” when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces’ previous raids into southern Lebanon. “I’m comfortable with them stopping,” the president said. His comments only underscored the chasm between the US and Israeli governments on a day when Netanyahu told Iranians in a broadcast, “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.” The disconnect is widening as it coincides with the endgame of a cliffhanger US election. Biden’s room for maneuver is limited if he is to avoid exacerbating the domestic political impact of war in the Middle East — a factor Netanyahu, a consummate operator in US politics, surely understands. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, has largely stuck to the administration line — despite earlier comments that suggested she might take a slightly harder rhetorical stance toward Netanyahu while emphasizing the plight of Palestinian civilians. Video Ad Feedback Sen. Chris Van Hollen: 'Unacceptable' to transfer offensive weapons to Israel unless our values are met 13:55 - Source: CNN A humiliating pattern for the US on repeat The pattern of American impotency and Israeli defiance has played repeatedly since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, which prompted the Israeli pounding of Gaza and the more recent attempt to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu often acts first and consults the US later, even when his actions are certain to buckle American diplomatic efforts and compound fears the US will get dragged into a disastrous regional war. The US was not informed in advance, for example, about the Israeli airstrike Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah even though its global shockwaves were bound to be severe. This Israeli approach has often made the Biden administration appear a spectator rather than an active player in events, as should befit a superpower. Months of grueling shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Antony Blinken have mostly drawn a blank. And the US has incessantly pushed for a Gaza ceasefire that neither Netanyahu nor Hamas seems to want. This is not just a diplomatic embarrassment. Any time an American president is publicly spurned, there is a cost to their personal prestige and perceptions of US global power. And the likelihood is growing that Biden, who came to office professing to be a foreign policy expert, will leave the White House in a few months with a raging Middle East war set to stain his legacy. But the Israeli leader’s bet that, for all its reservations, the Biden administration will remain the guarantor of the Jewish state’s security has paid off. For instance, the US and its allies helped repel a massive Iranian missile and drone attack against Israel in April. The strikes followed an Israeli strike that the US didn’t know about in advance on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus that killed eight senior Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers. And so far, Biden, who has long prided himself on being one of the most pro-Israeli politicians in US history, has been loath to use the leverage he does have — for instance, permanently cutting off US military supplies for Israel, a step that would have huge political reverberations ahead of the election and leave him accused of deserting an ally fighting terror. Netanyahu often seems to be taking conscious advantage of Biden’s instincts, reasoning he’ll swallow any level of provocation. A deep symbolic irony encapsulates the duality of the US position in the conflict: a CNN analysis found that American-manufactured 2,000-pound bombs were likely used in the attack on Nasrallah, which threatens to ignite the regional conflagration that would be so ruinous to US interests and diplomatic goals. The price of US-Israeli tensions But the months of Israeli disregard for the administration’s political and strategic concerns have come at a stiff cost. Relations between Biden and Netanyahu are very tense. And growing antagonism often bursts into the open — most recently when US officials were furious the Israeli leader dissed an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire proposal by a groups of nations led by the US. Washington demanded the Israelis put out a statement to remedy the diplomatic embarrassment, CNN’s MJ Lee, Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hansler reported last week. Ret. Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on “CNN This Morning” that conversations between Israeli and US officials ahead of the expected Israeli move into southern Lebanon were “pretty tense … especially at the upper levels.” He added: “The key thing to keep in mind is that Israel has basically deliberately kept the US uninformed when it came to the details of their operations.” On the one side, Leighton said, “The US is trying to restrain the Israelis; they’re trying to limit the scope of military action that the Israelis are conducting. The Israelis are looking at this from a military standpoint right now, and they’re seeing the capability and the possibility of going and basically eliminating Hezbollah as a threat to northern Israel and potentially as a threat at all.” Why has the US-Israeli split widened? The last year’s events have forced the United States and Israel into a situation in which the critical national interests of each state as perceived by its elected leaders are in direct conflict. The Netanyahu government interpreted the October 7 attacks as a graphic manifestation of an existential threat to the state of Israel and Jews in the Middle East. With that mindset, even intense ill feeling with the White House can be tolerated. And the sense that Israel is waging a battle for its survival makes it easier for leaders to justify to themselves the massive Palestinian civilian casualties from Israeli actions against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, even if the rest of the world sees the carnage as heinously disproportionate. The United States might warn against the threat of a regional war, but Israel believes it’s been embroiled in such a conflict for years against proxy groups taking direction or inspiration from its enemies in Iran’s clerical leadership. But events look different through Washington’s wider strategic and historic lens amid worries that Israel’s short-term victories are not sustainable and may simply be laying the predicate for decades more insecurity and warfare. America’s national interests do not just lie in the preservation of Israel. The White House is desperate to avoid being sucked into another bitter conflict in the Middle East, given the two decades it took to extract American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Outposts of US soldiers still in the region, including in Syria and Iraq, also remain highly vulnerable to attacks by Iranian proxies as the deaths of three US service personnel in a drone attack on Jordan in January showed. The global and political implications of the year of rage in the region are also huge. For instance, months of attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have seen US and allied naval forces often under fire and intercepting missiles from Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Cascading economic impacts from slowed supply chains, as shipping lines send cargo on a longer route around Africa, are also considerable. The clashes are unlikely to end while Israel blasts Gaza and Lebanon. Israeli thinks it’s winning, fueling its reluctance to stop There are also contrasting military perceptions between Israel and the US. Israel has wiped out many of its most dangerous enemies in stunning intelligence and military actions. In addition to the elimination of Nasrallah, who built Hezbollah into a grave threat to Israel in 30 years, Hamas has also accused Israel of killing Ismail Haniyeh, one of its top leaders, in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. It has also killed other senior members of the two groups in strikes in Syria, Lebanon, Iran and in Gaza. Israeli-detonated attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies injured or killed thousands of Hezbollah operatives. So why would Netanyahu not press ahead with the greatest Israeli strategic success in decades whatever Biden says? But Washington has much wider concerns. They include the horrendous civilian casualties and humanitarian disasters in Gaza and Lebanon, a state that has enjoyed a few decades of comparative stability after a murderous civil war, which raged between 1975 and 1990, and caused considerable US bloodshed. The deaths of thousands of civilians is not just a tragedy in itself, it creates severe pressure on the US from its allies and tarnishes America’s image by association. The longer the war goes on, the greater the threat that conflicts intensifying across the region could all join into one perilous multi-front war and that a direct conflict could break out between the US and its arch enemy Iran. A regional war would have disastrous economic consequences and could further deflect from the US goal of mobilizing for its new superpower showdown with China. Venomous politics are changing long-held truths about the US-Israel relationship There are also intractable political factors pulling the governments apart. For most of Israel’s existence, it would have been politically and strategically ruinous for a prime minister to show such contempt for a US president. But Netanyahu’s own march to the far right and the reliance of his coalition on ultra-orthodox parties means that his priority is appeasing the most extreme domestic elements to stay in power. The weakness of centrist and left-wing parties in Israel means a dearth of alternative leaders like late prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin or Shimon Peres, who were ideologically and temperamentally in tune with US presidents. The rise of incendiary and radical leaders like Nasrallah and Hamas officials also means there are no partners on the other side open to traditional US peacemaking. Even legendary US secretary of state and peace-shuttler James Baker would have struggled with this regional cast of characters. American calls for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict may ultimately reflect the only possible route to an ending of a generationslong confrontation — but they also seem utterly divorced from the realities of the blood-soaked Middle East in 2024. And many observers in Washington have long suspected that Netanyahu has a strong personal interest in perpetually waging war to redeem his own failure to stop the October 7 attacks and to keep postponing his legal reckoning as he faces serious criminal charges. America’s own venomous political reality is also eroding US power in the Middle East. Support for Israel was once an unshakable principle that united Republicans and Democrats. But Netanyahu’s meddling in US politics for years — over the Iranian nuclear issue, for instance — has alienated many Democrats and their party’s move to the left has further tempered backing for Israel. Ex-President Donald Trump indulged and encouraged the most radical of Netanyahu’s policies — further politicizing the US-Israel relationship. And pro-Trump Republicans are goading him to go further — at least partly to weaken Biden and his chosen successor, Harris. Biden and Harris are in a dicey political spot a month before the election. Biden’s failure to rein in Israel in Gaza and now Lebanon – and the consequential human carnage – has split the Democratic Party and threatens to drive down turnout among progressives and Arab American voters, especially in swing states like Michigan. But any move to punish Israel could damage Harris among moderate and swing state voters, who are being barraged with negative Trump ads claiming she and Biden are weak and leading the United States into World War III. This is just one of many reasons why Netanyahu is incentivized to expand his war no matter how powerless it makes America look. This story has been updated with additional developments."

Joint defenses are being prepared to ward off an attack with changes in US military posture, the official added. The Biden administration spearheaded a multi-national defense of Israel in mid-April when Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel in response to the Israeli bombing of senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers in Syria. The US official declined to say what kind of attack is expected from Iran or specify the moves the US military is making. Fears of a broader regional war in the Middle East have spiked in recent weeks as Israel intensifies its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Iran-backed group vows to continue its fight, even as a growing number of its top commander have been killed. The Pentagon said in a statement Sunday night that “should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people.” Defense Department Spokesman Gen. Patrick Ryder noted “a significant amount of capability in the region,” including the USS Abrahm Lincoln Carrier Strike Group. Nasrallah was killed in a massive Israeli bombing in southern Beirut on Friday. He led the most powerful of Iran’s Middle East proxies for decades and his death is a potentially crippling setback for Hezbollah as well as a major blow to Iran’s control in the region. Biden administration officials are also defending their decision to announce the “breakthrough” of a ceasefire proposal last week between Israel and Hezbollah that quickly turned into an embarrassment for the administration when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear Israeli forces would instead continue to pound the Lebanese militant group. US officials argue that Israel changed its mind Wednesday night after the proposal – which was signed onto by 11 other allies - was announced. Israel decided they had an opportunity to target Nasrallah, a US official said. The US official told CNN the US-led statement issued Wednesday had been greenlit by Israel after working on it together for several days. On a hastily-arranged call that night, senior Biden administration officials told reporters with confidence: “the ceasefire will be for 21 days” across the Lebanon-Israel border. They believed it would go into effect quickly so that diplomatic efforts could take over to lead to a more permanent truce. But hours later Netanyahu said Israel “will continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might.” Israeli officials tried to explain what happened as an “honest misunderstanding.” They say they thought what the US, France and other countries were proposing “was the start of a process that could ultimately lead to a ceasefire.” But “Americans thought it was the end of the process and the start of a ceasefire,” a senior Israeli official told CNN. What gave American officials confidence was that they had been dealing directly with one of Netanyahu’s closest aides, Ron Dermer. He and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had launched the discussions two days prior, on Monday. The US official claimed on Sunday that the administration retreated from pushing last week’s ceasefire plan once they learned Israel may try to take out Nasrallah. But the White House insists the efforts to reach a diplomatic solution in order to get tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli civilians back to their homes are still alive. “I think what we would agree on is that there needs to be an effort to de-escalate here,” the White House’s national security spokesman John Kirby told CNN on Sunday. “We believe and continue to believe that an all-out war with Hezbollah, certainly with Iran, is not the way to do that. If you want to get those folks back home safely and sustainably, we believe that a diplomatic path is the right path,” he added."

Israel’s leader sees an opportunity opening up for a fundamental reconfiguration of power in Middle East and he may assume that Hezbollah are mortally wounded. Total victory, however, is elusive, and those who get what they wish for often live to regret it. Since Sept 17, Israel has dealt the Iran-backed militant group one body blow after another in Lebanon — first the pager and walkie talkie blasts, then a massive air strike on southern Beirut which killed senior commander Ibrahim Aqil (along with at least two dozen civilians), followed three days later by the start of a brutal bombing campaign. By Friday evening – when Nasrallah was killed in a bombing that flattened multiple buildings – Hizballah’s senior leadership had been almost totally eliminated.

Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images Related live-story Hezbollah leader’s killing escalates war with Israel Yet recent history offers only bitter lessons for Israeli leaders — and others — who entertain grand ambitions for tectonic changes in Lebanon, and in the Middle East in general. In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the goal of crushing the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Beyond that, it hoped to establish a malleable Christian-dominated government in Beirut and to drive Syrian forces out of the country. It failed at all three. Yes, Palestinian armed groups in Lebanon were compelled to leave the country under an American-brokered deal that sent them into exile in Tunisia, Yemen and elsewhere. But the goal of quashing Palestinian national aspirations along with the PLO failed. Five years later, the First Palestinian Intifada, or uprising,broke out in Gaza and spread to the West Bank. Today the Palestinians are as adamant and restive as they’ve ever been in their rejection of Israeli occupation. Two Lebanese women walk in a West Beirut street devastated by Israeli shelling during the ""Operation Peace for Galilee"" on July 24, 1982. Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images Israel’s main ally in Lebanon at the time of the invasion was Bashir Al-Gemayel, a Maronite Christian militia leader who was elected by parliament, but before he took office was assassinated in a massive blast in east Beirut. His brother, Amin, replaced him, and under his leadership and with active American involvement and encouragement in May 1983 Lebanon and Israel signed an agreement for the establishment of normal bilateral relations. In the face of intense opposition, the government fell the following February and soon the agreement was abrogated. The US, which had deployed troops to Beirut after the September 1982 Sabra-Shatila massacres, pulled out after its embassy was twice bombed, along with the US marines and French army barracks in October 1983. The Lebanese civil war re-erupted and raged on more than six years. Syrian forces, which had entered Lebanon in 1976 as a “deterrence force” under an Arab League mandate, didn’t leave until 2005 after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the 1982 Israeli invasion was the birth of Hezbollah, which went on to wage a relentless guerrilla war that compelled Israel to unilaterally withdraw from south Lebanon – significantly the first and only time an Arab military force successfully pushed Israel to retreat from Arab land. This new group, with Iran’s help, proved to be far more lethal and effective than the Palestinian militants Israel had successfully driven out. Hezbollah went on to fight Israel to a standstill in the 2006 war, and in the following years grew only stronger, with significant Iranian help.

Clipped From Video video Related video Kirby: ‘I don’t think anybody’s mourning’ Nasrallah but ‘there needs to be an effort to de-escalate’ Beyond Lebanon and Israel, there is the example of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, a lesson in the wages of unfettered hubris. As the Iraqi army crumbled and US troops raced to Baghdad, the George W. Bush administration entertained fantasies that the fall of Saddam Hussein would lead to the toppling of regimes in Tehran and Damascus, and ignite a flowering of liberal democracies across the region. Instead the US occupation of Iraq descended into a blood bath of sectarian violence, in which the US paid dearly in blood and treasure, the people of Iraq even more. The killing of Saddam Hussain allowed Iran to spread its influence to the very heart of the political establishment in Baghdad. Al-Qaeda, shattered by the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, was reborn in Iraq’s Sunni triangle, and eventually morphed into the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. As I write this, I see smoke rising from across Beirut’s battered southern suburbs and recall the words of then-US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who, during the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war, said all the bloodshed and destruction we were witnessing then were “the birth pangs of the new Middle East.” Beware of those who promise a new dawn, the birth of a new Middle East, a new balance of power in the region. Lebanon is a microcosm of all that can go wrong. It’s the land of unintended consequences."

The Iran-backed group’s long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed on Friday in a massive bombardment that was the first of the nearly 48 hours of incessant airstrikes. Scores of top commanders and officials were killed alongside him as well as in the attacks that followed. Many civilians are also believed to have been killed. More than 24 hours after Nasrallah’s body was recovered from the deep pit left behind by the heavy bombs that killed him, a funeral for the militant leader is yet to be scheduled – highly unusual in Islamic tradition where the dead receive a quick burial. The group is also yet to appoint a new secretary general, defying long-held expectations that the group would rapidly unfurl a succession plan after Nasrallah’s death.

History has a warning This has added to a pervading sense that Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group which for decades dominated the country’s politics, had swiftly become a ghost organization. In one fell swoop, Israel seemed to remove not just the group’s leadership, but perhaps also all its contingency plans , further evidence of the profound scope of Israel’s infiltration of the group’s ranks. “It’s fabricated. There’s no proof that he’s dead,” said Hassan, a Hezbollah supporter leaning on a parked moped, his eyes glassy with tears. “He’s going to appear soon and he’s going to surprise us.” Abu Mohamad, a middle-aged Shia man displaced from southern Lebanon to a sidewalk in central Beirut, said, “It doesn’t matter if he’s alive or dead, because a leader like Nasrallah lives in us always,” he said. “We will continue on the path he set, and we will return to our homes.” Nasrallah inspired strong feelings in the Lebanese – revered and reviled in equal measure.

Umm Mohammed and her five-year-old son escaped the Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon, displaced to a tarpaulin on a seaside boardwalk. Jomana Karadsheh/CNN Lebanese authorities believe just under 1,100 people have been killed and around 1 million have been displaced by Israel’s intensified bombardment campaign since it began last Monday. A response, Israel says, to the rocket attacks from Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas attacked on October 7, and which have forced 60,000 people from their homes in northern Israel. Lebanon’s border villages have also been emptied of around 100,000 villagers by Israeli attacks in turn. Still, Hezbollah has vowed to keep up its border rocket fire until the end of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Now, large parts of the densely populated southern suburbs have been devastated. The displaced have taken to the relatively affluent, and still untouched, western parts of the capital where they have camped out on sidewalks, parks, schools, churches and mosques.

Many of the country’s displaced have lost loved ones but can barely find the time to grieve as they scramble for shelter and food. Those not yet personally impacted by the bombardment must contend with the unknown territory into which the death of Nasrallah and his cadre of senior leaders has thrust the country. “The assassination of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah came to open a wound in the heart of the Lebanese,” the Patriarch of the Maronite Church, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi said at Sunday Mass. Rahi has long been one of Hezbollah’s most prominent critics. In January he implicitly criticized Hezbollah for dragging the south of Lebanon into conflict with its cross-border rocket and drone attacks on Israel. Hezbollah has repeatedly vowed not to cease fire on its southern border until the end of Israel’s ongoing offensive in Gaza. Rahi had also condemned “the culture of death that has brought nothing but imaginary victories and shameful defeats to our country.” Nasrallah’s main Sunni foes have also condemned the assassination. “The assassination of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has brought Lebanon and the region to a new phase of violence. It was a cowardly act that we condemn in every way,” Lebanon’s former Prime Minister Saad Hariri said in a post on X. “We disagreed a lot with the late (Nasrallah) and with his party, and we met infrequently. However Lebanon serves as a tent for all, and in these extremely challenging times, our unity and our solidarity remains foundational,” Hariri continued. Lebanon’s complex confessional power-sharing structure has mean that divisions frequently spark internal strife, political paralysis and even violence. But Israel, technically classified in Lebanon as an “enemy state,” has historically brought the fragmented country together, albeit temporarily. Meanwhile, civilians wandering the streets for safety have borne the cost of this new war.

A visual guide,Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Here’s a look at their military arsenal and how it compares to Israel.,"Sep 29, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Lou Robinson,Middle East,"CNN — Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Backed by Iran and based in the eastern Mediterranean country of Lebanon, the Shiite Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks. Cross-border hostilities have since escalated, culminating in the death of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut. The cross-border conflict and recent developments have raised the specter of a regional conflagration and amplified intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel. Israel would also have to contend with Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The group is part of an Iran-led axis of militants spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq. Some of these groups have increased coordination significantly since October, when Israel launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked the country. This axis is known in Israel as the “ring of fire.” For nearly a year, Hezbollah’s partners in the region have been engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies. Yemen’s Houthis have sporadically fired at vessels in the Red Sea, an artery of global trade, as well as on Israel. Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of hardline Shiite factions, has also launched attacks on US positions in that country. The axis has conditioned the cessation of those hostilities on a ceasefire in Gaza, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in Gaza, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader. In September, Israel stepped up its direct confrontation with Hezbollah. In back-to-back attacks , hundreds of Hezbollah’s pagers and walkie-talkies exploded, killing at least 37 people and injuring thousands, before an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander. In response, Hezbollah has vowed “a battle without limits.” Following the twin communications attacks, Hezbollah launched what it said was a ballistic missile at Israel, targeting the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad. It is believed to be the first ballistic missile to be launched by militant group toward Israel. The strike, which was intercepted, reached near the bustling city of Tel Aviv. Hezbollah’s fighting force emerged from the rubble of Israel’s 1982 invasion of Beirut. At the time, it was a rag-tag group of Islamist fighters supported by Iran’s fledgling Islamic Republic. This was followed by a meteoric rise in the group’s military and political might. In 2000, its guerrilla fighters forced Israeli forces to withdraw from south Lebanon, ending a more-than-20-year occupation. In 2006, it survived a 34-day war with Israel that wreaked havoc on Lebanon. During Syria’s uprising-turned-civil war in the 2010s, it fought on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as he brutally quashed armed opposition forces and inflicted a huge civilian death toll. As it fought in the trenches of that nearly decade-long war, Hezbollah became seasoned in urban warfare and solidified its alliances with other Iran-backed groups fighting in Syria. It also cleared a vital supply route for weapons between Iran and Lebanon, via its partners in Iraq and Syria, further bolstering its arsenal. Hezbollah’s military capabilities have notably grown since its last war with Israel in 2006. Military analysts estimate Hezbollah to have between 30,000 and 50,000 troops, but earlier this year its leader Nasrallah claimed it has more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles. Experts say the group’s biggest military asset is the long-range ballistic missile, of which it is estimated to have thousands, including 1,500 precision missiles with ranges of 250–300 kilometers (155–186 miles). Throughout its decades-long conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has been engaged in asymmetric warfare. It has sought to grow its political and military might, while seeking to establish deterrence despite Israel’s military superiority. But Hezbollah threads the needle carefully. Provoking Israel’s full firepower could significantly degrade the group’s capabilities, setting it back years – if not decades – and destroying large parts of Lebanon, which has buckled under the weight of its years-long financial crisis. The group has already lost more than around 500 fighters, including commanders, in border confrontations with Israel since October, according to Hezbollah statements and a CNN tally. On the Lebanese side of the border, over 94,000 people have been displaced. The impact on Israel has also been considerable, with more than 62,000 people displaced from its northern border area, and scores killed, including soldiers and civilians. As the confrontations at the border continue, Hezbollah has sought, with some success, to undermine Israel’s vaunted missile defense system known as the Iron Dome. It has tried to do so by attacking its platforms and overwhelming it with swarms of drones and short-range missiles in order to open a path for other projectiles to reach deeper into Israeli territory. The full extent of Hezbollah’s arsenal is not clear. In response to Israel’s twin wireless device attacks, Hezbollah fired a barrage of missiles across the border into northern Israel, and said it hit an air base with Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles – a longer-range weapon not known to have been used so far in nearly a year of conflict. Hezbollah’s chances of survival in an all-out war with Israel is hinged on whether or not it can outsmart these systems which have in recent months intercepted thousands of airborne weapons from Iran, Gaza and Lebanon.

Nasrallah’s killing, in a huge set of Israeli airstrikes on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday, marks a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group, which has been firing on Israel since the start of its war against Hamas in Gaza. It is also the latest in a string of major blows to Hezbollah, which has now lost multiple commanders and was already reeling after pagers and walkie-talkies owned by its members exploded earlier this month, killing dozens and maiming thousands. Israel has warned that a “new era” of war was beginning with its “center of gravity” moving north, in a reference to the Lebanon border. One of its stated war aims is to return tens of thousands of its own civilians displaced by cross-border fighting. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Lebanon due to the recent fighting, while more than a thousand have been killed since the airstrikes escalated last week, according to Lebanese government officials. Israel has raised the possibility of a ground incursion into Lebanon, which, if undertaken, would be the fourth Israeli invasion of the country in the past 50 years. Hezbollah has vowed that it will “continue its fight to confront the enemy,” while Iran, which backs the group as part of its network of regional proxies, has given an assurance of its solidarity . Here’s what we know so far and where things might go next. Escalating conflict Israel has pounded what it says are Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese capital of Beirut and elsewhere in the country on Friday and Saturday, including the attack on the capital’s southern suburbs that killed Nasrallah. Some of the strikes have come in densely populated areas, flattening residential buildings. Israel has said Hezbollah stores weapons in civilian buildings, which the group denies, and accuses Hezbollah of using residents as “human shields.” Lebanese civilians say they cannot heed warnings from Israel’s military to avoid places where Hezbollah is operating, because the group is highly secretive. The warnings also often come just minutes before a building is struck. Residents from Beirut’s southern suburbs have been fleeing to escape Israeli bombardment, with many seen sleeping in public places with no space left in makeshift shelters.

Carl Court/Getty Images The latest attacks come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States and France that called for a 21-day pause in fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border. The White House has said it had “no knowledge of or participation in” Israel’s Friday attack on Beirut, with US President Joe Biden describing Nasrallah’s death as a “measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, while calling for de-escalation in conflicts across the Middle East. The US sees the possibility of a limited ground incursion into Lebanon as Israel moves forces to its northern border, CNN reported earlier, citing a senior administration official and a US official. But the officials stressed that Israel does not appear to have made a decision on whether to carry out a ground incursion. Earlier Saturday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner said the military was preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion, but it was only one option being considered. What will Hezbollah – or Iran – do? In the wake of Nasrallah’s killing – and the attack on pagers and walkie-talkies – Hezbollah’s remaining leaders are likely to be assessing how to meet, communicate and respond. Some of the factors that will impact that response – such as the extent to which Israeli strikes have reduced the group’s munitions – remain unknown. But analysts say the setbacks faced by the group are unlikely to leave it completely weakened. “Hezbollah has taken the biggest blow to its military infrastructure since its inception,” said Hanin Ghaddar , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and author of “Hezbollahland.” The group, however, still retains skilled commanders, as well as many of its most powerful assets – including precision-guided missiles and long-range missiles that could inflict significant damage to Israel’s military and civilian infrastructure, said Ghaddar. So far, there has not been a major barrage of rockets from Hezbollah that has caused significant, known damage to Israeli targets. And even in the wake of Nasrallah’s killing the group has yet to launch a major retaliation at the level that could see Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system overwhelmed and its power grid affected.

Baz Ratner/AP But the latest development raises the potential for a shift. Hezbollah will almost certainly respond, according to Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region, who told CNN: “The response is likely to be big enough that the odds it will prompt a full-scale war will skyrocket.” Another key question is the extent to which Iran could get involved. The state has appeared wary of moving into direct conflict with Israel, even as their long-standing shadow war has been pushed further into the open in recent months – and observers say direct Iranian retaliation could also draw the US further into the conflict. A senior US official said the US believes Iran will intervene in the conflict if they judge that they are about to “lose” Hezbollah. The combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah had already taken hundreds of fighters off the battlefield, according to that official and another person familiar with the intelligence. Iran’s embassy in Lebanon in a social media post Friday called Nasrallah’s killing a “serious escalation that changes the rules of the game,” and said its perpetrator “will be punished and disciplined appropriately.” The Iranian envoy to the United Nations on Saturday also requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council to “condemn Israel’s actions in the strongest possible terms.” But the space for diplomacy seems limited, especially as months of work on a ceasefire deal for the war in Gaza have seen little lasting progress. Pointing to the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Hezbollah, and Israel and Iran, former US State Department Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN: “None of these wars of attrition are going to end any time soon… there are no transformative, diplomatic Hollywood endings.” “At best, it’s a question of deterrence, management and maybe, if Hezbollah, the Israelis and the Iranians are open to it… agreements that will contain conflict,” he said.

His death marks a major moment in recent Middle East history, but the long-term consequences are uncertain. It raises a key question: Do “decapitation strikes” killing the leaders of terrorist groups cripple them? The short answer is not really. Israel should know from its own history that such strikes don’t always succeed in crippling a militant group. In 2008, Israel killed Hezbollah’s military leader , Imad Mughniyeh, in Damascus, Syria, yet the group only gathered strength in the years that followed. Four years earlier, Israel killed a founder of Hamas , Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in an airstrike. Yet, the group did not collapse, and almost two decades later it still carried out the October 7 attacks in Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis in a single day. More recently, in July, Israel said it killed one of the October 7 masterminds, Mohammed Deif , a key Hamas military commander, yet the militant group fights on in Gaza. The US has its own history of killing terrorist leaders in the hope that it will cripple its foes. When Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a US bombing raid in 2006, it was treated as a major breakthrough because al Qaeda in Iraq was significantly contributing to the civil war that was then tearing the country apart. Yet eight years later, al Qaeda in Iraq eventually morphed into ISIS , which took over territory the size of Portugal and presided over a population of some eight million people in Iraq and Syria. ISIS also carried out devastating terrorist attacks in the West, for instance, in Paris in 2015 that killed 130 people. What actually ended ISIS’s geographical “caliphate” was not a strike on its leadership but a ground campaign against the terrorist army from 2014 to 2019 waged by the Iraqi military and Syrian Kurdish forces backed by thousands of US troops and significant American airpower. ISIS’s base, the second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, was largely destroyed during this war. In May 2016, then-President Barack Obama authorized a drone strike in Pakistan that killed the overall leader of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour. Yet, today, the Taliban control all of Afghanistan. Then-President Donald Trump ordered a strike in Baghdad, Iraq, in early January 2020 that killed Qasem Soleimani , the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Quds Force who was crucial to Iran’s relationships with its proxy forces in the region such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen and Shia militias in Iraq. After Soleimani was killed, Trump said, “Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.” Yet, his death had no lasting impact on Iran’s regional power and ambitions, and Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis in Yemen have continued their attacks on Israeli targets and Shia militias continued their attacks on American targets in Iraq. The United States has designated the Taliban, the Houthis, Hamas, ISIS and Hezbollah as terrorist groups. What can disable a terrorist group? What can cripple a terrorist group is a sustained campaign to take out as many of its leaders and middle managers as possible. A CIA drone campaign that was ramped up in 2008 in Pakistan’s tribal regions bordering Afghanistan killed many of al Qaeda’s leaders, according to New America , a research institution (where I am a vice president). Documents recovered by the US Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011 show that al Qaeda’s leader regularly wrote to his followers living in the country’s tribal regions, urging them to move around only on cloudy days when the drones were less effective. As a result, bin Laden was planning to pull all his followers out of the tribal region and resettle them in other parts of Pakistan. Bin Laden’s death certainly significantly contributed to undercutting al Qaeda’s appeal to terrorists and its abilities to carry out attacks since it was bin Laden who had founded the group, had directed its most lethal operations, and members of the group had sworn a personal oath of allegiance to him. Bin Laden’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, didn’t have the charisma or the organizational skills to resuscitate al Qaeda, and Zawahiri himself was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan two years ago. The UN estimates there are about four hundred members of al Qaeda living in Afghanistan today. While al Qaeda is a relatively small terrorist group, Hezbollah has been in existence for four decades and is backed by Iran, which is a key player in the region and has an army of some 30,000 soldiers armed with an extensive arsenal , including some 150,000 rockets and missiles. The killing of Nasrallah is a key prize for Israel as part of its larger wave of attacks on Hezbollah that intensified earlier this month with its covert action exploding thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies followed by massive airstrikes that have taken out infrastructure and other senior leaders. But it’s too early to write the militant group off, though it’s clearly in disarray. History suggests it will reorganize and appoint other leaders to continue its long fight against Israel."

Nasrallah, who had led the powerful group for more than 30 years and was a hugely influential figure in the region, died when Israeli fighter jets struck in an area of the capital’s southern suburbs known as Dahiyeh. The killing of Nasrallah marks a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which has intensified in recent weeks, prompting fears that it could spill over into a regional war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Nasrallah had been operating from the headquarters and “advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel.” Hezbollah described Nasrallah as a “sacred martyr” and vowed to continue its fight against Israel. He was among several Hezbollah fighters – and a senior Iranian commander – killed in the strike on Friday. “The leadership of Hezbollah pledges to the most supreme, sacred, and dearest martyr in our journey, filled with sacrifices and martyrs, that it will continue its fight to confront the enemy, in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defense of Lebanon and its steadfast and honorable people,” the group said in a statement. The Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar TV channel switched to Quranic recitations – an Islamic gesture declaring mourning. Hamas issued a statement mourning Nasrallah, as did other regional allies . In Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati declared three days of mourning. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared five days of national mourning and warned that Israel faces “crushing blows” to come. The powerful Iraqi cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr also announced three days of mourning in Iraq, referring to Nasrallah as a “companion in the path of resistance.” A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on September 17, killing at least nine people and wounding around 2,800 in blasts the Iran-backed militant group blamed on Israel. AFP/Getty Images Related article Israel concealed explosives inside batteries of pagers sold to Hezbollah, Lebanese officials say Nasrallah turned Hezbollah into the most robustly armed non-state group in the region – commanding a dedicated following across Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. It is the most dominant political force in crisis-ridden Lebanon. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization . Fears of an all-out war peaked earlier this month, after Israel unleashed a wave of lethal explosions of communications devices, targeting Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. Some of those killed were civilian bystanders. Then on Monday , Israel launched an intensive aerial campaign in southern and eastern Lebanon, in what was the deadliest day for the country in nearly two decades . Hezbollah has fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel in response to the attacks. Israeli bombs in Lebanon have since killed at least 700 people, and thousands more have been injured, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday. Nearly 120,000 others have been displaced, according to OCHA, in a country where both Lebanese and refugees from other countries were already facing sharp poverty, economic instability and limited access to healthcare. Estimates in Lebanon suggest that number could be much higher. An Israeli military official said they did not yet know how many civilians were killed in Israel’s strike on southern Beirut that killed Nasrallah. A man rides his motorbike through a neighborhood levelled by Israeli strikes, in the Hadath district, of Beirut's southern suburbs, on Saturday. AFP/Getty Images Questions have swirled over how the Iran-backed group will respond to Israel’s persistent bombing campaign, and now the killing of its leader. Hezbollah’s response has so far been relatively contained. Israeli officials cited two key reasons for this: Nearly all of Hezbollah’s senior commanders have been killed, leaving its command-and-control structure in disarray, and Israeli airstrikes have debilitated much of the operational infrastructure Hezbollah would use to carry out significant retaliation. But one Israeli official acknowledged that Israel knows it has not taken out Hezbollah’s entire capabilities and that its senior commanders are replaceable. How Hezbollah regroups and what direction it receives from Iran also remain to be seen . A senior member of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC), was also killed in the Israeli attack, according to Iranian state media. Abbas Nilforoshan, who served as a military adviser during the Syrian civil war, was likely meeting Nasrallah when Israel struck. The commander was sanctioned by the US treasury for his role in suppressing protests during the 2022 Iranian demonstration after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in custody of Iran’s morality police. Israel expands war on multiple fronts For most of the past year, Israel and Hezbollah have traded skirmishes at the border, following Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks into southern Israel. Hamas killed 1,200 in the attacks and abducted more than 250 others, according to Israeli authorities. Hezbollah says it has been firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, and Palestinians trying to survive Israeli attacks in Gaza , which have killed 41,586 people and injured another 96,210, according to the Ministry of Health there. Around 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah rocket fire that began on October 8. The Lebanese militant group is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the region – spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq – that says it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza rages on.

Western leaders have warned of devastating consequences, as Israel intensifies attacks in the region. Hussein Malla/AP As the Israeli military intensifies its war on multiple fronts in the region, Western allies have warned of catastrophic consequences in Lebanon – which they say could even exceed the irrevocable destruction and human devastation in Gaza. The strike that killed Nasrallah was also a clear signal that Israel was not close to accepting a ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, backed by the US , according to Mick Mulroy, a former top Middle East official at the Defense Department. Hezbollah is also now unlikely to be interested in the negotiations. On Saturday, US President Joe Biden called Nasrallah’s killing a “measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, but called for de-escalation. The US “fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups,” Biden said in a statement. “Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means,” he added. Meanwhile, Israeli forces renewed their attacks in the densely populated Dahiyeh neighborhood into Saturday. Israeli strikes razed buildings to rubble. At least 33 people were killed and 195 others injured in Saturday’s attacks, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Since Monday, Israel’s attacks in Lebanon have left around one million people displaced, according to Nasser Yassin, the minister in charge of Lebanon’s crisis management center. A CNN team on the ground reported large flashes and thuds of impacting Israeli missiles echoed across the capital Saturday. Officials announced that hospitals in Dahiyeh would be evacuated “due to developments in the aggression.” The IDF said it was targeting what it alleges are buildings used by Hezbollah as command centers, weapons productions and storage sites. Hezbollah has denied that its weapons are being stored in civilian buildings targeted by Israeli strikes. The IDF said a senior Hezbollah intelligence leader, Hassan Khalil Yassin, was killed in a Saturday airstrike in the Dahiyeh area. The IDF said Yassin worked with Hezbollah’s offensive units to personally plan terror attacks against Israeli civilians on the northern border and deep within Israeli territory. ‘Biggest crisis of all’ Gunfire erupted in Beirut on Saturday afternoon – a gesture to mark martyrdom, believed by Muslims to be one of the highest honors in Islam. Many Hezbollah supporters were initially skeptical after Israel said it believed Nasrallah had been killed. Moments before Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death, a woman and a man said they expected the group’s leader to “surprise us all with an appearance.” “He’s not in Lebanon. I know in my heart he isn’t,” said one elderly Shia woman in a black chador, smiling. Less than five minutes later, the announcement of his death came. “He was martyred,” she kept repeating. “This is the biggest crisis of all,” she added. A man trying to console her said: “Martyrdom was what he wanted … And it’s what he received.” Another woman broke down crying as she recited verses from the Quran with tears streaming down her face. In the Dahiyeh neighborhood, where Nasrallah was killed, loud chants of: “We submit to you Nasrallah,” and “We will never accept humiliation,” were heard.

His death caps a series of devastating blows for the group, already reeling from the humiliation of having its communications network comprehensively infiltrated, and suggests that one of Israel’s most formidable enemies is deeply wounded. One of the founding members of the group formed four decades ago with the aid of Iran, Nasrallah ascended to the top of Hezbollah in 1992. He replaced his predecessor and mentor, Abbas Musawi, as secretary-general of Hezbollah, after he was killed by an Israeli helicopter strike. Born to a grocer and his wife in Beirut in August 1960, Nasrallah spent his early adolescence under the shadow of Lebanon’s civil war. His family were forced to flee the capital when the fighting erupted in 1975, moving further south to a village near the coastal city of Tyre. One year later, Nasrallah moved to Iraq to attend a Shiite seminary. But he was swiftly expelled during the persecution of Shiite Muslims under Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s repressive regime – returning to Lebanon to study under his teacher, Musawi. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, responding to attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organization, Nasrallah rallied a group of fighters to resist the occupation – which would evolve into Hezbollah. Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory that year , and were held responsible for the killing of at least 17,000 people, according to reports and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at a Beirut refugee camp. Nasrallah, pictured on March 11, 1999, addresses guerrillas battling Israeli forces in Lebanon's occupied south. Hezbollah was formed more than a decade earlier, by Lebanese fighters resisting Israel's invasion. Ho New/Reuters Transformation of Hezbollah Known for his fiery speeches, the leader oversaw the transformation of Hezbollah, from a rag-tag group of militants in the 1980s to an organization that mounted a concerted campaign to drive out Israeli occupation in 2000. The Lebanese militant group became a regional fighting force under Nasrallah. He led the growth of Hezbollah’s forces – his fighters and reservists are thought to number 100,000 – as well as the proliferation of its arsenal, which boasts long-range as well as medium and short-range missiles and drones. Nasrallah commands a dedicated following of hundreds of thousands of largely Shiite Muslims – in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. His influence in the Iran-backed so-called axis of resistance grew exponentially after the US assassinated Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani, the architect of the region-wide axis, in 2020 . Hezbollah is the most robustly armed non-state group in the region – and is the most dominant political force in crisis-ridden Lebanon. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization . People sit in a cafe in Beirut to watch a speech by Nasrallah, on September 19.

Fears of an all-out war peaked earlier this month, after Israel unleashed a wave of lethal explosions across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah fighters. Many of those killed were civilian bystanders . In the days since, hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon have been forced from their homes by Israeli attacks . In total, since October 7, more than 1,500 civilians in Lebanon have been killed and over 200,000 people displaced, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Lebanese officials estimate the true number of displaced is closer to half a million. Human rights advocates have fiercely condemned the violence – including UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who warned that Lebanon is suffering its bloodiest period “in a generation” and called on Israel and Hezbollah to “stop the killing and destruction.”"

As Iran watches its most prized non-state ally take a beating, questions are raised about how it might respond.","Sep 28, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Abbas Al Lawati,Middle East,"CNN — Israel’s audacious assassination of Hezbollah’s leader on Friday has rattled the group, delivering its most severe blow since its founding. This has led its Iranian backers to warn that Israel has entered a dangerous phase of the conflict by altering the rules of engagement. As Tehran watches its most prized non-state ally take a beating, questions are mounting about how it may respond. The Jewish state significantly escalated its yearlong conflict with the group after expanding its Gaza war objectives on September 17 to include its northern front with Hezbollah. The following day, thousands of pagers used by its members exploded simultaneously, with walkie-talkies targeted the day after that. Israel then began an air assault that killed several Hezbollah commanders and led to the highest number of casualties in Lebanon in almost two decades. And on Friday, Israel struck what it said was Hezbollah’s headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut, killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah. How much has Hezbollah been degraded? The Israeli military has claimed that the group’s chain of command “has been almost completely dismantled ” after it killed a series of what it says are top officials in the organization this week. “Hezbollah has taken the biggest blow to its military infrastructure since its inception. In addition to losing weapon depots and facilities, the group has lost most of its senior commanders, and its communications network is broken,” said Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and author of “Hezbollahland.” Rescuers sift through the rubble at the scene of an Israeli strike that targeted Beirut's southern suburbs a day earlier, as search and rescue operations continue on September 21. AFP/Getty Images Despite its losses however, the group still retains skilled commanders and many of its most powerful assets , including precision-guided missiles and long-range missiles that could inflict significant damage to Israel’s military and civilian infrastructure, said Ghaddar. Most of those missiles haven’t been deployed yet. Since Israel stepped up its campaign, Hezbollah’s military performance “has proven that it was able to absorb that shock and was able to bounce back and it has been striking hard at northern Israel for days now,” said Amal Saad, Hezbollah expert and lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University in Wales. On Wednesday, Israel intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Hezbollah near Tel Aviv, an unprecedented attack that reached deep into the country’s commercial heartland. Hezbollah said it targeted the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence agency. CNN Related article Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide While Nasrallah’s killing is unlikely to disrupt the operational continuity of the movement it is “obviously a massive, massive demoralization amongst its ranks and supporters and absolute terror which will temporarily paralyze ordinary people” within the movement, said Saad. “That doesn’t mean the organization is paralyzed,” she added. “Hezbollah is an organization that was built to absorb these types of shocks… it’s built to be resilient and outlast individual leaders.” Few contenders for Hezbollah’s leadership can match Nasrallah’s popularity, said Ghaddar, as he is closely associated with the group’s “golden days,” including the end of Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 and the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, both of which were viewed as major victories for the Lebanese group. If the group’s leadership is truly dismantled and coordination between Iran and Hezbollah is disrupted, it could prompt Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to take the lead, according to Ghaddar. “They (Iran) will have to find a way to do it themselves. But it’s not an easy option as they will (become) targets, and they don’t understand Lebanon.” Under what circumstances would Iran intervene? Ahead of the attempt on Nasrallah’s life, Iran’s official line was that Hezbollah is capable of defending itself, even as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged on Wednesday that Israel’s killing of the group’s leaders was “ definitely a loss. ” Following Friday’s airstrike however, Iran’s embassy in Lebanon indicated that Tehran’s calculations might now be shifting. “There is no doubt that this reprehensible crime and reckless behavior represent a serious escalation that changes the rules of the game, and that its perpetrator will be punished and disciplined appropriately,” the embassy said on X. Iran’s rationale for avoiding involvement in the conflict may no longer hold, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Washington DC-based Quincy Institute. “If it becomes clear (to Iran) that Hezbollah actually cannot defend itself following the bombing in Beirut, particularly if Nasrallah himself was killed, then the Iranian justification for staying out of the war has collapsed,” he said. “At that point, Iran’s credibility with the rest of its partners in the Axis (of regional militant groups) will risk collapsing if Tehran does not react.” Ambulances arrive at American University of Beirut Medical Center as almost 3,000 people, including Hezbollah fighters and medics, are injured by exploding pagers, in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 17. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Iran is likely “horrified by the effectiveness and efficiency” of Israel’s attacks but despite the targeting of Hezbollah’s top leadership, Tehran may still believe the group can defend itself and dictate the terms of an eventual ceasefire, which would help the group recover, according to  Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute. Tehran is most probably already helping Hezbollah rebuild its military command structure and providing tactical and operational advice to its leadership, he said. However, if the group nears collapse, it could “prompt a more assertive Iranian intervention,” potentially in the form of missile and drone strikes, as seen in April when Iran blamed Israel for attacking its diplomatic building in Damascus. Nadimi added that while a larger attack is unlikely, it’s not entirely out of the question. Saad, the Hezbollah expert from Cardiff University, said an intervention by Iran would likely drag the United States into the war, noting that Tehran was “the weakest link” in the conflict. “It’s the only member of the Axis that is an actual state. All the others are non-state or quasi-state actors. So, Iran has the most to lose if it participates,” she said. “(Iran) is a conventional armed force, it would probably not fare anywhere near as well as Hezbollah would in a war because it’s a completely different military infrastructure,” Saad noted. “Hezbollah knows its terrain and adversary better than anyone else.” Why Hezbollah matters to Iran Since its inception 40 years ago, the Lebanese militant group has been the crown jewel of Tehran’s so-called Axis of Resistance , a group of mostly Shiite, Iran-allied Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen that gives Iran strategic depth against its adversaries. As a non-Arab, Shiite state, Iran sees itself as “strategically lonely” in the Middle East and therefore sees Shiites in the Sunni-dominated region “as the closest thing it has to natural allies,” Parsi said..

Can Israel afford another all-out war? “From Tehran’s perspective, Hezbollah is central to the Axis because of its capabilities and discipline, its geographical placement, and its ideological and political proximity to Iran’s Islamic Republic,” Parsi added. “The destruction of Hezbollah is not in the cards in my assessment, but if it were to occur, that would be an existential blow to the Axis.” The group is essential to “maintain a strong military component on the northern borders of Israel and keep Israel off-balance,” said Nadimi from the Washington Institute. “It will be important to maintain Hezbollah as a viable and resilient actor and ally,” he said. “Iran has designed Hezbollah with resiliency in mind and believes they can take a lot more beating before Iran feels compelled to intervene directly.” Iran looks to improve ties with the West But Iran also has domestic considerations. The escalation between Hezbollah and Israel comes at a delicate time for Iran’s new reformist president, who campaigned on improving foreign relations to lift Tehran out of the isolation that has crippled its economy. Just this week, President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the United Nations that his country is ready to engage with the West on its disputed nuclear program. He has named as his Vice President Javad Zarif, the seasoned, US-educated diplomat who became the face of Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, abandoned by the administration of former US President Donald Trump in 2018. Parsi, from the Quincy Institute, said the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 and the subsequent escalation with Hezbollah “were very badly timed” for Tehran, since they “risked prematurely bringing forward a confrontation between Iran, Hezbollah and Israel at a time that is much more strategically suitable for Israel than the Axis.” Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian addresses the 79th United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York on September 24, 2024. Mike Segar/Reuters At home, Pezeshkian must navigate between his reformist constituency, which favors detente with the West, and hardline elements within the regime that want a show of force against Israel. On Monday, the day nearly 500 Lebanese were killed in Israeli airstrikes, Pezeshkian stated in New York that Iran was ready to “lay down arms if Israel does the same.” The remark sparked intense backlash from hardliners at home for appearing weak in front of the enemy, according to reports . His statement, along with his offer to reconcile with the West in his speech to the UN General Assembly the following day, also drew criticism in some Lebanese media. Given the “profound unhappiness of much of the Iranian public” with the regime, Pezeshkian’s priority is national reconciliation, said Parsi. Still, if Hezbollah is seriously degraded, “Tehran may face a situation in which it will conclude that war is at its doorstep whether it chooses it or not and that it is, as a result, better off responding before Hezbollah is further weakened,” he said. Wary of Israel’s ‘trap’ Asked this week by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour if Iran would consider intervening in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Vice President Zarif said Tehran was wary of falling into “Israel’s trap,” which he said was aimed at expanding the hostilities by dragging other parties into it, including the US. He said that both Iran and Hezbollah had exercised restraint in the face of Israeli attacks, “but now the Israelis are crossing the line, in my view, and there is every prospect of the war getting more difficult to contain.” Hezbollah was capable of defending itself, he added, but it was incumbent on the international community to step in before the situation gets “out of hand.” Iran has yet to carry out the revenge it promised Israel after the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. This week however, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that his country would not remain “indifferent” if a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in Lebanon. “We stand with the people of Lebanon with all means,” he said at a news conference in New York ahead of a UN Security Council meeting."

And again, we anticipate that we’d see a number of people displaced, casualties that, you know, equal or exceed what we’ve seen in Gaza,” Austin told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. The defense secretary, reiterating the US desire for a “diplomatic solution,” also said a possible ground incursion by Israeli forces into Lebanon risks spiraling the situation into a regional conflict. The US and several prominent allies believed they had achieved a 21-day pause in fighting that would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said reports of an imminent deal were “incorrect” and vowed to continue to hit the Iran-backed militant group “with all our might.” Netanyahu spoke at the United Nations General Assembly Friday morning, where he vowed to continue Israel’s military efforts and warned that “there is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach.” US-led efforts to secure a ceasefire appear to have failed, and CNN has reported that the Biden administration has all but paused a push for a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Asked by Blitzer if continued US aid to Israel undermines Washington’s efforts to secure a ceasefire in Lebanon, Austin on Friday reiterated the long-standing alliance. “We’ve been clear from the very beginning that that we’re going to support Israel in its efforts to defend itself,” Austin said. “We’ve done that from the very beginning, and we’re going to continue to do that going forward.” Recent hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began after Israel decided to make returning displaced residents to their homes near the northern border an official goal of its war aims. Tens of thousands of Israelis who live in the area were evacuated shortly after the October 2023 Hamas terrorist attack, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into the region. In recent days, Israel has launched a series of strikes that have targeted Hezbollah’s leadership, and Israel’s military chief said earlier this week that the nation was preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon. Austin also was asked by Blitzer about US support for Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelensky, met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday and is meeting with former President Donald Trump on Friday. Amid ongoing debates in Washington about continued aid to the eastern European nation — especially if Trump, who has been skeptical about such support, is elected — the US is under pressure to allow Ukraine to fire long-range weapons deep into Russia. Austin said US policy about the use and range of certain weapons has not changed but said the US can’t dictate how Ukraine should use “their” weapons. “What we’ve seen recently is that Ukraine has the ability to now produce its own weaponry in terms of (unmanned aerial vehicles) that are proving to be very, very effective in that fight,” Austin said. “And some of these UAVs can range out beyond 400 kilometers, which is beyond the range of (US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems) or Storm Shadow or anything else that we would be able to provide them.” He also declined to answer a question from Blitzer about whether US policy toward Ukraine has been “irreversibly politicized” in the wake of Republican reluctance to continue arming the US ally. “Our focus will remain on making sure that we’re giving Ukraine everything that we can provide, that will prove effective in this fight,” he said.

Lebanese security officials watched a series of controlled explosions of some of the weaponized pagers , as investigations into who manufactured the wireless communication devices and how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets continued. The pagers used in the controlled explosions were switched off at the time of the attack on September 17, which meant they did not receive the message that caused the compromised devices to detonate. The officials had a front-row seat to see just how catastrophic the blasts would have been to those carrying the devices and others around them. Thousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members last week, targeting their pagers on Tuesday, and then walkie-talkies a day later. In all, the blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders. The attack blindsided the group , which had opted for analogue technologies after forgoing cell phones to avoid Israeli infiltration. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. AFP/Getty Images Israel has not commented directly on the attacks, but CNN has learned that the explosions were the result of a joint operation by Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, tacitly acknowledged his country’s role the day after the pager attack, praising “excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad.” Both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks. One of the Lebanese security sources told CNN the way in which the explosive material had been hidden inside the pagers’ batteries was so sophisticated that it could not be detected, but did not elaborate further as to what sort of checks the devices had gone through before entering the country. The second high-ranking security source said that he had examined one of the compromised pagers and witnessed its controlled explosion. He told CNN that the explosive material was “laced” inside the pager’s lithium battery and virtually undetectable. He added that he had never seen anything like it. An improvised explosive device has five key components: A power source, an initiator, a detonator, an explosive charge and a case to put it all in. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said that only a detonator and explosive charge would have been needed to weaponize the pagers, which already have the other three components. “It had to be done in such a way to make it invisible,” Moorhouse said, adding that one way to do that could have been modifying the battery itself – implanting an electronic detonator and small explosive charge inside of its metal casing, which would have made it impossible to detect with imaging, for example X-rays. People gather outside American University of Beirut Medical Center on September 17, 2024, as people wounded in the pager attack pour in for treatment. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Other experts who reviewed footage of the blasts also said that explosive devices appeared to have been hidden in the pagers, suggesting a sophisticated supply chain attack involving a state actor. That tallied with initial assessments by Lebanese authorities. Lebanon’s mission to the United Nations said in a letter sent to the UN Security Council last Friday that a preliminary investigation found that the communications devices were implanted with explosives before arriving in the country, tampered with “in a professional way” by “foreign entities.” Lebanese authorities determined that the devices were detonated by sending electronic messages to them, according to the letter, which was seen by CNN. Israel was responsible for carrying out the attacks, which detonated thousands of devices simultaneously, Lebanon’s UN mission said. Mysterious supply chain stretches from Taiwan to Hungary Multiple photos from the aftermath of last week’s attacks in Lebanon show remnants of the exploded pagers – also known as beepers – that were consistent with a model made by a Taiwanese firm, Gold Apollo , and fragments of walkie-talkies identified as the make of a Japanese firm, ICOM. Lebanese authorities have said that the devices used in the attacks were Gold Apollo Rugged Pager AR-924 pagers and ICOM IC-V82 walkie-talkies. Both Gold Apollo and ICOM have distanced themselves from the compromised devices. ICOM said that the IC-V82 model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether the devices targeted in Lebanon were counterfeit or shipped from its company. Counterfeit versions are widely available for purchase on e-commerce websites, like Alibaba. Lebanon’s communications ministry said the IC-V82 radios used in the attacks were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services. International investigative efforts have largely zeroed in on the Gold Apollo AR-924 pagers – tracing the model’s licensing and manufacturing from Taiwan to apparent shell companies to try to establish how the Israeli operation may have been carried out. The New York Times reported , citing three intelligence officers briefed on the operation, that Israel had set up at least three shell companies to disguise the identities of those making the pagers – Israeli intelligence officers. The chairman and founder of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, Hsu Ching-kuang, was questioned by Taiwanese prosecutors last Thursday before being released.

Yan Zhao/AFP/Getty Images A day earlier, at the nondescript offices of Gold Apollo on the outskirts of the Taiwanese capital, Hsu, speaking to CNN and other media, vehemently denied having made the pagers bearing his company’s brand name, claiming instead that they were manufactured by a Hungarian firm, BAC Consulting. Hsu told CNN he had entered into a licensing agreement with the Budapest-registered company, signing over “sole responsibility” for the production and sale of the AR-924 model. A person called Teresa was one of his contacts for the deal, he said. Teresa Wu, a former Gold Apollo employee, was also seen leaving the prosecutors’ office in New Taipei City last Thursday evening, according to reporting by Reuters and local media staked out outside. Prosecutors in Taiwan currently list Hsu and Wu as witnesses, two senior officials in Taiwan told CNN. A person with knowledge of Gold Apollo told CNN that Wu had left the company a couple of years ago, and that they understood she had started working for BAC Consulting. CNN has reached out to Wu for comment. The logo of Taiwanese company Gold Apollo is seen outside its office in New Taipei City on September 18, 2024. Yan Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Related article Who made Hezbollah’s exploding devices? Questions swirl around a mysterious supply chain stretching from Taiwan to Hungary Wu set up a company called Apollo Systems Ltd in April of this year, listed under a Taipei address that appears to be a co-working space, according to corporate records. It is not clear if Wu was operating for BAC Consulting in Taipei under her new company name, Apollo Systems Ltd. Apollo Systems Ltd lists its website address as “www.apollosystemshk.com,” according to a database maintained by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. The Apollo Systems HK website – which was shut down by its administrator after the attack – said that the business had a manufacturing and sales hub in Taipei City and a logistics office in Hong Kong. When CNN visited the Hong Kong address, there was no sign of the company. In December 2022 and February 2023, a YouTube channel for Apollo Systems HK uploaded two videos of the Gold Apollo AR-924 pager touting its “high-capacity lithium rechargeable battery” and other features. On its YouTube channel and website, Apollo Systems HK said that it had acquired the “sole distribution rights” to Gold Apollo pager systems. It also listed the AR-924 model as a product available for purchase. The two senior Taiwanese officials who spoke with CNN said that there was no record of Gold Apollo manufacturing any AR-924 pagers in Taiwan. The officials also confirmed that Gold Apollo only manufactured pagers with AA batteries in Taiwan, not lithium batteries as found in the devices used in the attack and examined by Lebanese officials, according to CNN’s sources. Customs records in Taiwan, cited by the officials, showed that Gold Apollo shipped more than 20,000 pagers from Taiwan to the United States in the first eight months of 2024. More than 5,000 pagers were shipped to Hong Kong, while more than 3,000 pagers were shipped to Australia. The Taiwanese officials said they had also checked the order history and the source of raw components for Gold Apollo pagers, adding that pager manufacturing was tightly controlled in Taiwan and that devices undergo regular inspections. The Taiwanese prosecutors’ office is reviewing documents it obtained from Gold Apollo’s office. In a statement last Thursday, the prosecutors’ office said that there had “been no evidence found so far to suggest any involvements (sic) of Taiwanese nationals in the explosive terror attack.” Investigations into the supply chain are also ongoing in Europe, where authorities are probing the Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, and another firm linked to Bulgaria and Norway, for any connections to the pager attack targeting Hezbollah. CNN has attempted to reach BAC Consulting at its registered address, which is located in a residential area of Budapest. Last Wednesday, a receptionist working at the building said that BAC Consulting rented a space at the address but that no representative had ever physically been there. CNN has also reached out to BAC Consulting’s chief executive, Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, but has yet to receive a response. NBC News reported that Bársony-Arcidiacono had confirmed to the news outlet in a phone call that her company worked with Gold Apollo, but said, “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate.” Reporters gathered outside the registered address for BAC Consulting in Budapest, Hungary, on September 18, 2024. Jakub Porzycki/Anadolu/Getty Images/File There is no record of Gold Apollo exporting any pagers to Hungary in 2023 or 2024, the two Taiwanese officials said, citing custom records in Taiwan. In 2022, the company exported about 200 pagers to Hungary, they added. Hungarian intelligence services have interviewed Bársony-Arcidiacono several times as part of their investigation into BAC Consulting but have not found any evidence that the pagers used in the attack were manufactured in the country, the government’s press office said in a statement. “The results have clearly established that the so-called ‘beepers’ were never present on Hungarian soil, and no Hungarian company or expert was involved in their production or modification,” it said. Bulgarian authorities said they were investigating Norta Global Ltd after Hungarian media reported last week that the Sofia-based company was involved in the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah. Bulgaria’s national security agency DANS said that no pagers used in the attack were “imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria,” and that Norta Global Ltd had not carried out terrorist financing, or traded with anyone subject to sanctions. Bulgaria’s caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev told reporters last Friday that the company under investigation was “a cash flow, mailbox-type of firm,” and that its director “acted by proxy.” According to a report by Dezső András, a journalist with Hungarian news outlet Telex , Norta Global Ltd transferred more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) to BAC Consulting in several instalments between March 2023 and June 2024, money that was later sent by BAC in various payments to Gold Apollo, Apollo Systems Ltd and an unnamed Hong Kong firm. The report added that customs data from October 2022 showed that Apollo Systems Ltd. had sent one shipment to Hungary: A package containing just one pager. Norta Global Ltd was founded in April 2022 by Rinson Jose, a Norwegian national, according to Bulgarian business registration documents. CNN has tried to contact Jose on multiple platforms for comment, but he has not yet responded. Norway’s security police have started a preliminary probe into the company’s reported links to the pagers, according to a police attorney at the Norwegian Police Security Service. Hezbollah digs into devices’ supply chain Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, in an address last Thursday, said that the militant group had formed multiple internal investigative committees to get to the bottom of what happened, vowing a “reckoning” for those responsible. “Regarding the explosions, we have reached an almost certain conclusion, but we still need some time to confirm it,” Nasrallah said. “This entire matter is under thorough investigation and review, from the company that sold the devices, to manufacturing, transportation, arrival in Lebanon, and distribution, all the way to the moment of the explosion.” He added that while the apparent goal of the attack was to kill as many senior Hezbollah officials as possible, much of the leadership had been unaffected because they were carrying older pager models, suggesting that the form of communication has been used by the group for some time. “The new ones were sent elsewhere,” he said, apparently referring to the batch of pagers a Lebanese security source told CNN was purchased by Hezbollah in recent months. People watch a speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as they sit in a cafe in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, on September 19, 2024. Hassan Ammar/AP “These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons, simultaneously exploding across marketplaces, on street corners, and in homes as daily life unfolds,” UN human rights chief Volker Türk told the Security Council last Friday. “Authorities have reportedly dismantled unexploded devices in universities, banks, and hospitals.” He added that simultaneously targeting thousands of people – whether civilians or armed forces – without the knowledge of who is in possession of the targeted devices and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law. Iran’s delegate to the UN said that Israel had intended to kill at least 5,000 civilians, but some devices were deactivated or not distributed. The delegate said that Israel had again “crossed a red line,” noting that Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured. Senior UN officials warned that the devices attack marked a turning point, calling for de-escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza before a war consumes the whole of the Middle East. Others said that the technology apparently used marked “dangerous new territory” in the world of warfare.

In a hastily arranged call with reporters just moments after the release of a joint statement, top administration officials hailed the framework as “an important breakthrough.” The 21-day pause in fighting that the nations were proposing would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah. Those officials were clear: The question was not if Israel and Hezbollah would accept the ceasefire proposal, but precisely when. Both Israel and Hezbollah were “familiar with the text,” one official said, and the US felt comfortable going public with the framework, with the understanding that both sides were ready to sign on.

First, the prime minister’s office released a statement saying any reports of an imminent ceasefire was “incorrect” and that the IDF would continue fighting with “full force.” Then, the prime minister himself told the press as he got off his plane in New York City: “My policy, our policy, is clear: We continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might. We will not stop until we achieve all our goals.” Some 24 hours after the White House’s announcement of the ceasefire proposal, there has still been no indication that Israel and Hezbollah are ready to agree to it. Israel’s initial response was clearly not the reaction the White House had anticipated, and it raised immediate question of why, if Israel was on board with the proposal, its leader appeared so eager to dismiss it. “We are shocked,” said one US official, underscoring deep frustration after they had hoped Israel would accept the proposal. “Not a complete surprise, but also not helpful,” a second US official said. There were quiet rumblings in Washington that domestic politics could be at play for Netanyahu, as right-wing Israeli ministers – whom Netanyahu had depended upon to maintain his governing coalition – expressed indignation at reports of a US-backed ceasefire. One US source who suggested that the Israeli government was being swayed by the negative reaction to the proposal at home expressed frustration, saying the US would not have come out with such optimism had there not been strong private indications that the Israelis were prepared to accept the framework. The source said they did not expect negotiations to wrap up in the coming days, saying they expected the process to be long. And as long as Israel does not publicly accept it, they added, Hezbollah won’t feel pressure to either. American officials’ confidence in announcing the proposal on Wednesday had been derived, in part, because they were dealing with Ron Dermer, one of Netanyahu’s closest confidants, as they wrote and revised the statement’s text. Discussions on the ceasefire began with a conversation Monday between Dermer and Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. The impression the US officials received was that Netanyahu would support a pause in fighting, and they were encouraged to work with French officials to complete a statement that urged a 21-day ceasefire. Speaking Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be a “mistake” for Netanyahu to reject the ceasefire, but added the United States would need to increase pressure on Israel to accept its terms. Netanyahu’s apparent reversal amounted to a major disappointment, but for some officials it also underscored a reality that has existed for months: Netanyahu’s willingness to break publicly and openly with Biden, particularly when he faces internal political opposition in Israel.

Asked about the apparent disconnect between the US and Israel, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the multi-nation statement was “indeed coordinated with the Israeli side.” Discussions between the negotiations parties in New York are “ongoing,” she continued, but failed to explain why Netanyahu and his office appeared wholly uninterested in agreeing to the temporary ceasefire. White House spokesman John Kirby was even more blunt in acknowledging that he had no good explanation for Netanyahu’s comments. “I can’t speak for Prime Minister Netanyahu, I can’t answer the question why he said what he said,” he told reporters. “What I can tell you is that statement we worked on last night wasn’t just drawn up in a vacuum,” Kirby added. “It was done after careful consultation, not only with the countries that signed on to it, but Israel itself.” Kirby even acknowledged that the plan would not have been released Wednesday night had the US not believed Netanyahu and his government was on board. For now, administration officials continue to insist that discussions are ongoing and expressed hope that news could come within hours. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top Israeli officials in New York Thursday afternoon, even as many US officials were open to the possibility that Netanyahu may not get on board. Dermer and Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog demurred when asked by CNN ahead of that meeting if they are going to accept the ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah. Dermer quipped that “less is more” when speaking as a diplomat, and pointed out that their day of meetings was only just getting started. This story has been updated with additional details."

The proposal, described by one senior US official as an “important breakthrough,” comes amid deadly fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that many fear could spill into a wider conflict. Hoping to prevent such an outcome, diplomats and leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly spent the last 48 hours hurriedly working to secure a plan that would pause the fighting and allow room for diplomacy to take hold. Israel and Hezbollah have yet to agree. But US officials said both parties were “familiar” with the contours of the proposal and voiced optimism the moment was right for it to be revealed publicly. “The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,” read a joint statement from the nations released late Wednesday. President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. “We were able to generate significant support from Europe, as well as the Arab nations,” Biden told reporters late Wednesday. “It’s important this war not widen.” The immediate objective of the agreement is to lower temperatures and allow residents along the border to return to their homes in Israel and Lebanon. But officials also hope the ceasefire being proposed could “open up diplomatic space” and “galvanize” a stalled ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas to halt the fighting and free the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, senior administration officials asserted in the moments after the framework was announced. Plan is the result of ‘an all-out effort’ The plan was announced after what one Biden administration official called “an all-out effort by the administration” to secure a cessation in hostilities as the conflict threatens to widen into a larger regional war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent the past few days shuttling back and forth between Arab and European partners working on the details of a proposal to stop the fighting between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah. Biden has been discussing the escalating hostilities in the Middle East with various world leaders this week on the sidelines of the General Assembly. On Wednesday, he discussed the matter with Macron, the White House said, helping to finalize the plan. Blinken led intensive behind-the-scenes diplomacy on the sidelines of the UN gathering to help broker the ceasefire proposal, a US official said. On Monday, he soft-launched the idea to his G7 counterparts, though didn’t share specific details. The ceasefire proposal was negotiated with both sides before it was rolled out publicly, according to a senior administration official. On Wednesday, Blinken and White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, one of the mediators conveying details to Hezbollah. The US had been conveying messages to Hezbollah through mediators for several days. On the margins of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting on Wednesday morning, Blinken separately pulled aside both Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask for the countries’ support for the proposal, which they both gave. Blinken dispatched his deputy chief of staff, Tom Sullivan, on Wednesday morning to meet with the political directors of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to get their support for the framework. US officials were optimistic Wednesday night that both sides will accept the deal, but some diplomats told CNN that they are concerned about both sides respecting their commitment to the ceasefire. Hope to kickstart Gaza talks After months of painstaking and so far unsuccessful negotiations to end the war in Gaza and free remaining hostages, officials said they believed this latest proposal could shake loose the moribund talks . “It buys some time and space to try to pursue an arrangement in Gaza…and the hostage deal we’ve been discussing,” one of the officials said. “And if (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar understands there is not going to be a broader regional conflict, there really is a choice here. You do the deal, release the hostages, you get an awful lot of calm in Gaza.” Earlier Wednesday night, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the United Nations Security Council that France has been working with the US to secure a 21-day ceasefire to allow negotiations and that details would be made public soon. “A diplomatic solution is indeed possible,” he said, adding that he would travel to Beirut at the end of the week to work with local stakeholders. A source said that the effort to mediate a ceasefire began in earnest for the Biden administration after Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke on the phone with top Israeli official Ron Dermer on Monday. The efforts come as Israel’s top general said Wednesday that the Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given the green light for his government to engage with the US efforts, an Israeli official told CNN. The official said that Netanyahu gave his approval with the understanding that any agreement would have to allow for the return of Israeli civilians to their homes in northern Israel. Hezbollah has long said they would only stop their rocket fire when there was quiet in Gaza, while Israel has tried to treat the two fronts as separate conflicts. The White House has also consistently argued that a ceasefire in Gaza would unlock much more, including a diplomatic deal with Hezbollah that would allow Lebanese and Israeli civilians to return home. Given the fear of escalation, American and other international officials are pushing for a deal first to end the skyrocketing Lebanon fighting so that they can then turn back to the Gaza ceasefire efforts that have been stuck. Biden and his top national security officials have regularly expressed optimism and hope that deals for both were close at hand, only to see them fall apart. Recently, US officials have said they don’t know whether Netanyahu or Sinwar have the political willingness to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking on ABC’s daytime talk show “The View,” Biden alluded to ongoing talks to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon that would unlock further peace discussions elsewhere in the region. “There’s a way to do it, and they have a possibility – I don’t want to exaggerate it, but a possibility — if we can deal with a ceasefire in Lebanon, that it can move into dealing with the West Bank, but we also have Gaza to deal with,” he said. “But it’s possible,” he said, “and I’m using every bit of energy I have with my team … to get this done. There’s a desire to see change in the region.” CNN’s Donald Judd contributed to this report. This story has been updated with additional developments."

The comments come after Israel ramped up its airstrikes in Lebanon and shot down a missile that Hezbollah said it had aimed at the headquarters of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, near Tel Aviv – the first time the Iran-backed militant group has tried to strike so deeply into Israeli territory.

Hassan Jarrah/AFP/Getty Images Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was calling up two reserve brigades because of the conflict with Hezbollah. Israel’s top general in the north, Ori Gordin, had also warned the military “must be fully prepared for maneuvers.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country “will not rest” until the northern residents can return home. “I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing: we are determined to return our residents in the north safely to their homes,” the prime minister said, amid Israel’s intense wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. “We are inflicting blows on Hezbollah that [they] did not imagine. We do it with power, we do it with guile. I promise you one thing - we will not rest until they come home,” he added. Israel has drastically stepped up its strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon this month, as it begins to pivot away from its nearly year-long war against Hamas in Gaza. Last week, Israel made returning residents to their homes in the north an explicit war aim. The next day, hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah militants exploded across Lebanon. The day after, Hezbollah walkie-talkies also exploded. The twin attacks killed dozens and injured thousands. Israel did not say it was behind the attacks, but did claim responsibility for an airstrike on southern Beirut the next day, which killed the leader of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, Ibrahim Aqil. This week, another airstrike on Beirut killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, a senior official who commanded Hezbollah’s missile units. Reeling from the biggest-ever hits to its military structure, Hezbollah began to respond, firing hundreds of missiles into Israel over the past week, but Israel’s unrelenting escalations appear to have put the group on the back foot. “You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are,” Halevi told troops Wednesday. “You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.”"

Its strike Wednesday that was intercepted near Tel Aviv managed to be both unprecedented and understated. It marked many firsts: The first time Hezbollah launched what it said was a ballistic missile at Israel; the first time a missile had reached near Tel Aviv from Lebanon; and the first time Hassan Nasrallah, the militant group’s leader, made good on his promise to respond to Israeli strikes on Beirut with Hezbollah’s own on Tel Aviv. But given the strength of Israel’s air defenses, a single missile – even a ballistic one – was always likely to have been shot down. Why, then, launch just one? As the risk of all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah – and their respective American and Iranian backers – grows each day, the lone shot on Tel Aviv could be taken as both a threat and a cease-and-desist. We have powerful weapons at our disposal, and a powerful friend at our beck and call – don’t try us, Hezbollah seemed to say. The militant group’s gloves are far from fully off – the group has a range of medium and long-range missiles in its arsenal –  but Wednesday’s strike appeared to be a signal to indicate how powerful a punch it could pack. This strike is the latest notch in Hezbollah’s managed escalation as it seeks to respond to an intensive Israeli campaign to force the armed group to cease its daily fire at Israel’s northern-most territory. Smoke rises from Israeli airstrikes in the village of Kfar Rouman, southern Lebanon, on Wednesday. Hussein Malla/AP It is worth remembering how we got here. Hezbollah joined the fight against Israel out of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks against Israel. So far, it has avoided a full-scale war with Israel. Until last week, it had largely limited its involvement to near-daily cross-border strikes that the Israeli military has returned. The strikes forced more than 60,000 Israelis to flee their homes in the north of the country, but the number of casualties remained relatively low. The Lebanese side of the border was also emptied of its nearly 100,000 residents in Israeli strikes as part of the cross-fire. But things began to spiral after a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan heights killed 12 Druze children. Israel accused Hezbollah of firing the rocket, which came from the direction of Lebanon, but Hezbollah has “firmly” denied it was behind the strike. For Israeli officials, though, the situation had become untenable. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began to pivot from fighting Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, backed by bellicose allies on his extreme right. For almost a year, Israel had waged its war in Gaza with the twin aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages it had taken. On September 16, Israel added a new objective: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to their homes. The next day, hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah militants exploded across Lebanon. The day after, Hezbollah walkie-talkies also exploded. The twin attacks killed dozens and injured thousands, delivering a humiliating blow to the group. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but CNN has learned the explosions were the result of a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s attacks did not relent. The next day, it launched an airstrike on a multi-story building in a Beirut suburb where a group of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force had met, killing its leader Ibrahim Aqil other high-level figures. This week, another airstrike killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, another senior official who commanded Hezbollah’s missile units. People displaced from their homes seek shelter in the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon, on Wednesday. Fathi Al-Masri/AFP/Getty Images Reeling from the biggest-ever hits to its military structure, Hezbollah has also discreetly expanded its war aims. It said it launched the ballistic missile Wednesday in support of Palestinians in Gaza and, crucially, in “defense of Lebanon and its people” – an explicit recognition that it is now engaged in a conflict to protect its own territory. While both sides have refrained from declaring that they are at war with each other, their ramped-up goals may make that moot. Hezbollah insists there will be no ceasefire in Lebanon until there is one in Gaza. Netanyahu’s government not only insists there will not be a ceasefire in Gaza – its pivot to Lebanon makes the possibility of a deal even more remote. Where do both sides go from here? Neither has much space to back down. As international calls to defuse the tensions grow, many Lebanese residents are not waiting to find out whether they will be successful. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said Israel’s offensive has displaced up to half a million people. Beirut’s streets are emptying, as foreign embassies urge their citizens to flee the country and many Lebanese move even further north. After years of crises, the growing military conflict is inflicting further despair on Lebanon’s increasingly exhausted population. The fact that neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese authorities have called this a war is little consolation for those in throes of bombardment and mass displacement."

People in Tel Aviv and the central city of Netanya woke up to sirens on Wednesday as Israel said its air defenses intercepted a surface-to-surface missile – the first time ever a missile fired by Hezbollah has reached close to the city, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah confirmed it launched a Qadr 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad, which it blames for attacks targeting its members, including the coordinated explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week. It is believed to be the first ballistic missile to be launched by Hezbollah toward Israel, and was fired “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza” and in “defense of Lebanon and its people,” Hezbollah said. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted near Tel Aviv, a city of more than 4 million people on the Mediterranean coast, and the air force struck its launcher in the area of Nafakhiyeh, southern Lebanon. “Following the sirens that sounded in the Tel Aviv and Netanya areas, one surface-to-surface missile was identified crossing from Lebanon and was intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array,” the Israeli military said. Israeli military spokesperson Nadav Shoshani described the missile as “heavy” and “long range.” “It’s the first time that Hezbollah has fired toward Tel Aviv,” he said. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly said that any Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital would prompt an attack on Israel’s economic center. Israel and Hezbollah’s exchange of fire continued Wednesday. Damage is seen at the site of an Israeli strike that hit the Lebanese seaside town of Jiyeh early on Wednesday.

Hasan Fneich/AFP/Getty Images The Israeli military said it hit more than 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Wednesday. At least 51 people were killed in Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the country’s minister of health. Firass Abiad said “large waves” of people had been displaced across the country. Meanwhile, around 40 projectiles crossed from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday morning, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Several were intercepted but one hit an assisted-living facility in northern Israel, with no injuries reported. Since the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas last October, Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets and drones from Lebanon targeting northern Israel. About 60,000 people have been evacuated from Israel’s northern region as a result of the cross-border fighting. Israel has maintained that fighting will continue until it is safe for those residents to return home. The missile intercept comes days after Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah killed more than 500 people across Lebanon, including dozens of children. Monday was the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly two decades. Flights at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport continued as usual Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said. Sirens were heard Wednesday in Netanya for the first time since October 7, 2023, according to Israeli authorities. Misery in Lebanon In recent days, Israel and Hezbollah have traded waves of airstrikes and rocket attacks, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes in southern Lebanon. Israel has said it is targeting Hezbollah positions and infrastructure — which it has said are embedded in residential areas — with one strike killing a senior commander , Ibrahim Qubaisi, on Tuesday. The Israeli military said Qubaisi commanded various Hezbollah missile units and was killed along with two other commanders in southern Beirut. Residents who have fled their homes in Lebanon said residential areas had been flattened and whole towns emptied. One man told CNN he witnessed “non-stop bombardment from every direction” which he described as “indiscriminate bombing.” A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on the village of Sujud.

Meanwhile Lebanese hospitals are struggling with the influx of wounded, and there are difficulties getting those in need to hospital for treatment as roads were congested with people trying to flee from Israeli strikes. British-Palestinian doctor Ghassan Abu-Sittah said the healthcare system is “very, very fragile” as it cannot cope with more than 2,000 injuries in two days. “We have received children with unfortunately, the same pattern of injuries that I used to see in Gaza,” Abu-Sittah told CNN. “Blast injuries in the face, amputations to the limbs, multiple shrapnel injuries, crushing injuries as a result of houses being demolished on top of them.” An estimated half a million people have been displaced in Lebanon, the country’s foreign minister said Tuesday, with that number set to rise further. Om Hussein’s family were among the thousands who fled the country’s south.

That war, however, was not at the top of the agenda in talks with US officials. US President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed instead prioritized their discussions around a set of technological and economic deals between both countries centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and the infrastructure needed to develop the growing technology. “The UAE is a nation of trailblazers that’s always looking to the future – always making big bets… In fact, it’s a cornerstone of our growing cooperation, in AI, in clean energy, in space, in investing in infrastructure to connect regions,” Biden said in the Oval Office on Monday alongside the UAE president. “Today we honor that legacy in carrying our relationship forward as the UAE will become a major defense partner with the United States.” Sheikh Mohammed responded that the UAE has “a firm and unwavering commitment to work with the USA for the sake of deepening the strategic partnership between our two nations” The White House said the leaders charted “an ambitious course” to lead global efforts to develop and expand advanced technologies. Clipped From Video video Related video The UAE is aiming to be an AI superpower The UAE, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020, is looking for a “different architecture” in the region based on “greater communication, stability and, I would say, longer term prosperity,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE president’s diplomatic adviser told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview. The UAE president’s visit to the US “was mostly and almost exclusively about the future,” Gargash said. “It was about the economy. It’s about technology, and about the UAE bid to partner in what is the technology of the future…The AI component was “front and center in the discussion.” The UAE is the second-largest Arab economy, a top oil exporter and major investor in the US economy. One of the US’ closest allies in the Middle East and a major recipient of US arms, it hosts 5,000 US military personnel. It now seeks to significantly upgrade the “360-degree relationship,” according to Gargash, through an ambitious plan to become a regional technology and AI hub as the US moves to protect its national security and tech industries from Chinese influence. The UAE’s relationship with China had already cost Abu Dhabi a multi-billion-dollar weapons deal with the US which would have seen the Gulf country become the first Arab nation to receive F-35 fighter jets, the crown jewel of the US Air Force, as one official told CNN in 2021 . Abandoning advanced Chinese technology The deal, struck under the Donald Trump administration, was seen as a reward for the UAE’s normalization of relations with Israel in 2020. But the Biden administration repeatedly pushed the UAE to drop China’s Huawei Technologies Co. from its telecommunications network, and claimed that the technology could pose a security risk for its weapons systems. Wary of being deprived of US technology, the UAE has since abandoned closer cooperation with China in the field of AI and semiconductors in favor of the US. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi’s state-backed technology firm G42 announced it had agreed not to engage with Chinese companies for advanced technology. The Financial Times reported earlier this year that the company had off-loaded all investments in China as a pledge to its commitment for its “US partners.” In Washington on Tuesday, Sheikh Mohamed met with the chief executives of chipmaker NVIDIA, asset manager Blackrock and Microsoft – three US firms that recently partnered with MGX , an Abu Dhabi-owned firm seeking to raise $100 billion to fund AI infrastructure, AI-enabled technology, and semiconductors in the US and beyond. Despite the focus on technology, discussions with US officials did include the war in Gaza and Lebanon, Gargash said, adding that de-escalation is the “main goal.” Beyond providing humanitarian aid in Gaza, Abu Dhabi has so far refused to contribute to the rebuilding of the territory without a clear commitment by Israel for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “It’s very complicated,” Gargash, who previously served as the UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, said. “We think that maximalist views are hindering the sort of consensus on a day after (the war). And we’re worried without a clear day after, any attempt really at the ceasefire might appear futile.” Still, he defended the UAE’s decision to normalize relations with Israel and said the agreement is a “component of a future Middle East that is based on compromise” and one that could provide a “different architecture” for the region. He said the two pillars of the UAE’s policy are stability and prosperity. “I think we also have a responsibility towards regional stability and regional prosperity….You can’t prosper alone. You have to prosper collectively.”"

In recent days, senior US officials had largely stopped making a vigorous push on the ceasefire negotiations, sources told CNN, having determined there is currently no political will on either side – Hamas or Israel’s – to end the conflict. Even as President Joe Biden and top aides refuse to abandon the effort entirely, a senior Democrat close to the White House summed up the sentiment among some officials involved in those deliberations this way: “We can’t want this more than they want it.” This person also cited a famous line from former Secretary of State James Baker, who in 1990 famously said in a message directed at the Israeli government about a Middle East peace deal: “When you’re serious about this, call us.” Another quote circulating among American officials as they assess the stalled talks is George Mitchell’s description of the process that eventually brought about the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland: “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.” Ending the Gaza conflict is Biden’s top foreign policy goal as he nears the end of his one-term presidency, but the stalled ceasefire talks are threatening to sink the president’s other priorities in the Middle East. With the clock ticking, Biden only made a perfunctory call for a ceasefire during his final United Nations address on Tuesday and planned to discuss the matter with foreign counterparts this week in New York. US officials are still in the early stages of assessing the volatile situation in Lebanon and trying to make sense of whether Israel has a well-defined end-goal when it comes to its northern neighbor. In the immediate aftermath of Israel’s covert attacks that exploded thousands of pagers and walkie talkies across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah operatives, the administration was working to determine how much the group’s capabilities had been degraded as a result. Absent a clear strategy from Israel, they are left hoping Israel’s onslaught might force Hezbollah to the table while avoiding any miscalculation that triggers a regional war. American officials see the two conflicts — in Gaza and now in Lebanon — as difficult to separate, despite Israel’s insistence that it sees them as distinct issues. “It’s a bit of a false dichotomy to suggest that any of these pieces are completely separable from the mass,” a senior State Department official said Monday. Each of them has a logic and set of dynamics to itself, but they are mutually reinforcing in many ways. “So, what we’re trying to do is, even as we continue to try to get at the core conflict that has created so much suffering over the last year, we are equally focused on ensuring that this conflict does not expand, does not intensify and engulf the entire region,” the official said. Some inside the Biden administration believe a change in approach could help hasten the end of the conflict, including bypassing the three-phase deal currently being discussed and moving to a new effort that would lay out in one go the conditions both parties would need to agree to stop fighting. No Plan B right now But there are no indications the US is actively preparing to push for any Plan B for the time being. In fact, there are currently no known plans for some of Biden’s top national security deputies who have made countless treks to the Middle East over the last year to try to facilitate a ceasefire and hostages deal – including CIA Director Bill Burns, Secretary of State Antony Blinken or White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk – to visit Israel with that goal in mind. When Blinken was last in the region earlier this month, his trip notably omitted a stop in Israel. And it’s been more than a month since Biden last spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he doesn’t plan to meet with the Israeli leader when he comes to the United States this week for his own UN speech. Some US officials are concerned that the week of speeches in New York could further inflame tensions, but they are also actively working to setup meetings on the sidelines that could drive forth ideas to end the conflict. Biden’s speech at UNGA Tuesday contained no new proposal for breaking the logjam but claimed that a diplomatic solution is still possible.  American officials continue to describe the talks as essentially moribund, with political will lacking on either side to reach an agreement. An American-drafted “bridging proposal” has yet to be formalized for presentation to Biden or either of the parties in the talks. “There have been difficulties and setbacks. We’ve had challenges getting the prime minister across the line. We’ve had challenges getting Hamas’ leader, Sinwar, across the line. But we’re determined to keep at it,” said Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday on MSNBC. “We stay up nights trying to figure out a way to get across the line on this ceasefire and hostage deal. And we have spoken out directly about our concern when we’ve seen the prime minister not take steps that we think are necessary to get to that deal,” he said. “At the moment, I would say the biggest challenge is actually that Hamas and Sinwar don’t want to do a deal. But if they do, if, if they’re prepared to come to the table, it’ll be incumbent on us to get the prime minister to the table and close this thing out.” As US officials increasingly acknowledge what appears to be the increasingly likely possibility that a ceasefire will not materialize before Biden’s term ends in January, they also accept that that means the president will not see a landmark Saudi Arabia-Israel normalization deal agreed before he leaves office. Unlike in last year’s UN speech, Biden made no mention of the possibility of Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel, which could transform the region, in his address. That likely leaves it to the next president to either continue pursuing such an arrangement or to head in a different direction. Vice President Kamala Harris has frequently cited the importance of reaching a ceasefire and hostage deal but hasn’t detailed any new approach in reaching an agreement. “Ultimately the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done,” she said last week. “I’m not going to disclose private conversations, but I will tell you I’ve had direct conversations with the prime minister, with the president of Israel, with Egyptian leaders and with our allies, and I think we’ve made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done.” Still, if the window for a ceasefire and hostages deal before the end of Biden’s presidency is slowly closing, US officials insist there is always the possibility of an unexpected turn of events in the Middle East that could quickly shift the narrative. The death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is seen as one of the biggest potential game changers. Israeli and American officials alike would heavily celebrate the outcome, and Sinwar’s killing is perhaps among the most widely discussed singular events that has the best shot of prompting an abrupt end to the war. It has been a few weeks since Sinwar last responded to messages from mediators looking to secure a hostage deal, but American officials have not received updated information about his condition."

Terror and despair gripped Lebanese residents as Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others, authorities said, as residents fled their homes desperate to reach safety. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is changing the “balance of power” on its northern front as its military said it struck 1,600 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon on Monday, followed by more strikes the following day, and has not ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion. On Tuesday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of one of its senior commanders, Ibrahim Qubaisi. The Israeli military earlier claimed it had killed the commander in an airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Several countries have warned the strikes increase the risk of a wider regional war and have called for urgent international pressure to de-escalate the situation. Despite the scale and intensity of Monday’s strikes, neither side is calling the current escalation a war. Here’s what we know. What happened? On Monday, Israel intensified its air campaign on Hezbollah, launching “extensive strikes” targeting the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. It marked the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war and hit multiple parts of the country, mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country near Lebanon’s border with Syria and where the militant group has a strong presence. Women, children and medics were among those killed and wounded, Lebanon’s health ministry said Monday. It is unclear how many of the casualties were civilians or Hezbollah militants, but many of the locations described by Israel as Hezbollah targets are also residential neighborhoods and villages. Israel said that among the Hezbollah targets were “cruise missiles” that had a reach of hundreds of kilometers, rockets, and explosive warheads, according to military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, who claimed the munitions were stored in civilian homes. Residents began to flee their homes after their phones began pinging with text messages from Israel and calls from unknown numbers urging them to evacuate immediately. A popular Lebanese radio station said it was hacked and its broadcast interrupted by an Israeli evacuation warning. The Israeli military warned civilians to leave areas in which Hezbollah operates , such as those used to store weapons. Residents said they had little time to flee to safety before the bombing started. One resident in the southern city of Tyre on the coast of Lebanon said he heard Israeli warplanes “raining” bombs near his home from 5 a.m. local time on Monday. Classes in schools and universities were canceled across the country and some flights to and from Beirut were suspended. Many schools were closed to be used as shelters for those seeking refuge. Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet declared a “special situation” across the country, giving it the power to impose restrictions on civilian life including limits on public gatherings, an Israeli official told CNN. The strikes continued throughout Tuesday. An Israeli military spokesperson said 100 projectiles had been fired toward Israel on Tuesday, while Israel said it carried out another round of “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets in Beqaa and several areas of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said it fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel, targeting the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel. It also said it fired rockets at the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, with Israel saying it intercepted most of the projectiles. The Israeli military also said it struck weapons storage facilities in Bint Jbeil, a town in southern Lebanon, after dozens of rockets were fired from the area. Lebanon’s health ministry said six people were killed and 15 injured in the strike on the Ghobeiry neighborhood.

Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, but video shows destruction of residential areas and the large death toll reflects the scale and intensity of the strikes. The nearly 500 killed on Monday alone is roughly half the number of Lebanese killed throughout the entire 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Israeli warplanes were also seen flying over different parts of the country late afternoon, including over Mount Lebanon where Hezbollah does not have a notable presence. Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations General Assembly said there was a mass “exodus” of people fleeing. One Lebanese NGO said more than 100,000 people had been displaced. Residents described seeing buildings collapse and towns being emptied, while images and video show roads blocked by heavy traffic in both directions as people try to flee. Reuters video  from the southern suburbs of Beirut showed debris from damaged buildings and shards of glass littering the ground.

Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said convoys of vehicles evacuating people from areas under fire had been “targeted,” as had two ambulances, a fire truck and a medical center. Two first responders were killed, he added. The death toll on Tuesday climbed to 558 people – including 50 children and 94 women – with a further 1,835 people injured, Abiad said. “We remain in the war and remain in the throes of the attacks. Our responsibilities have not ended,” Abiad added as Israel continued its attacks on Tuesday. The Israeli military said it was trying to “mitigate the harm to Lebanese civilians as much as possible,” Hagari said. Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of long using civilians as human shields while aiming rockets at Israeli citizens. More than 16,500 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the Israeli strikes, the country’s coordinator of government’s emergency preparedness told CNN Tuesday. Why is Israel attacking Lebanon? Hezbollah and Israel have been in conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October, when Israel’s war in Gaza began following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began. The group has said it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on. The increasing escalations have once again brought the region to the edge of an all-out war. Last week, Hezbollah – one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the region – was left reeling after a deadly twin attack by Israel, when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members simultaneously exploded across the country. The attack was followed by an Israeli strike on a building in a densely populated southern Beirut, which killed at least 45 people including a top commander and other senior operatives, as well as women and children.

Fadel Itani/AFP/Getty Images The following days saw some of the most intense exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in almost a year of war in Gaza, as the Lebanese militant group fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than has previously been seen and Israel fired hundreds of projectiles into southern Lebanon. It came as Israel made a new war objective to return displaced residents to their homes near the northern border after being evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks. On Monday, Netanyahu said Israel was changing the “security balance” of power in the north, and separately told the security cabinet the country’s aim in Lebanon is to cut “Hezbollah from the war with Hamas,” an Israeli official told CNN. Though weakened militarily and its secretive lines of communication exposed, Hezbollah’s second-in-command has declared “a new chapter” in the confrontations which he called “a battle without limits.” Are Lebanon and Israel at war? While the airstrikes, attacks and rhetoric from both Israel and Hezbollah suggest they are in open conflict, neither side is calling the current escalation a war. The head of Israel’s military Herzi Halevi said it is “preparing for the next phases” and Netanyahu in a televised speech told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah. Iran has warned Israel of “dangerous consequences” following the strikes, with Iran’s president telling CNN on Monday that it risks tipping the region into wider conflict.

Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Leon Panetta told CNN the situation has “crossed a threshold” and warned that “we’re clearly walking into a much wider war.” World leaders will be gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly this week and there are feverish efforts behind the scenes to convince Israel not to escalate further and launch a ground incursion into Lebanon. Though the United States is Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier, a senior State Department official said the US and its partners are attempting to find a diplomatic solution . The US believes that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, but a major concern is that Iran, a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, US officials told CNN.

Sign up here. CNN — After nearly a year of fighting in Gaza, Israel is ramping up hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon, with covert operations targeting communications devices and a ferocious bombing campaign that has left hundreds dead. The fight against Hamas has strained the Israeli military, with soldiers receiving little respite, officials citing army shortages, the economy facing its steepest decline in years, and growing public pressure for a ceasefire and a hostage deal. It is unclear whether Israel intends – or will feel compelled – to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon. But the question looms: Can the country take on a second front? Since October 8, the day after Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, there has been regular cross-border fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks. The stakes were raised last week when Israel injured thousands of people across Lebanon, detonating pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. Escalating exchanges of fire have followed. Should Israel enter full-scale war with Hezbollah, experts say it will face a much stronger threat than Hamas – and commensurate costs. “Hezbollah is not Hamas,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv who served in Israel’s National Security Council under three prime ministers. Hezbollah is “a state within a state” with far more sophisticated military capabilities, he told CNN. Over the weekend , the group launched one of its deepest strikes into Israel, with the Israeli military reporting impacts in Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom and Moreshet near the port city of Haifa, around 40 km (25 miles) south of the border.

Chris McGrath/Getty Images The cross-border exchange over the past year has already led to more than 62,000 residents being evacuated from their homes in Israel’s north, and the deaths of 26 Israeli civilians and 22 soldiers and reservists, according to Israeli media. Ahead of the weekend’s escalation, over 94,000 had been displaced and more than 740 killed on the Lebanese side, including some 500 Hezbollah fighters, according to Reuters. Israeli strikes since Monday alone have killed at least another 558 people and led to the displacement of 16,500, according to Lebanese authorities. Here are some of Israel’s main challenges in a potential wider conflict with Hezbollah: A stronger enemy Iran’s closest regional partner, the Shiite Islamist group has not only showcased more sophisticated weaponry over the past year, but it also boasts strategic depth through its allies and partners across the Middle East – including in Iraq and Yemen. While Israel’s military capabilities have improved since its last war in Lebanon in 2006 – when the Jewish state did not yet have its Iron Dome defense system – so has Hezbollah’s arsenal. Military analysts estimate Hezbollah to have between 30,000 and 50,000 troops, but earlier this year its leader Hassan Nasrallah claimed it has more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles. Its biggest military asset is the long-range ballistic missile, of which it is estimated to have thousands, including 1,500 precision missiles with ranges of 250–300 kilometers (155–186 miles). During the weekend attack, Hezbollah said it targeted Israel’s Ramat David airbase with Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, longer-range weapons that are believed to have been used for the first time. The base is some 30 miles from the Lebanese border. The Israeli military did not respond to queries about whether the base was impacted. Israeli emergency services reported that three people were wounded in the attacks. ⁠Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank in Washington DC who focuses on Iran and its proxies, said that the “warhead weight of these projectiles is reminiscent of the heavy Burkan IRAM (improved rocket assisted munition) first introduced last winter against Israel by Hezbollah, but at considerably longer range.” Hezbollah’s attacks using these projectiles “are likely a way the group aims to save face without losing its head following the communications attacks and strike on senior leaders last week by Israel,” Ben Taleblu told CNN. Orna Mizrahi, a Hezbollah expert at INSS said that much of Israel’s ability to fight a two-front war rests on US support. “The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) can fight both fronts for a long time, and we have the capabilities to do it if we have the ammunition from the Americans,” Mizrahi said, adding that if there is a full-scale war, the US will likely intervene to support Israel. Israel also has a huge intelligence advantage, most notably seen in last week’s audacious attacks on Hezbollah’s communications. Stretched military Israel is a small state and its military manpower is not limitless. As it gears up for a possible second war, the IDF is diverting some of its key divisions from Gaza to its northern border. “When you are fighting more than one front, you cannot invest too much in every front,” Mizrahi said. “So it will be a different way of fighting.” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant last week said that “the center of gravity is moving north,” and that “forces, resources, energy” are now being moved. Among those units is Israel’s elite 98th Division. Also known as Utzbat HaEsh, this paratrooper division is believed to consist of 10,000 to 20,000 troops, according to Israeli media. Guzansky said that diverting resources toward Lebanon does not mean the Gaza war is over, but that Netanyahu feels compelled to deal with the northern front amid mounting domestic pressure to facilitate the return of evacuees from the area. Analysts and army officials cited in Israeli media have also repeatedly said the IDF is suffering from shortages. At the outset of the war with Hamas, the military recruited about 295,000 reservists in an effort to boost its manpower. But that number is proving insufficient.

Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images The fighting in Gaza and elsewhere has also taken its toll on soldiers, of whom 715 have so far been killed since October 7, including in the north. “This is the longest (war) of its kind in Israel’s history, longer than the War of Independence in 1948,” Guzansky said, adding that this is Hezbollah and Iran’s goal, “to weaken Israel gradually.” “To fire rockets every day, on a low scale, and to occupy the IDF, to overstretch the IDF,” he said. An economy in decline Israel’s economy has been one of the biggest casualties of the war in Gaza, taking a sharp blow from the early days of the October 7 attack. Thousands of businesses suffered as reservists abandoned their civilian lives to take up arms, and the country’s economy is shrinking at an alarming rate. “It’s devastating on the Israeli economy, on Israeli society,” Guzansky said, adding that the impacts will live on for years to come. Of all 38 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Israel showed the sharpest economic slowdown between April and June of this year, the organization said in its quarterly report. According to OECD data, Israel’s economy shrank by 4.1% in the early months of the war, and continued to contract, albeit at a slower rate, throughout the first and second quarters of 2024. First responders and Israeli security forces gather amid debris and charred vehicles in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel, following a reported strike by Lebanon's Hezbollah on September 22. Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images The contracting economy comes as Israel’s military spending skyrockets. Earlier this year, Amir Yaron, the governor of Israel’s central bank, warned that the war is expected to cost Israel up to 253 billion Israeli shekels ($67 billion) between 2023 and 2025, Israeli media reported . That’s almost 13% of Israel’s GDP, in addition to regular military expenditure, which has stood at an annual 4.5% to 6.5% of GDP, according to World Bank data. An expansion of the conflict has also impacted Israel’s credit rating, making it more expensive to take on debt, with multiple rating agencies downgrading the country since the war began. In a statement last month , credit ratings agency Moody’s warned that an all-out war with Hezbollah or Iran could have significant “credit consequences for Israeli debt issuers.” A legitimacy crisis A second front, especially one that could be far more damaging to Lebanon than to Israel, could be the final straw for many countries already critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, experts said. The global sympathy that Israel received in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack has turned into sharp criticism due to Israel’s devastating reaction, as it now faces accusations of war crimes and genocide in international courts, which it strongly denies. Domestically, while Israelis showed a greater appetite for fighting at the outset of the Gaza war, polls show that domestic support has waned over the last months. On support for a war with Hezbollah, Israelis appear split on the matter. A survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute think tank in July found that 42% of Israelis think their country should pursue a diplomatic agreement with Hezbollah, despite the chances of an additional conflict in the future, while 38% think Israel should pursue a military victory against the group, even at the cost of significant damage to civilian areas. Despite the split in opinion, there is now less support for war with Hezbollah compared to responses in late 2023, the poll said. Guzansky said that pressure for war is likely more palpable in northern Israel, where “people that don’t have businesses anymore, families (are) broken apart… people (are) being killed.” Many of these residents, who have lived close to the frontline for nearly a year, believe that “only a full-scale war can change the reality in the north,” he added."

Hezbollah began launching drone and rocket attacks against Israel one day later, sparking months of hostilities across what had been Israel’s quietest border for years. The situation escalated last week when Israel carried out covert attacks that detonated Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel followed up by pounding Beirut and southern Lebanon with airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians and Hezbollah leaders in recent days. The group has responded with rocket attacks targeting Israeli sites including Ramat David air base east of Haifa. The US assesses that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, officials said. But a senior State Department official expressed skepticism to reporters Monday about Israel’s “escalate to de-escalate” strategy. “I can’t recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation,” the State Department official told reporters Monday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The biggest concern right now is that Iran, which is a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, the first official said. Tehran has not intervened yet, but they will if they believe they are about to lose their most powerful proxy force, Hezbollah, the official added. On Monday, Nasser Kanaani, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, warned of “dangerous consequences” following Israel’s strikes. Israel has already seriously degraded the militant group over the last week, the first official said, killing several senior commanders and significantly impacting Hezbollah’s command and control structure, multiple officials said. “They’ve probably been taken 20 years backwards,” another official said of the combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah. The Pentagon announced Monday that the US is deploying more troops to the Middle East “out of an abundance of caution” as tensions have continued to rise in the region. The crisis increases the stakes of President Joe Biden’s speech to General Assembly on Tuesday, but expectations he can ratchet down tensions are likely to be low, especially considering the US efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have floundered. Allies scrambling for ‘concrete ideas’ Allies at the global gathering in New York are scrambling to come up with “concrete ideas” to de-escalate the situation that threatens to destabilize the region. The senior State Department official did not say if the US expects Israel to carry out a ground incursion in Lebanon if those de-escalation efforts fail but noted that it is “important for everyone to take Israeli preparations seriously.” “I would not infer from the pace or intensity of Israeli strikes on a given day, the success or failure of our efforts to get them to act with a degree of restraint,” the State Department official added. On Monday, Israel carried out strikes against 1,600 Hezbollah targets, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said, going after long-range cruise missiles and heavy rockets capable of hitting deep within Israel. Hagari said the weapons were hidden “at the heart of the villages, within civilian homes.” The massive aerial bombardment left at least 492 dead in Lebanon, according to the country’s health ministry, including 35 children and 58 women. At least 1,645 people were injured, the ministry said. The single-day death toll made it the deadliest 24 hours of conflict in the country since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The IDF said Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets toward Israel on Monday, some of which were intercepted over Haifa, the third largest city in the country and the largest city in northern Israel. Israel has told the US that a full-scale war is not the intent of its strikes, according to an Israeli official. Instead, Israel’s goal is to return 70,000 citizens, displaced since Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones on October 8, to their homes near the border with Lebanon. The goal is a diplomatic solution through escalation, the Israeli official said. But the IDF would not rule out the possibility of a ground incursion, an enormous operation that would likely require the call up a significant number of reserves and the relocation of Israeli forces to the border with Lebanon. “Is the army prepared?” Hagari asked rhetorically at a press briefing Monday. “Yes, the army is in full readiness and we will do whatever is necessary to bring back home all our citizens to the northern border safely.” The operation which caused the pagers and walkie-talkies to explode, carried out by the Mossad and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), rattled Hezbollah’s ability to communicate, officials said, especially after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah urged the militant organization in February to avoid cell phones. But even after suffering a major blow, Hezbollah remains a more formidable foe to Israel than Hamas in Gaza, with a pre-war arsenal estimated at 150,000 rockets and missiles, a stockpile built and improved with the help of Iran. Israel’s cabinet declared a “special situation” across the entire country, allowing it to impose drastic restrictions on civilian life. Those restrictions, including school closures and limits on public gatherings, are currently limited to northern Israel and near Gaza. In a sign of how seriously the government views the situation, hospitals in northern Israel were ordered to move their patients to fortified areas. Meanwhile, officials are waiting to see how Iran will react. Tehran is yet to respond militarily to the July assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian promised Monday that his country would still seek revenge. “Ismail Haniyeh was our guest. It was the day that I became the president,” Pezeshkian said at the UN. “Israel came and hit and made him a so-called martyr in order to expand the war in the region and create instability in the region.”"

As he prepares for his final high-profile speech at the United Nations on Tuesday , the crisis is overshadowing any attempt at burnishing his foreign policy legacy. Without any near-term hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza, Biden is facing new questions about his approach to the nearly year-long conflict. White House officials watched with concern over the weekend as Israeli warplanes struck targets in Lebanon while Hezbollah fired rockets and drones into northern Israel. As Biden was meeting Asia-Pacific leaders in Delaware, the crisis was unfolding in a different part of the world. The president and his aides were closely monitoring the situation from Wilmington. Biden’s aides currently view the risk of escalation as serious and real, and have been communicating on a daily basis with officials in Israel, officials said Monday. “The risk of escalation is real; it has been since October 7. There are moments where it is more acute than others. I think we are in one of those moments where it is more acute,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Speaking Sunday, Biden said he was concerned about escalation in the Middle East. But he reaffirmed his view that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas – which American officials believe would lower temperatures across the region – was still possible. “We’re going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we’re still pushing hard,” he told reporters at the White House His optimism masked fading hopes among administration officials that a deal can be reached before Biden leaves office. The president and his top national security officials have spent the past year working to prevent the war in Gaza from spreading to a wider regional conflict, with the northern front with Lebanon their chief concern. Amos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser, has spent the past several months working to prevent a second front from opening in the north, including a trip just last week meant to head off a wider escalation in the long-simmering tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Yet there have been no high-level phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Biden is not currently scheduled to met the Israeli leader when he’s in the United States at the end of this week. Sullivan told reporters on Saturday that while the risk of escalation was “acute,” there remained avenues to ease tensions. “We actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure, and we’re going to do everything that we can to bring that about,” he said. As world leaders gather in New York for the general assembly this week, some US officials are concerned that the global gathering could further enflame mounting tensions in the Middle East, two US officials said. The concern is concentrated on what countries around the world might say about the conflict while the entire world is watching, even as the US officials have been urging de-escalation for months and have reiterated that call in recent days. Typically US officials view UNGA as an opportunity to galvanize the world behind a major US push – such as supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggressions in recent years – making the anxiety that US officials are feeling this year unique. US officials are particularly bracing for the possibility of new countries recognizing Palestine as a state. Even if new countries are not added to the effort to recognize Palestine, they are watching for what the countries say that have already made the move earlier this year, such as US allies Norway, Spain and Ireland. The US will also have eyes on the speech by the leader of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, and a possible speech by Netanyahu if he attends the gathering, which is a question that remains in the air.

It’s a risky approach that could backfire long-term.","Sep 23, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Nick Paton Walsh,Middle East,"CNN — Wars of peace are rarely successful. They are normally of choice: pre-emptively attacking to neutralize a perceived threat. Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck in the tit-for-tat horror of escalation chicken for nearly a year. But over the past week Israel has clearly decided to massively amplify its attacks on the Iran-backed militant group, claiming, according to some reports, they seek to “escalate to deescalate” – to cow their adversary into a diplomatic solution. It is a highly risky and likely flawed mantra, perhaps designed to dupe their frustrated ally, the United States, into believing that the diplomatic solution, which Washington has now sunk an almost embarrassing amount of energy into, is still also Israel’s goal. But the greater the harm inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the more likely a shorter-term Israeli success has seemed. A full-scale ground war between a tired, divided Israeli military and an experienced, angry Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon would likely be disastrous for Israel. It is exactly what the militant group is good at and waiting for. Yet it is also something Israel does not for now need to get into. The past week has shown the technological chasm between the two adversaries. One must resort to technology from two decades ago to evade Israeli spyware and surveillance. The other is able to infiltrate the limited supply chain of that very device – thousands of pagers of Taiwanese design – and implant explosives that maim hundreds of senior Hezbollah operatives simultaneously, while also killing children and wounding thousands of others. Were that brutally clinical assault not enough, 24 hours later they killed yet more militants by detonating a series of walkie-talkie bombs , even at funerals for those assassinated the day before. In the ensuing panic, Israel appears able to have spotted Hezbollah members making enough mistakes that over a dozen senior figures, and a very senior commander, Ibrahim Aqil, were assassinated at the same time in a huge blast in southern Beirut Friday. And throughout it all, Hezbollah positions were hit in the south of Lebanon by repeated airstrikes. There has been significant damage to command, control, morale and equipment, all without a single Israeli boot on the ground. It is important to not dismiss the psychological and operational impact of an attack such as the pager onslaught would have on any adversary. Hezbollah members likely don’t know who in their number is left to contact or how; they will scatter; they will seek a direction; they will perhaps fail to settle on a unified response; they may even waste a little time in succession infighting. In time, they may rise and strike back harshly, but for now Israel is exploiting the initial chaos ruthlessly.

Shir Torem/Reuters Related article Hezbollah fires rockets deep into northern Israel as tensions flare. Here’s what we know Where does the “de-escalation” fit in? The Israeli hope is presumably that Hezbollah feels so damaged, and so greatly fears further damage to Lebanon’s civilians, that it agrees to withdraw to the north of the Litani River, and bow to its adversary’s demands in such a way that Israeli civilians are allowed to return home in the north of their country. It would be tough for Hassan Nasrallah – Hezbollah’s measured and focused leader who also pushed his men towards pagers from smartphones – to project weakness like that after the past week. He may be able to sell such a strategy out of necessity as one of strategic patience – to suggest this is their only choice to save Lebanon and they may later live to fight another day – but it would be tough. The Israelis, who seem to have thoroughly penetrated Hezbollah’s communications, likely have a better handle on the militant’s internal deliberations than they state in public. They may have assessed Nasrallah must eventually back down, as his organization has been exposed as weakened after expending so many experienced fighters in Syria’s civil war. Conversely, they might have calculated that Nasrallah truly is backed into a corner, and will have to lash out with a sustained rocket barrage against Israeli towns. That would leave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if a larger conflagration begins, with the unconvincing, binary justification of: “They started it.” Emergency workers use excavators to clear the rubble at the site of Friday's Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs, Lebanon on Monday, September 23. Hassan Ammar/AP Militarily, the past week has been a disaster for Hezbollah. It risks comparison to the moment Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 – when a revered monolith was exposed as neither that modern or potent at all. On the evidence of Hezbollah’s remarkable vulnerabilities in recent days, Israel may feel confident it can continue to hit them hard – that its foe is not really able to strike back meaningfully. Hezbollah can fire better rockets, for sure, but many are intercepted, and they do not have an inexhaustible supply . Does Nasrallah think this is the moment to fire his one big barrage? Or would his allies in Iran prefer him to wait for another time? If Hezbollah withdraws voluntarily – or refuses to, and the violence continues – Israel can still hit target after target with a superior air force, with apparently little concern, for now, that Hezbollah can exact too great a price on its own population centers. Israel has shown in Gaza its disregard for civilian collateral damage. The impact any increased violence is having on ordinary Lebanese will be a double-edged sword: it will extenuate the already advanced hatred for their southern neighbor, but also foment enmity towards the damage and chaos Hezbollah’s attacks have brought to Lebanon. Perhaps Netanyahu – who appears to have set on military solutions alone over the past year, perhaps for reasons of his own personal political furtherance – thinks he can bomb Hezbollah into irrelevance. Israel may, possibly, inflict so much damage it inflicts a qualitative change as to what Hezbollah can do. But wars never just stop there. Hezbollah will rebuild, as its cause is based on a specific place and people – Lebanon and its Shia. The lesson NATO slowly learned in Afghanistan would be wisely heeded here – that killing endless mid-level commanders in hourly night raids leaves you instead with only their angry, radicalized sons left to talk to when you want to negotiate. Israel is flaunting its wizardry in warfare, and able to exact vicious costs as it turns a blind eye to civilian casualties. Yet exactly what road ahead it sees is unclear. It may matter less to Netanyahu’s war cabinet if Hezbollah chooses to retreat or is bombed into it. But the lesson of violence in this region is it has a habit of echoing, often in unexpected and more savage ways, back on its perpetrators in the decades ahead."

On Saturday, Israel pounded Hezbollah targets with nearly 300 strikes in what they described as preemptive action to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah meanwhile has been launching a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel in what it says is retaliation for Israeli attacks in Lebanon. Hezbollah – the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group – has been left reeling after two days of blasts targeting pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members was followed by an Israeli strike on southern Beirut, which killed at least 45 people including a top commander and other senior operatives. Here’s what we know about the escalation of tensions. What’s happened, when and where? On Tuesday and Wednesday, Lebanon was rocked by two similar, surprise attacks . On Tuesday afternoon, pagers exploded at the same time across several parts of Lebanon, including capital Beirut, and in several towns in the central Beqaa valley, strongholds for the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Almost exactly 24 hours later, Lebanon was rocked by a second attack Wednesday, when walkie-talkies detonated in the suburbs of Beirut and in the south of the country. Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad put the death toll from both attacks at 39; 12 on Tuesday and 27 on Wednesday. The exploding devices attacks were followed by an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday, which killed at least 45 including senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil, and levelled a multistory building in a densely populated neighborhood.

Bilal Hussein/AP Related article A limited confrontation with Israel is extracting a seemingly unlimited price from Hezbollah The developments put the region on a knife edge, with Hezbollah targeting northern Israel with a series of rockets and missiles overnight on Saturday into Sunday, striking deeper into Israeli territory than they have done in other recent attacks. The attacks, Hezbollah said, were in response to repeated Israeli strikes in Lebanon that have led to the deaths of “many civilians.” Among the targets, Hezbollah said it hit an air base with Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, a longer-range weapon seemingly not used so far. Most were intercepted but some fell, causing damage. The Israeli military reported impacts in Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom and Moreshet near the port city of Haifa, around 40 km (25 miles) south of the border, marking one of the deepest direct hits by the Iran-backed group since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. Schools have closed in many northern areas of Israel, and gatherings have been restricted. Israel meanwhile fired nearly 300 projectiles into southern Lebanon on Saturday in what the military said was pre-emptive action against a planned Hezbollah attack. Israel continued its strikes into Sunday, with Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reporting two people were killed Sunday morning in southern Lebanon. Will the conflict escalate? Exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have occurred consistently since the outbreak of war in Gaza on October 8, the day after Hamas’ attack on Israel, in skirmishes which have long sparked fears of the fighting spilling over into a wider regional conflict. Key players have at times appeared to walk right up to the brink , but tensions have de-escalated given the grave consequences of an all-out war in the Middle East. However, the intensity of attacks between Israel and Hezbollah seen over the past few days has been unprecedented, renewing fears of a wider war that could drag in the entire region, as well as Israel’s chief ally the United States. Emergency workers use excavators to clear the rubble at the site of Friday's Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Bilal Hussein/AP While Hezbollah’s leader has previously stated he does not want a fully-fledged regional war, experts have said he may now be under more pressure to act following the spate of explosions, and with Israel set on moving its military objectives to its northern border. CNN Related article Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide Israeli President Israel Herzog told Sky News on Sunday said that Israel “is not interested to be at war with Lebanon.” He instead blamed Hezbollah for the military escalation between the two nations. Hezbollah has admitted the attacks have left them weakened but also show little sign of pulling back. Naim Qassim – the group’s second most important figure after leader Hassan Nasrallah – said a “a battle without limits” was now underway. Why did Israel target Lebanon now? Hezbollah and Israel have been in conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October when the war in Gaza began, following Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel. Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the Middle East spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 11 months. The axis has said they will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader. Israel may have chosen this timing for the attacks because it believed Hezbollah had discovered the pagers’ capability – making it a “use it or lose it” moment, said an Israeli source familiar with national security. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also have wanted to shore up domestic support. Officials and residents from the northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes after being evacuated due to attacks, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border – which has long been understood to be a political necessity. Speaking on Sunday, Netanyahu again put the focus on ensuring the return of Israel citizens to their homes in northern Israel and to restore security in that region. Speaking ahead of a government meeting, he said: “If Hezbollah didn’t get the message - I assure you - they will get the message. We are determined to return our citizens in the north to their homes safely.” CNN’s Tamara Qiblawi, Tim Lister, Mick Krever, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Eyad Kourdi, Jessie Yeung, Hamdi Alkhshali and Lauren Izso contributed reporting."

It is unclear how many Palestinians remain north of the so-called Netzarim Corridor , which splits Gaza in two, but estimates run into the hundreds of thousands. The plan does not mention whether, when, or how civilians would be allowed to return to northern Gaza. After nearly a year of war, with no part of Gaza immune from Israeli airstrikes, Palestinians have been increasingly unwilling to heed Israeli demands to relocate. The idea comes from a group of retired Israeli military generals, who have formally presented it to the Israeli cabinet and a powerful parliamentary committee. The goal, they say, is to use siege tactics to starve Hamas fighters and force them to release 101 hostages still held in the territory. Eden Yerushalmi Hostages and Missing Families Forum Related article Slain Israeli hostage held by Hamas in ‘inhuman’ conditions underneath Gaza, sisters tell CNN “Those who leave will receive food and water,” Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli military general who is spearheading the proposal, says in a slickly produced video posted online earlier this month. “But in a week the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory, and this military territory as far as we are concerned, no supplies will enter it.” Israeli national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate, reported on Sunday that Netanyahu, in a closed-door meeting with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said that the plan “makes a lot of sense.” “It is one of the plans being considered, but there are several others,” he said, according to Kan. “We are committed to dismantling the civilian control of Hamas.” It is unclear when the meeting took place. An Israeli official confirmed the veracity of that quote, but said, “seeing it positively does not mean adopting it.” The official said that the head of the Israel Defense Forces’ strategic division will in the coming days present to Netanyahu “several alternatives” for how to “deprive Hamas of civilian control capabilities in Gaza.” Video Ad Feedback Sisters of slain Israeli hostage: ‘They starved her before they murdered her’ 03:35 - Source: CNN Calls to adopt plan In a letter obtained by CNN, 27 members of Knesset – including three sitting ministers – have written to the government urging them to adopt it. The public face of the proposal is Eiland, who had an illustrious career rising to the rank of major general and serving as head of the prime minister’s National Security Council from 2004 to 2006. “The reality today in Gaza is that Sinwar is really not stressed,” he says in the video. “The right thing to do is to inform the approximately 300,000 residents who remained in the northern Gaza Strip, citizen residents, of the following: Not that we are suggesting you leave the northern Gaza Strip, we are ordering you to leave the northern Gaza Strip.” “In a week, the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory. And this military territory, as far as we are concerned, no supplies will enter it. That is why 5,000 terrorists who are in this situation, they can either surrender or starve.” “Dictators like Sinwar are not afraid of military pressure. They are afraid of two other things: a governmental alternative and the existence of an angry mob that can overthrow them.” The Commanders and Reserve Fighters Forum, a group of retired and reservist commanders, has championed the plan “to bring about a de facto change in the war situation.” It is not clear what the senior leadership of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) thinks of the plan. When asked for comment on the proposal, the IDF referred CNN to the Prime Minister’s Office. The plan does not tackle the question of whether Palestinians could ever return to northern Gaza, one of its backers told CNN. Video Ad Feedback Hear from children living in makeshift homes on the shores of Gaza 01:47 - Source: CNN “It will all depend on what will happen in the future,” Retired Major-General Gershon Hacohen said in a text message. “But there is no indication in the plan that they will never be able to go back.” The generals’ group claims to have presented the plan to the Israeli cabinet “several times.” The Prime Minister’s Office would not confirm to CNN whether those meetings took place. The plan has been presented to the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Meirav Cohen, a member of Knesset from the centrist Yesh Atid party, lambasted the government for allowing aid trucks into Gaza. “The only threat that they are facing is obesity,” she said during a meeting with the pressure group, including Giora Eiland. “Is this how we will bring our hostages back home? So I think that the plan that Giora and other commanders presented here is very smart. It sets clear rules. We have to implement it.” In the letter addressed to Netanyahu and his fellow ministers, 27 of the 120 members of Knesset lament that “we have not yet reached the finish line in any of the goals defined by the War Cabinet.” They call on the government to implement Eiland’s plan in northern Gaza. “After carrying out the program in this area, it is possible to carry it out in other parts of the strip,” they say."

A spokesman for the Gaza Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal, said the missile hit the Al-Zaytoun School, near Gaza City, where thousands were sheltering. The Government Media Office in Gaza said 13 children, including a 3-month-old infant were killed. Other children needed amputations, the GMO said. The Israeli military said that the compound was being used as a Hamas command center and precautions had been taken to avoid civilian casualties. Aircraft “conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a Hamas command and control center in Gaza City” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. “The command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served as the Al Falah School, was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and carry out terrorist attacks.” CNN is unable to verify whether Hamas operatives were present at the compound.

We were sitting in the schools, and suddenly missiles started raining down on us. There was no warning. Where is the conscience?” The woman, who did not give her name, added: “My message is that this war and the bloodshed should make you wake up. All of you are numb and don’t feel anything … No schools, no hospitals, no food, no water. Shame on you.” A girl who said her name was Amal, and was also sheltering at the school, asked: “What have we, the children, done to wake up and go to sleep in fear? At least stop the bombing of schools. We have no schools, no homes — where should we go? “Everyone was martyred, all of them were martyred, torn to pieces,” she said. “The Arab countries are afraid and don’t want to intervene — why are you scared? What is our fault? Call for a truce and end this. What’s wrong with you?” asked Amal. Amid a flare-up in tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Israel continues to operate in Gaza where it is seeking to destroy Hamas following the October 7 attacks, claiming the killing of a prominent Hamas operative and several other fighters. The IDF also said Saturday that troops had recently detected “armed militants” robbing a humanitarian aid truck in the Rafah area, without giving a date. While securing the humanitarian route, the IDF said, “troops identified armed militants robbing a humanitarian aid truck. In a swift operation, the troops directed drones that located the militants fleeing in a car, and they were eliminated by IAF aircraft.” The security of humanitarian convoys has been an issue for aid agencies, with looting a frequent problem.

Ibrahim Aqil, part of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, was assassinated along with several other commanders, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, accusing them of planning to raid and occupy communities in Galilee in northern Israel. Hezbollah confirmed Aqil’s death, saying he was killed “following a treacherous Israeli assassination operation.” Aqil had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States for his suspected involvement in the 1983 strike on the US Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, as well as the bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year. According to Hagari, the targeted commanders were “underground underneath a residential building in the heart of the Dahiyeh neighborhood, using civilians as a human shield” at the time of the attack. In total, Hezbollah confirmed the deaths of at least 16 of its operatives in the strike, which flattened a multistory residential building and was the deadliest strike between Israel and Lebanon since the October 7 attacks. The Lebanese health minister, Firass Abiad, said at a news conference Saturday that among the 31 dead are three children and seven women. Three Syrian citizens were killed, he said, and 68 people wounded. Rescue teams were still clearing the rubble Saturday, Abiad said, and searching for missing people. They had retrieved body parts that are unidentifiable. A week of surprise attacks Friday’s strike marked the fourth consecutive day of surprise attacks on Beirut and other sites across the country, even as Israeli forces continued deadly strikes and operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The first major attack against Hezbollah this week came Tuesday afternoon when pagers belonging to the militant groups’ members exploded near-simultaneously. The pagers had been used by Hezbollah to communicate after the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, encouraged members to switch to low-tech devices to prevent more of them from being assassinated. Almost exactly 24 hours later, Lebanon was rocked by a second wave of explosions, after Hezbollah walkie-talkies detonated in Beirut and the south of the country on Wednesday. Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad on Saturday said at least 39 people were killed in those twin attacks; 12 on Tuesday and 27 on Wednesday. Some 3,000 were injured. In a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, UN human rights chief Volker Türk on Friday warned that the detonation of communication devices could violate international human rights law. Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib and Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon clashed at the heated meeting, with Bou Habib calling on the council to condemn Israel’s actions and Danon slamming the Lebanese envoy for not mentioning Hezbollah. A photo taken in southern Beirut shows the remains of an exploded pager on Tuesday. AFP/Getty Images Israel initially refused to comment on Tuesday’s pager explosions, but on Wednesday tacitly acknowledged its role in the attacks. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant praised the “excellent achievements” of the IDF, together with the country’s security agency, the Shin Bet, and its intelligence agency Mossad. Gallant said a “new era” of war was beginning, and on Thursday Israel targeted Beirut for a third time, flying jets and dropping flares over the city while Nasrallah made a speech in which he pledged Israel would face a “reckoning.” Later, Israel launched one of its most intense bombardments against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in nearly a year of cross–border strikes, saying it hit about 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers. Friday’s airstrike was the third Israeli airstrike on Beirut since hostilities began last year, after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. In January, an Israeli airstrike killed Saleh Al-Arouri , deputy head of Hamas’ military wing, who had been living in Beirut. In July, a second Israeli strike on Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr . Several other Iran-backed militant groups, including the powerful Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba in Iraq have vowed revenge for Israel’s attack on southern Beirut. The groups have carried out several attacks against US forces in Iraq and Israel since Israel’s war with Hamas started. Ibrahim Aqil, pictured here on a wanted poster, had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States.

After nearly a year of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes both in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. While the return of residents of northern Israel has long been understood to be a political necessity for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal.

Eden Yerushalmi was taken from the Nova music festival when Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel, and her body was among six recovered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late last month. Her sisters Shani and May told CNN’s Anderson Cooper they had received proof that she was alive on three occasions, including just three weeks before her death. “It’s very difficult for us. We feel like we’re in a nightmare,” Shani Yerushalmi said. “Sometimes it feels like it isn’t real, like it’s not happening to us, because the whole time we truly believed that Eden would come back home alive.” Yerushalmi’s family have learned details of her captivity from the IDF since her body was returned to Israel from Gaza. Describing the tunnel in which she was kept for several weeks, Shani said: “They barely could stand fully … they couldn’t sleep next to each other, only in a line. There were no windows, no air, no light. Barely food, and if they needed to go to the bathroom they were forced to do it in a bucket.” The IDF said the group’s bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The IDF told the family her sister was “shot in the head from very close range,” and had marks on her hands from defending herself, May told CNN. Yerushalmi’s death, along with five other Israeli captives, ignited fresh rage in the country , much of it directed at the handling of the crisis by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Netanyahu has been under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire-for-hostages deal that would secure the return of more than 100 people still held in the enclave. “In that specific tunnel we know that they were a few weeks, which is horrible. I don’t know if I could be in there a day,” Shani told CNN. Yerushalmi, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Carmel Gat, was slated to be released as part of the “humanitarian category” based on a framework deal Israel and Hamas agreed to in early July, two Israeli officials told CNN after the recovery of their bodies, with one of them adding : “Our prime minister delayed it.” The 23-year-old from Tel Aviv was a pilates instructor and working as a bartender at the Nova music festival on October 7. When sirens sounded, Yerushalmi sent a video of rocket fire to her family group chat, saying she was leaving the festival, according to the Hostages Families Forum. For four hours, she spoke with her two sisters, May and Shani, who heard everything she went through as she tried to escape. Her last words were: “They’ve caught me.” May, who chose to see Yerushalmi’s body after its return to Israel, told CNN: “We gave her a last hug to say goodbye to her. She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out.” Her autopsy later showed she was just 79 pounds when she died. The sisters described Yerushalmi as a friendly and warm person, with May saying: “The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.”"

Focus is now on what Hezbollah and Israel’s next moves will be, with the United Nations Security Council due to hold an emergency meeting Friday to discuss the situation. Uncertainty remains over whether Israel’s attacks are a precursor to a ground invasion across its northern border into Lebanon and to what extent Iran-backed Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the region, is capable of responding even as its leader vowed that a “reckoning will come.” Here’s what we know. What’s the fallout? In Lebanon, fear and panic have gripped residents as the attacks upended daily life to deadly and gruesome effect. A surgeon told CNN there is a long road to recovery for many of those maimed or in critical condition after wireless devices exploded in their pockets or faces. At least 37 people were killed in the attacks Tuesday and Wednesday, including children, and nearly 3,000 injured. Hezbollah said at least 38 of its members have been killed since Tuesday afternoon, but didn’t provide further details. In a speech Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned the twin attacks, calling them “massacres” that “crossed all the red lines” because the devices exploded in public areas, with civilians among those harmed. Though Hezbollah “suffered a major blow,” a “reckoning will come,” he added, and vowed the attacks would not bring the group down. The Hezbollah chief also warned Israel that fighting on the Lebanese front will not stop until hostilities end in Gaza .

Hours later, Israel launched a barrage of strikes in Lebanon, saying it hit about 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and “terrorist infrastructure sites.” Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it launched at least 17 attacks on military sites in northern Israel. Israel has signaled its readiness for war with Hezbollah. The Israeli defense minister’s warning on Wednesday that a “new era” of war was beginning was followed by the military confirming its top commander had “completed approval of plans for the northern arena” along the Lebanon border.

Hezbollah leader Nasrallah hinted at retaliation for the twin attacks but it’s unclear what capacity the group might have to launch a counterattack if many of its members are wounded, and key communication methods are no longer reliable. Despite Hezbollah appearing weakened, it is still believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world with an increasingly sophisticated arsenal that has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel. There are however signs the already secretive group may have been driven deeper underground. The usual public gathering – typically consisting of high-level party officials and supporters – to watch Nasrallah’s speech was absent on Thursday. And Nasrallah’s address – his first since the two waves of attacks – was possibly pre-recorded.

Lebanon-based Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led axis spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 11 months. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami reportedly told Nasrallah that Israel “will soon” face “a decisive and crushing response from (the) axis of resistance.” The group also has a history of targeting Israel overseas, including a 1992 bomb attack at the Israeli embassy in Argentina that killed 29 people, and attacks on Israeli diplomats in India, Georgia and Thailand in 2012 that Israel blamed on Iran and Hezbollah , though the group denied involvement at the time.

Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Haven’t we been here before? Fears that Israel’s devastating war in Gaza could spill into a wider regional conflict have flared to varying degrees of alarm since Hamas launched its deadly October 7 killing and kidnapping rampage. Key players have at times appeared to walk right up to the brink , but tensions have de-escalated given the grave consequences of an all-out war in the Middle East. But almost every week brings another violent incident that sets the region on high alert once again, with fears that an all out war would drag in the entire region, as well as Israel’s chief ally the United States.

Alexander sat down with Tapper along with other family members of Americans being held by the terror group on Wednesday as the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s brutal October 7 attack approaches. As it stands the prospects of a deal being agreed that would free the hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza seem remote. Instead, the conflict appears to be spreading. On Thursday Israel launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and on Wednesday Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated  a “new era” of war is beginning. On the ceasefire negotiations, Alexander called for President Joe Biden to “have a tight conversation” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him to “stop moving the goalposts and stop undercutting your own negotiating team.” “This conversation needs to happen as soon as possible,” he added. Netanyahu is scheduled to be in New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly, but a source told CNN that he will not meet with Biden. Biden has previously suggested that Netanyahu is drawing out the conflict for the sake of his own political survival. Iris Weinstein Haggai, whose parents were killed on October 7, said the US government needs to do more. “It’s just unacceptable that we’re not doing all we can to push all countries and [the] international community to pressure Hamas and release these innocent hostages who are rotting,” Weinstein Haggai said. Several of the hostage families are in Washington this week, just under three weeks from the anniversary of the October 7 attacks. The families met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday, where they “expressed frustration with the lack of tangible progress” in ceasefire talks, according to a readout of their meeting. Their visit comes weeks after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, from Hamas-controlled tunnels in Gaza. Days before Goldberg-Polin’s death was confirmed, his parents made a plea for their son’s return at the Democratic National Convention. Ronen Neutra, the father of Omer Neutra, said on Wednesday he was “horrified” by Goldberg-Polin’s death. “Where is the outrage? How can it be that an American was murdered, and yet people are in the streets in New York cheering for Hamas? It’s the same organization (that) just killed an American,” he said. “So in that regard, where is the outrage? “As far as Prime Minister Netanyahu? I don’t think I have much expectations from him I’m afraid,” Neutra added. “What he says out of Israel in front of the American public and what he says in Israel that those two don’t correlate.” Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of another American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said his expectations for a breakthrough in negotiations “are low.” “All Israelis are done listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu because clearly there’s a gap between what he says in terms of his commitment to getting the hostages home and his actions,” Dekel-Chen added. “It’s clear to me, at least that he’s coming to the United Nations certainly for domestic consumption in Israel,” he said. “What he says there, I’m not sure that anyone is going to be listening unfortunately in the General Assembly.” “It’s just unacceptable that we’re not doing all we can to push all countries and [the] international community to pressure Hamas and release these innocent hostages who are rotting,” he said.

The proposal from Gal Hirsch, a close Netanyahu ally who serves as Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, would see a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza , the release in one stage of all hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the safe passage for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to be exiled out of Gaza, according to Kan 11, an Israeli national broadcaster and CNN affiliate. Reactions to the proposal have widely been that it will be a non-starter for Hamas, which has not commented on it. President Joe Biden announces a proposed ceasefire between Israel and Hamas while delivering remarks at the White House on May 31, 2024. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Related article Biden’s national security team has no imminent plans to present an updated ceasefire proposal It is unclear whether the proposal addresses the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza after a ceasefire and hostage deal – a key sticking point in stalled negotiations. And the idea that Sinwar would leave Gaza is seen as unlikely by American officials. A separate Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said the proposal was not being discussed among the Israeli negotiating team as a basis for new negotiations with Hamas, which have been at a standstill for weeks now. The Hostages Families Forum initially praised the outline, but later on Thursday called it a “cynical and cheap manipulation.” “This is fraud whose purpose is to thwart the new American initiative to release the hostages and stop the war in Gaza,” the organization said. “Soon we will celebrate a year of abandonment. This is a moral and value bankruptcy that the state has never seen before.” Talks stall The proposal comes at a time when the prospects for a deal have never been lower. The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have expressed dismay at escalating tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying that a widescale war there would only lower the chances of a hostage deal. Joe Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present the US president with an updated proposal in the Israel-Hamas war ceasefire negotiations, two senior administration officials told CNN – the latest indication that talks to end the conflict have seriously stalled. Netanyahu will not meet with Biden during his visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly next week, an Israel source familiar with the matter told CNN. Hirsch met early last week with Roger Carstens, the US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, to discuss negotiations to free the hostages held in Gaza. The notion of facilitating Sinwar’s exile has been discussed at various points in the negotiations as part of the later stages of an eventual ceasefire agreement, although there is no indication that Sinwar would agree to such terms. Gershon Baskin, who has extensive experience negotiating with Hamas, told CNN that anyone who thought Sinwar would leave Gaza “does not live in this world.” “Gaza is Sinwar’s sea and he is a fish. A fish does not come out of the sea willingly.” Nonetheless, if the agreement included the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, it would come “close to a deal that Hamas is ready for,” Baskin added. Previously, when the idea was raised of allowing top Hamas leaders like Sinwar to leave Gaza as part of a ceasefire agreement, American officials said they thought it was unlikely Sinwar would agree. They cited Israel’s assassinations of Hamas leaders in foreign capitals, and said they believed Sinwar would prefer to die fighting Israel than to leave Gaza. “I even believe that we will agree to build safe passage to the chief terrorist, the new Hitler, Sinwar – safe passage to him and whoever he wants to join him out of Gaza,” Hirsch told CNN earlier this month.

Here’s what we know,"Lebanon is reeling after facing deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members – with pagers simultaneously exploding across the country on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion on Wednesday.","Sep 19, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Jessie Yeung,Middle East,"CNN — Lebanon is reeling after facing deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members – with pagers simultaneously exploding across the country on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion on Wednesday. Panic, fear and grief have now gripped the country, with questions swirling about how the attacks could have been carried out, where the devices came from, and whether this latest development could plunge the Middle East into a wider regional conflict. At least 37 people, including children, have been killed in the attacks, which Lebanese officials have blamed on Israel . Thousands more are injured – many maimed and in critical condition after communications devices exploded in their pockets or in their face. After warning Wednesday that a “new era” of war was beginning, Israel on Thursday began to strike targets in Lebanon and says its top commander has approved plans “for the northern arena.” Here’s what we know so far. What happened, when and where? The first attack came on Tuesday afternoon when pagers exploded at the same time across several parts of Lebanon – including the capital Beirut, and in several towns in the central Beqaa valley, strongholds for the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Videos showed the bloody aftermath on streets and public spaces. In one CCTV video, a man was picking out fruit in a supermarket when an explosion detonated – leaving him groaning in pain on the ground, clutching his lower abdomen as panic breaks out around him. Lebanese hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, with limited staff attending to hundreds of bandaged and bleeding patients – some of whom had to lie on the floor as more of the injured arrived. Almost exactly 24 hours later, Lebanon was rocked by a second attack Wednesday, when walkie-talkies detonated in the suburbs of Beirut and in the south of the country. One witness, who cannot be named for security reasons, described seeing a man’s hands blown off by an exploding walkie-talkie while attending a Hezbollah funeral. Fires broke out in dozens of homes, stores, and vehicles, with videos showing smoke billowing on chaotic streets. In a speech on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah conceded the group had suffered an “unprecedented” blow. He said the twin attacks had “crossed all red lines” and pledged there would be a “reckoning.” While Nasrallah was speaking, CNN reporters in the country heard a sonic boom as an Israeli military jet flew over Beirut and dropped what appeared to be flares over the city. Minutes later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it was striking targets to “degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure.” Firefighters put out flames and a crowd gathers after a reported explosion in Saida, Lebanon, on September 18, 2024. Mahmoud Zayat/AFP/Getty Images Why would Israel target Lebanon now? Hezbollah and Israel have been at conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October when the war in Gaza began, following Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel. Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the Middle East spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 11 months. The axis has said they will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader. Israel may have chosen this timing for the attacks because it believed Hezbollah had discovered the pagers’ capability – making it a “use it or lose it” moment, said an Israeli source familiar with national security. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also have wanted to shore up domestic support. Officials and residents from the northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes after being evacuated due to attacks, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border – which has long been understood to be a political necessity. People gather outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which saw an influx of injured patients after explosions in Lebanon's capital on September 17. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters How did it happen? There are still many questions on how Israel might have carried out its attacks this week – and where the devices that detonated came from. Hezbollah is highly secretive, and its leader has previously urged families to dump their cell phones to avoid infiltration from Israeli and US spyware. That’s why so many Hezbollah members and their families rely instead on low-tech wireless communication devices like pagers. The pagers that exploded were new and had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, a Lebanese security source told CNN. The New York Times reported that Israel planted explosives next to the battery in each pager, as well as a switch for remote detonation, citing US and other officials. When CNN tried to trace the pagers’ origin, it found a mysterious supply chain that stretched from Asia to Europe. Damaged pagers in Lebanon bore the name of a Taiwanese manufacturer – but the company said the devices were instead made and sold by a Hungarian company in Budapest. Hungarian authorities denied this, however, saying the Budapest firm was a “trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country. CNN has tried to contact the company and its chief executive, but did not receive a response. However, according to NBC News, the chief executive confirmed in a phone call that her company worked with the Taiwanese manufacturer – but denied making the pagers and said she was just “the intermediate.” CNN could not confirm her statement. Making things even stranger, the address for the company’s office is in a residential area – where other people in the building said they hardly saw people coming to work, and that the Budapest company had never physically been to the building. Late Thursday, The New York Times reported that the Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, was in fact part of an Israeli front, citing three intelligence officers briefed on the matter. The firm was one of at least three shell companies created to mask the fact that Israeli intelligence personnel were manufacturing the pagers, the officers told the Times. Meanwhile, Lebanon said the walkie-talkies that exploded were a discontinued model made by Japanese firm ICOM. The devices were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, Lebanese authorities said. ICOM said the model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether the ones used in Lebanon were counterfeit or shipped from its company. A photo taken Wednesday in Beirut shows the remains of an exploded pager. AFP/Getty Images How have Hezbollah, Israel and the world responded? Nasrallah said Israel will face a “reckoning” for its twin “massacres.” The head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, told Nasrallah that Israel will face a “crushing response,” Iran state media IRNA reported. The Lebanese government also condemned the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression” and a violation of their national sovereignty. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN on Wednesday he fears the consecutive attacks in Lebanon signal a move to an “introduction to war,” calling on the United Nations Security Council and the United States to help re-establish peace along the Lebanon-Israel border.

After the IDF strikes began on Thursday, Gallant said : “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price.” It appears US officials were largely in the dark until reports emerged of the explosions, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Israeli officials notified the US that it was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon on Tuesday but did not give any details about what they were planning, the sources said.

Almost exactly 24 hours later, walkie-talkies detonated in a fresh wave of explosions Wednesday across Lebanon, a security source told CNN. The suspected attacks against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah are the latest in a series of covert operations that Israel’s government refuses to acknowledge but which are alleged to have been carried out by Israeli operatives. Munich massacre response CNN video Related video Israel’s history of brazen clandestine missions Israel’s alleged history of planting explosives in telecommunication devices goes back as far as 1972, as part of its revenge for the killing of 11 Israelis, including athletes, at the Munich Olympics, which was carried out by the Palestinian militant group Black September. In response, Israel launched “Operation Wrath of God” and spent years tracking down those involved in the Munich Massacre. Mahmoud Hamshari, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representative in Paris, was among those targeted. Unidentified operatives reported to be linked to Israeli intelligence broke into his home and planted a bomb in his phone, before another person – posing as an Italian journalist – arranged a telephone interview with Hamshari. When he picked up the call and identified himself, the bomb was activated remotely. The ‘engineer’ Tuesday’s attacks reminded many of the 1996 killing of Yahya Ayyash , Hamas’ chief bombmaker known as “the engineer,” responsible for killing dozens of Israelis. Ayyash was killed in Gaza after his cell phone, which had been packed with 50 grams (1.76 ounces) of explosives, blew up near his head. After his killing, dozens of Israelis were killed in four retaliatory suicide bombings. Firefighters try to put out a blaze after an explosion in Saida, southern Lebanon, on Wednesday. Mahmoud Zayat/AFP/Getty Images Iranian nuclear scientists Since 2010, five Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in foreign-linked assassinations, as Israel tries to prevent its greatest adversary from developing nuclear weapons. In August 2015, at the height of the assassinations, then-Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon cryptically told the German magazine Der Spiegel that he could not be held responsible “for the life expectancy of Iranian scientists.” Experts believe Israel and the United States were responsible for deploying the complex computer virus called Stuxnet that destroyed centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. Iranian officials have said they believe the cyberattack, which targeted centrifuges including those at the Natanz and Bushehr nuclear plants, originated in Israel and the United States, but neither country has commented on the malware’s origin. Notably, Stuxnet was one of the first times a cyberattack had a manifestation outside cyberspace, causing the centrifuges to spin out of control unnoticed. The pager attack is seemingly another instance of a cyberattack causing a physical consequence, unlike stealing money from a bank account or taking down a website. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , who was Iran’s chief nuclear scientist, was assassinated east of Tehran in 2020 by a remote-controlled machine gun operating out of a nearby Nissan. Iranian officials said the weapon had used artificial intelligence and facial recognition to detect Fakhrizadeh and open fire, before the car, reportedly packed with explosives, self-destructed. Top Iranian officials blamed Israel for the assassination. Israel did not comment. Military personnel carry Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's flag-draped coffin in Tehran in November 2020. Iranian Defense Ministry/AP Human intelligence While many of these assassinations have a sci-fi aspect, experts stressed that each operation requires high levels of human intelligence that raised questions about the security protocols of Israel’s adversaries. After Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, intelligence analysts stressed that a country or actor would still have had to smuggle in specialist equipment to stage the operation. After this week’s events, some speculated that the explosions could have been caused by an Israeli cybersecurity breach that caused the lithium batteries in the pagers to overheat and detonate. But David Kennedy, a former US National Security Agency intelligence analyst, told CNN the explosions were “too large for this to be a remote and direct hack that would overload the pager and cause a lithium battery explosion.” A person is carried on a stretcher outside American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) as people, including Hezbollah fighters and medics, were wounded and killed when the pagers they use to communicate exploded across Lebanon, according to a security source, in Beirut, Lebanon September 17, 2024. REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Related article Hezbollah’s credibility depends on revenge against Israel. But its weakness has been exposed Kennedy said it was more likely that Israel had human operatives in Hezbollah who were able to intercept the supply chain and tamper with the devices. “The pagers would have been implanted with explosives and likely only to detonate when a certain message was received,” he said. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel had hidden explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah, and that a switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, according to unnamed American and other officials briefed on the operation. In some instances, Israel is thought to have relied on human intelligence assets to assassinate its enemies rather than high-tech operations. In July, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran by an explosive device that had been covertly hidden in the guest house where he was staying, two months before it was detonated, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. However, Iran claimed that Haniyeh’s assassination was carried out by a “short-range projectile,” contradicting the information told to CNN. The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.

Almost exactly 24 hours after explosions targeting the pagers of Hezbollah members killed multiple people, including children, and injured more than 2,800, Lebanon was rocked by more deadly blasts as walkie-talkies detonated in Beirut and the south of the country. At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 injured in Wednesday’s explosions, Lebanon’s health ministry said. After declining to comment on Tuesday’s blasts, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant appeared to reference the attacks during a visit Wednesday to the Ramat-David Air Force base in northern Israel. CNN video Related video ‘This will end up with a regional war,’ warns Lebanese Foreign Minister “We are at the beginning of a new era in this war and we need to adapt ourselves,” Gallant said. He praised the “excellent achievements” of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), together with the country’s security agency, the Shin Bet, and its intelligence agency Mossad. CNN previously reported that Tuesday’s operation was a joint effort between the IDF and Mossad, but Gallant’s comment is the first time an Israeli official has apparently acknowledged Israel’s role in the twin attacks. An Israeli source familiar with national security later told CNN Israel launched the pager attack in a “use it or lose it” moment when it believed Hezbollah discovered the capability. The pager explosions came hours after Israel on Monday voted to add another war objective to its conflict with Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to their homes. After nearly a year of tit-for-tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. While the return of Israeli residents has long been understood to be a political necessity for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal. On Wednesday, Netanyahu reiterated his pledge to “bring back the residents of the north safely to their homes.” A source familiar with the matter told CNN the IDF is moving the elite 98th Division from Gaza to northern Israel. “The center of gravity is moving north,” Gallant said. “The meaning is that we are diverting forces, resources, energy towards the north.” Smoke rises from a mobile shop in Sidon, south of Beirut, on Wednesday. Hassan Hankir/Reuters Fresh wave of strikes Dozens of ambulance crews from the Lebanese Red Cross were working to rescue and evacuate the injured after walkie-talkies exploded across the country Wednesday. A witness who was at a Hezbollah funeral in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Wednesday described the chaos as walkie-talkies appeared to explode at around 5 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET). The witness, who cannot be named for security reasons, told CNN they heard a loud bang followed by screaming. They said the man whose wireless device exploded was covered in blood and his hands had been blown off. Photos meanwhile show﻿ed walkie-talkies that were ripped apart in the explosions. The Lebanese Civil Defense said it was working to put out fires in 60 homes and shops that started after the walkie-talkies exploded, including one in a lithium battery store. Lebanon’s communications ministry said the walkie-talkies were a discontinued model made by Japanese firm ICOM. The IC-V82 devices were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, the ministry said. ICOM said in a statement Wednesday it was investigating the reports and that the model linked to the explosions was discontinued a decade ago. ICOM added it could not determine whether they were counterfeit or shipped by the company, though its website says all such IC-V82 devices in circulation are counterfeit. Two damaged devices after Wednesday's explosions. Obtained by CNN Hezbollah on Tuesday vowed to respond to the Israeli pager attacks that killed at least 12 people and injured thousands across Lebanon. At least two children were killed in those blasts, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said. United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the pager attacks were a violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the use of booby traps – objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use – and called for an “independent, thorough and transparent investigation.” Speculation has mounted over how low-tech wireless communication devices could have been exploited, as well as the origins of those devices and a mysterious supply chain stretching from Taiwan to Hungary. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah. A switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, it added. But Gold Apollo denied making the pagers bearing its brand name, and pointed to a Budapest-registered distributor as the manufacturer. Hungarian authorities denied Gold Apollo’s suggestion, saying that BAC Consulting “is a trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country. Fears of escalation The twin attacks in Lebanon risk further escalating tensions in the region already heightened over Israel’s war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged parties to avert any further escalation. The UN chief said the “logic” of making all the devices explode was that of a “pre-emptive strike before a major military operation.” Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN he fears the consecutive attacks signal a move to an “introduction to war.” “It’s a scary moment and we are afraid (of) coming to war, because we don’t want a war,” said the foreign minister, calling on the UN Security Council and the United States to help re-establish peace along the Lebanon-Israel border. CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer also suggested Israel’s disruption of Hezbollah’s communications network could pave the way for an imminent military offensive in Lebanon. “The fact that Israel got into their supply network is unprecedented,” Baer said, highlighting the disruption of Hezbollah’s use of walkie-talkies as particularly damaging because the group relies on them to call in fire coordinates, move ammunition and communicate in real time. This leaves Hezbollah vulnerable if Israel moves forward with its military plans. This is a developing story and will be updated.

The fact no details about the operation were given meant US officials were in the dark until reports of hundreds of exploding pagers emerged a short time later, the sources said. CNN has learned that Israel was behind the audacious attack, which has heightened tensions in a region already on edge even further, and it was a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad and the Israeli military. The Lebanese government condemned the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression.” At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 were injured, according to health officials in Lebanon, on Wednesday after walkie-talkies detonated in a fresh wave of explosions , one day after the pager blasts killed at least 12 people. Tuesday’s explosions came as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was traveling from Washington to Cairo on Tuesday, stunning US diplomats who watched the breaking news in real time on their airplane TVs. It wasn’t the first time that Israel has taken provocative action around the same time Blinken was on a visit to the Middle East. But this specific action triggered concerns about regional escalation that the US has long been trying to avoid. Blinken said the US “did not know about nor was it involved in these incidents.” The US conveyed to Iran via a back channel that they were not involved in the attack and that Iran should not escalate, a separate US official told CNN. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was injured by the exploding pagers, according to Iranian state media. Throughout the course of the nearly year-long war in Gaza, the US has consistently sent indirect messages to Tehran about not escalating. Gallant and Austin spoke a second time later Tuesday after it became clear thousands of Hezbollah members were wounded by exploding pagers, but officials declined to go into what was discussed. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that “the US was not involved” and was “not aware of this incident that hundreds of pagers … were going to explode in Lebanon ahead of time.” Jean-Pierre’s wording was precise in that the US was not told about specifically about exploding pagers in advance. The notification from Israel was far more generic and vague, leaving US officials with questions about what the operation could be, the sources said. Since Hamas’ October 7 attack, Israel has regularly carried out strikes in Lebanon in response to the launch of Hezbollah drones and missiles. Israel has also targeted senior Hamas officials in Lebanon. The breadth of Israeli operations in Lebanon over the past 11 months added to the questions about what Israel could be planning.

The resolution was adopted in the UN General Assembly after receiving 124 votes in favor. Fourteen countries voted against, including the United States, Hungary, Israel, Argentina, Czechia, Fiji, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Forty-three nations abstained from the vote. The vote comes after the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice, said in July that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal and called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories claimed by Palestinians for a future state. In its advisory opinion, the ICJ said Israel should end its occupation “as rapidly as possible.” The UN’s resolution gives a 12-month timeline. Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the UN, called the vote a turning point “in our struggle for freedom and justice.” The resolution was put forward by observer state Palestine, which was granted new privileges – including the right to submit proposals in the assembly – in May. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, meanwhile slammed the vote outcome as “a a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.” Neither the ICJ advisory opinion nor the assembly resolution are binding, however the two decisions could further isolate Israel as world leaders prepare to meet next week in New York for the annual UN General Assembly. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas are expected to address other world leaders at the UN on September 26. Monitoring group Human Rights Watch (HRW) welcomed Wednesday’s resolution. “Israel should immediately heed the demand of an overwhelming majority of UN member states to abide by the World Court’s historic ruling on Israel’s decades-long occupation,” Louis Charbonneau, UN director at HRW, said in a statement. Amnesty International also welcomed the resolution and called on Israel to abide by it. “This resolution vindicates long-standing calls from the Palestinian people and many countries around the world, by pursuing the implementation of the ICJ’s historic advisory opinion which confirmed Israel has a legal obligation to end its unlawful occupation of the OPT and its systemic discrimination against the occupied Palestinian population,” said Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said. During the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan heights from neighboring Arab states. Soon after, it began establishing Jewish settlements in these territories. The Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza for a future state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel considers the entirety of Jerusalem as its “eternal capital.”"

Comedian Chelsea Handler, actress Connie Britton and Bravo’s Andy Cohen are among those who have signed the letter, which asks Biden and Harris to “protect and support” Israel amid the ongoing war between the country and Hamas. “We are artists who want sustainable peace in the Middle East and recognize that the first essential step towards that peace is Hamas returning the 101 remaining hostages,” the letter, reported first by CNN, states. It comes weeks after six Israeli hostages , including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were killed by Hamas . The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the hostages’ bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The remaining hostages have been held for nearly a year, since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Among the other signatories are actors Mayim Bialik, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca Gayheart and Patricia Heaton; reality TV personalities Jill Zarin, Margaret Joseph and “The Bachelor” alum Colton Underwood; and social media influencers such as Ariel Martin, better known as Baby Ariel on TikTok, where she has over 36 million followers, and dancer Montana Tucker, who has nearly 10 million followers on TikTok. The letter, which is signed by both Jewish and non-Jewish performers and artists, was organized by four Jewish advocacy groups: StopAntisemitism, End Jew Hatred, 2024 New Voices and StandWithUs. “We are approaching one year since 251 hostages were brutally stolen from their lives and 1200 were murdered. It is so important to keep the spotlight on this,” 2024 New Voices founder Samantha Ettus told CNN. “Our celebrities have come together to draw attention to the 101 hostages remaining in Gaza, including five Americans. After the brutal execution of six hostages, the urgency of getting the world to talk about this is now. We need to put as much pressure as possible on Hamas to return the hostages.” Hersh Goldberg-Polin Courtesy Goldberg-Polin family video Related video Remembering slain Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin Earlier this month, US officials told CNN that doubts have been raised within the White House about whether the Israel-Hamas war can come to an end before Biden leaves office. According to a Human Rights Watch report released this summer , Hamas-led armed groups committed “numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity” that were “directed against a civilian population” in which “killing civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.” The US response to the Israel-Hamas war has divided some in the entertainment industry. Two weeks ago, a group of Hollywood stars, including Ariana Grande, Ben Affleck, Mahershala Ali, Cate Blanchett, Drake, Dua Lipa, Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Mark Ruffalo, signed their names on a new Artists4Ceasefire letter, which called on the US to halt arms sales to Israel. “Beyond our pain and mourning for all of the people there and their loved ones around the world we are motivated by an unbending will to stand for our common humanity,” the Artists4Ceasefire letter states. “We stand for freedom, justice, dignity and peace for all people – and a deep desire to stop more bloodshed.” The full 2024 New Voices letter can be found here ."

But its weakness has been exposed,"For years Hezbollah was seen as the world’s premiere non-state actor: the well-equipped, well-trained, well-led, highly disciplined and secretive jewel in the crown of Iran’s allies across the Middle East.","Sep 18, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Ben Wedeman,Middle East,"Beirut, Lebanon CNN — For years Hezbollah was seen as the world’s premier non-state actor: the well-equipped, well-trained, well-led, highly disciplined and secretive jewel in the crown of Iran’s allies across the Middle East. In May 2000, the group managed to drive Israel out of southern Lebanon after a grueling guerilla conflict. Six years later, it fought Israel to a standstill in a 34-day war. Since then, the Iranian-backed group has built up its arsenal of missiles and drones. In Syria, its troops fought alongside Iran and Russia against the opposition to the Assad regime. For the past 11 months, Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israel along the border almost daily, forcing more than 62,000 Israelis to flee their homes in the north of the Jewish state (while more than 100,000 Lebanese have fled the border area). But this summer, the façade of strength began to slip. On the evening of July 30, an Israeli drone fired two missiles into a residential building in southern Beirut, killing senior Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr. And on Tuesday, at approximately 3:30 p.m. Beirut time, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pagers exploded across areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, wounding almost 3,000 people and killing at least 12. On Wednesday afternoon, a fresh wave of explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs and towns in the south of the country, killing at least nine people, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Many of the devices that detonated were walkie-talkies, images showed. While Hezbollah has yet to release precise numbers, it’s clear many of its rank and file were injured in the explosions. Taken together, the missile attack and the exploding devices represent a dramatic infiltration by Israel of Hezbollah’s critical command and control networks. Never has the group been so vulnerable, never has it been so compromised. Hezbollah has vowed to take revenge on Israel. Its credibility depends on it. But realistically, what can it do? Not much, its recent track record suggests. To avenge Shukr’s killing, on August 25 Hezbollah launched more than 300 drones and missiles at targets in Israel, including, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claimed, the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency and Unit 8200, Israel’s signals intelligence unit. Israel denied any important targets were struck and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial. Most of the people who carried the devices that exploded were probably field officers, the local linchpins for cells of fighters who make up the backbone of Hezbollah’s forces. And now perhaps two thousand, or more, have been temporarily knocked out of commission, or worse. The communications network of which the pagers and walkie-talkies were a key part is almost certainly offline. Hezbollah’s intelligence officers must be desperately trying to figure out how all this happened. Even if a decision is taken to retaliate against Israel, how will the order be passed down the line, and who will – or even can – carry it out? Already the border conflict has come at a high cost to Hezbollah, which concedes it has lost more than 400 fighters since October last year, compared with around 250 killed in the far more intense 34-day war with Israel in 2006. An ambulance drives through a southern suburb of Beirut after explosions were heard. Bilal Hussein/AP Related article Dozens of walkie-talkies explode in Lebanon one day after pager blasts injure thousands, state media reports Hezbollah continues to put on a brave face, vowing to carry on striking Israeli targets as long the war in Gaza goes on. “Morale is high, and the injured will return to the front,” a man who described himself as a “Hezbollah supporter” told CNN as he waited for news of a wounded friend being treated in hospital. Hezbollah is in a corner. Israel is no longer willing to tolerate the slow-burn war on its northern border and is resorting to ever more extreme and potentially escalatory measures. There is little Hezbollah can do to stop Israel, or to retaliate."

A child was among at least nine killed in the blasts, which wounded about 2,800 people, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said. At least 170 people are in a critical condition, he said, though the nature of the other injuries is unclear. The attack underscores Hezbollah’s vulnerability as its communication network was compromised to deadly effect and follows a series of targeted assassinations against its commanders. Meanwhile, dozens of walkie talkies exploded in Lebanon on Wednesday, leaving at least one person dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry, which said the affected devices belonged to Hamas members. The incidents risk further escalating tensions in the Middle East already heightened over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. CNN has learned Tuesday’s explosions were the result of a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. While the Israeli military has said it will not comment on the explosions, both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed it for the attack. Iran also blamed what it referred to as “Israeli terrorism.” Speculation has mounted over how low-tech wireless communication devices could have been exploited. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah. A switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, it added. Gold Apollo’s founder and chairperson told reporters Wednesday that the pagers used in the attack were made by a European distributor. Hsu Ching-kuang said his firm had signed a contract with the distributor to use the Gold Apollo brand. Videos circulating on social media and news agencies appear to show powerful explosions in locations across Lebanon. In one CCTV video, a man is seen picking out fruit in a supermarket when an explosion tears his bag to shreds. Bystanders run after hearing the blast, while the man drops to the ground clutching his lower abdomen. After several seconds, he can be heard groaning in pain. Other social media videos showed large numbers of injured people, including at least one child. Those wounded were covered in blood, many with facial and hand injuries.

It later said that its operations against Israel would continue and vowed “hard atonement awaiting the criminal enemy for the massacre it committed Tuesday.” The militant group had earlier confirmed on its Telegram channel that “workers” in various Hezbollah institutions were affected by the explosions, with a “large number” of people injured. Hezbollah has long touted secrecy as a cornerstone of its military strategy, forgoing high-tech devices to avoid infiltration from Israeli and US spyware. Unlike other non-state actors in the Middle East, Hezbollah units are believed to communicate through an internal communications network. This is considered one of the key building blocks of the powerful group that has long been accused of operating as a state-within-a-state. Iran’s Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those wounded in Beirut Tuesday, along with two embassy employees, according to Iranian state media. Amani has a superficial injury and is under observation in the hospital, state media IRNA reported, citing his wife. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati slammed Tuesday’sattack as “a serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards” in a cabinet meeting Tuesday, according to the state-run NNA news outlet. The Israeli military, which has engaged in tit-for-tat strikes with Hezbollah since the start of the war in Gaza last October, said in a statement following the pagerexplosions that it had no change in its advice to Israeli civilians. “The public are asked to remain alert and vigilant, and any change in policy will be updated immediately,” it said in a statement. Police officers inspect a car in which a pager exploded. Hussein Malla/AP Explosives placed in pagers The wave of explosions affected several areas in Lebanon, particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, according to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces. NNA reported that “hacked” pager devices exploded in the towns of Ali Al-Nahri and Riyaq in the central Beqaa valley, resulting in a significant number of injuries. The locations are Hezbollah strongholds. Israel placed explosive material in a batch of Taiwanese-made pagers imported into Lebanon and destined for Hezbollah, The New York Times reported, citing American and other officials briefed on the operation. The explosives were planted next to the battery in each pager, and a switch embedded to detonate them remotely, according to The New York Times. CNN previously reported that the pagers that exploded had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, according to a Lebanese security source. The devices detonated simultaneously after receiving a message on Tuesday afternoon. Multiple photos from Lebanon on social media appear to show damaged Gold Apollo pagers. CNN cannot geolocate the images from social media but has verified they were published on Tuesday, the same day as the explosions. At least one pager shown in the images was a Gold Apollo AR924 model. Eyewitnesses described the carnage in Beirut following the blasts. “We were surprised that there were a lot of people … there was blood on the roads and people were being transported in ambulances to the hospital. But we did not know what was happening,” said one witness, who did not want to be named for safety reasons. The witness told CNN he went to a hospital to visit a friend who had been carrying one of the pagers when it exploded. “This device was not only in the hands of people who belong to [Hezbollah], but in the hands of all people. There were people working in the security field who were using that device and they were also hurt,” he said. David Kennedy, a former US National Security Agency intelligence analyst, told CNN the explosions seen in videos shared online appear to be “too large for this to be a remote and direct hack that would overload the pager and cause a lithium battery explosion.” “It’s more likely that Israel had human operatives… in Hezbollah… The pagers would have been implanted with explosives and likely only to detonate when a certain message was received,” he said. “The complexity needed to pull this off is incredible. It would have required many different intelligence components and execution. Human intelligence (HUMINT) would be the main method used to pull this off, along with intercepting the supply chain in order to make modifications to the pagers.” Kim Ghattas, a Lebanese journalist and contributing writer to The Atlantic magazine, told CNN that Hezbollah had recently “gone low tech” in an attempt to prevent more of its operatives from being assassinated. In a February speech, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah called on his fighters to discard their mobile phones, saying, “shut it off, bury it, put it in an iron chest and lock it up.” Pagers made by European distributor More details emerged Wednesday of how Israeli intelligence may possibly have engineered the unprecedented attack. Hsu, the founder of pager manufacturer Gold Apollo, said its European distributor established a relationship with the Taiwanese firm about three years ago. At first, the European company only imported Gold Apollo’s pager and communication products, he said. Later, the company told Gold Apollo they wished to make their own pager and asked for the right to use the Taiwanese firm’s brand, he said. Hsu said Gold Apollo had encountered at least one anomaly in its dealings with the distributor, citing a wire transfer that took a long time to clear. In a statement, Gold Apollo said the company that produces and sells the AR924 pager model is Hungary-based BAC Consulting KFT. Taiwan has no record of Gold Apollo pagers being shipped to Lebanon or the Middle East, a senior Taiwanese security official told CNN on Wednesday. Gold Apollo shipped about 260,000 pagers from Taiwan from January 2022 to August 2024, mostly to the United States and Australia, the official said. Lebanese officials have urged citizens with pagers to discard them, warned hospitals to be on “high alert,” and asked health workers to urgently report to work to assist with the “large number of injured people.” The explosions come after Israel’s security cabinet voted Monday to add another war objective to its ongoing conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to their homes. “Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Monday. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani, pictured in July, was among those injured, according to semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters After nearly a year of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. The US was “not involved” in the series of pager explosions in Lebanon and was “not aware” of any attack in advance, according to a State Department spokesperson. Following the attacks, European airlines Air France and Lufthansa suspended flights to Tel Aviv at least through Thursday “due to the security situation locally.” Air France said it is also suspending flights to Beirut through Thursday, amid fears of escalation in the region.

The country’s security cabinet voted on the measure during a late night meeting that lasted into the early hours of Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said, adding that “Israel will continue to act to implement this objective.” Though the return of residents of northern Israel has long been understood to be a political necessity, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal. According to Israeli government data shared with CNN last month, more than 62,000 people from the north of the country are internally displaced since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began on October 8, a day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel. Across the border in Lebanon, more than 94,000 have been displaced, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Officials and residents from Israel’s northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. The addition of the new war aim may push Israel to shift its military focus to its northern front as it warns that its patience for reaching a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah is running thin. Earlier on Monday, Netanyahu told US envoy Amos Hochstein in Tel Aviv that it won’t be possible to return the northern residents without a “fundamental change in the security situation in the north,” according to his office. He added that Israel will “do what is necessary” to safeguard the region’s security and return the residents to their homes. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was however more specific, saying in a post on X after meeting Hochstein that the only way to allow the residents of the north to return is “though military action.” Hochstein cautioned Netanyahu against initiating a wider war in Lebanon, Axios reported , citing sources it didn’t identify. Hezbollah has said that it will end its attacks on Israel when Israel ends its war in Gaza. Gallant’s fate The addition to Israel’s war aims comes amid reports in Israel that Netanyahu plans to replace Gallant with a former rival politician, Gideon Sa’ar. Unlike Gallant, who served for decades in the Israel Defense Forces, Sa’ar is a near lifelong politician. Reports of his potential appointment as defense minister have already caused a stir in Israel’s political and military establishment. Tension between the prime minister and Gallant had been omnipresent in their relationship, despite a period of unity following Hamas’ October 7 attack.

Gallant, who had increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned colleagues that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.” “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time,” he added. Dismissing Gallant could cause a backlash in Israel. Netanyahu’s attempt to fire him in March last year due to Gallant’s opposition to the government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary prompted large public protests. The prime minister eventually backed down. On Monday evening, crowds gathered outside Sa’ar’s house in Tel Aviv to protest his potential appointment and express concerns about its possible impact on the fate of the hostages in Gaza. Opposition leader Benny Gantz on Tuesday slammed reports of Gallant’s potential dismissal. “Replacing a minister of defense on the brink of a possible more intense campaign in the north, which could turn into a regional war is, in my opinion, is irresponsible security-wise,” he said in a statement. He said the addition of the new war aim was “better late than never.” CNN’s Mick Krever contributed to this report."

This is the first time since the October 7 attacks that Blinken has visited the Middle East without visiting Israel. The top US diplomat typically uses the visits to Israel to press the Israeli government on the critical issues surrounding the war, including the hostage and ceasefire deal. However, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently rebuffed the administration in the hours and days following those meetings. At the time of Blinken’s last visit in August US officials were projecting public optimism that they could be close to bringing the deal to a close. Now, that public optimism around a quick resolution has largely vanished. The State Department said in their announcement that Blinken “will meet with Egyptian officials to discuss ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of all hostages, alleviates the suffering of the Palestinian people, and helps establish broader regional security.” He will also “co-chair the opening of the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty,” the statement said, noting that the “strategic dialogue aims to strengthen the bilateral relationship and deepen economic development, as well as increase people-to-people ties through culture and education.” Egypt is a critical player in the ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire deal, but Blinken’s trip is unlikely to yield a major breakthrough on the agreement that comes down to the political will of two men: Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. There is skepticism that either wants to reach a deal. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield notably said on Monday that an agreement is ultimately dependent on political will. “We continue to work with Egypt and Qatar to find a way forward in the negotiations that will be acceptable to both parties. But as hard as we are going to work on texts and creative formulas, this is ultimately a question of political will,” Thomas-Greenfield said. While Blinken is in Egypt this week, the families of the US hostages held by Hamas will be visiting Washington, DC, as they continue pushing urgently for a deal to release their loved ones. But any timeframe for next steps remains elusive. The US proposal to find a solution to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas has yet to be presented to both sides and when that will happen remains unclear, despite US officials claiming earlier this month that it was near completion. “We will offer this detailed proposal, I hope in the coming days, and then we’ll see,” said CIA director Bill Burns on September 7. The US accused Hamas of adding “new demands” to the existing proposal after the murder of six hostages in their custody in Gaza. US officials have not publicly detailed those new demands. Netanyahu has also been accused of adding new conditions to the negotiations. The last time Blinken visited Israel, he said that Netanyahu had agreed to the “bridging proposal” meant to close to close the remaining gaps with Hamas. But the next day, Netanyahu reportedly told hostage families that Israel would never leave the Philadelphi corridor – a key aspect of a deal – in comments a senior administration official pushed back on as “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line.” Less than two weeks later – after six hostages were executed by Hamas – Netanyahu said there was no deal in the making. Still, US officials have been reticent to directly criticize Netanyahu despite his unhelpful public comments. Blinken said earlier this month that “it’s incumbent on both parties” – Israel and Hamas – “to get to yes” on the “remaining issues” related to a ceasefire and hostage deal. But last week Sinwar wrote a rare letter to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, according to the Lebanese militant group, in which he reaffirmed his commitment to fighting Israel. And Netanyahu’s comments earlier this month that there is “not a deal in the making” served as a major rebuke of the Biden administration’s claims that an agreement is nearly finished. A senior Biden administration official said earlier this month that the majority of the details of the first phase of the agreement had been worked out. The remaining sticking points, they said, are related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces within Gaza away from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Blinken said last week: “we’re down to a handful of issues – not even a handful of issues – that are hard but fully resolvable, in our judgment.” “Right now, we’re working intensely with our Egyptian and Qatari counterparts to work together to bridge any remaining gaps.  And in the coming time, very soon, we’ll put that before the parties and we’ll see what they say,” he said. Blinken’s comments, however, echoed his sentiments for months. In late July, Blinken said that the talks were “inside the 10-yard line,” but also noted that the last 10 yards are “often the hardest.” As of now, President Joe Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present the president with an updated proposal in the ceasefire negotiations , two senior administration officials told CNN – the latest indication that talks to end the conflict have seriously stalled. Recent comment by US officials have been careful to work in a dose of apprehension. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Thursday said the US was still working on the bridging proposal. He acknowledged that it remains unclear if “we’re going to be able to get there” on a deal."

The projectile was fired from Yemen toward Israel at 6am local time on Sunday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) who added that it “most likely fragmented in mid-air.” The missile fell in an open area in central Israel, with no injuries reported. Videos and images shared by the Israel Fire and Rescue Authority on Telegram show large plumes of smoke billowing into the air over an open field, and shattered glass inside a train station in Modi’in, a city between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A spokesman for the Iran-backed Houthis military spokesman confirmed the attack, claiming that the group used a “new hypersonic ballistic missile” and warning that Israel should expect more such strikes as the first anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas approaches. The IDF told CNN that the projectile was not a hypersonic missile. Despite months of tensions it is a rare instance of a missile penetrating as far as central Israel, normally safe for civilians.

Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas’ political bureau, commended the strike in a public letter to Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi, the leader of Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement, saying it “sent a message to the enemy that the plans of containment and neutralization have failed.” The letter emphasized Hamas’ readiness for a prolonged conflict, vowing that combined efforts with the Houthis, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and other regional actors would ultimately break Israel’s political and military strength. Israeli police said they were working with the police bomb squad in the Shfela area, also known as the Judaean Foothills, where an interceptor fragment had fallen. Authorities are now isolating the impact site and scanning for additional interceptor remains, police said. Sirens rang across central and northern Israel, the military said, and sirens were also sounded at Tel Aviv airport, the airport’s spokesperson told CNN. Videos on social media showed passengers running to find shelter. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a news conference in Tehran that Iran hasn’t provided the Houthis with hypersonic missiles. “They have the technology, they learned it even before this war started. They are producing them themselves,” Pezeshkian said. Iran unveiled its first hypersonic missile last year, boasting that it can reach Tel Aviv in 400 seconds . Also on Sunday morning, approximately 40 projectiles crossed from Lebanon into Israel’s northern region, some of them intercepted and others falling in open areas, the IDF said. No injuries were reported, and authorities are putting out fires caused by the fallen projectiles. Hezbollah has been firing almost daily barrages of projectiles and drones into Israel. “The existing reality will not continue,” said Netanyahu, adding that a “change in the balance of power” is needed at the northern border to ensure residents could return home. The IDF meanwhile opened an investigation following reports that leaflets were dropped in southern Lebanon warning civilians to leave. The leaflets, written in Arabic and found in the area of Wazzani, a village within a few kilometers of the border with Israel, told residents that Hezbollah was firing from their area and that they should “not come back to this area until the end of the war.” The IDF said in a statement Sunday that the disperal of leaflets was “an independent initiative of the 769th Brigade in the Northern Command,” and was not approved by the IDF’s high command. Fears of escalation Tensions between Israel, Yemen and Lebanon have been escalating for months as Israel has waged its war on Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 attacks. World leaders have warned of the potential for a wider Middle East conflict. Since the war began, the Iran-backed Houthi group, which controls Yemen’s most populous regions, has regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles. Most of these have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. It has also targeted shipping in the Red Sea, as a rejection of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Most notably in July, the group claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center – the first time the city has been struck by a Houthi drone. Israel struck back the next day with deadly airstrikes on a Yemeni port – the first such strike on Yemen, according to Israeli officials. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon has also carried out attacks on northern Israel, sending rockets and drones on Saturday targeting Israeli military sites. These direct attacks on each other’s soil have raised alarm that there could be a new front in the ongoing conflict, which is already threatening to spill over across the region. Israel launched its war in Gaza after the militant group Hamas’ cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Since then, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military operations in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its figures, but says most of the dead are women and children.

AI could contribute $320 billion to the Middle East by 2030, about 2% of the total global benefits, according to a report from consultancy PwC . “There’s huge investments going into (AI) in the Middle East,” said Stephen Anderson, Middle East strategy and markets leader at PwC, speaking to CNN at last week’s Global AI Summit (GAIN) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “Here in the region, people were much more prepared to experiment and get involved with AI than maybe some other parts of the world,” he added. One issue around the rapid growth of AI is that it can be hugely energy intensive, and it is increasingly becoming a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Google reported that its 2023 emissions were nearly 50% more than in 2019 , which it partly attributed to the energy demands of AI. Energy demand from AI, data centers and cryptocurrencies could double by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency . But Anderson believes that Gulf countries, whose economies are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, are well placed to become “major players” in the technology, and have the potential to make it greener. “We’re at the center of the world when it comes to energy – not just old energy, but particularly new energy,” he said. “This is the lowest-cost place anywhere in the world to produce solar energy. So the opportunity to combine sustainability and energy with the computer power that’s required from an AI perspective is really important.” Anderson pointed to the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia as the region’s leading investors in AI. As Saudi Arabia looks to cut its economy’s reliance on oil and gas, it has invested heavily in AI, which it says will help to realize the objectives outlined in its “Vision 2030” strategy, a government program to diversify the economy. According to a recent projection from the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA), which hosted the GAIN summit, AI will contribute 12% of its GDP by 2030, with the sector growing at an annual rate of 29%. Gulf states are investing heavily in AI as they look to diversify their economies. CNN There have been significant efforts across the region to develop Arabic-language models trained on local datasets that capture the nuances of the language in a way that has been lacking on platforms like ChatGPT. Last year, the UAE unveiled a tool called Jais and Saudi Arabia has developed the Arabic chatbot ALLaM. Last week, it was announced that ALLaM will be hosted on Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform . This follows the news from earlier this year that it would also be accessible through IBM’s watsonx platform. Nick Studer, CEO at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman Group, who attended the GAIN summit, said that the focus on Arabic language models could help Saudi Arabia compete with English-speaking markets that have an “underlying advantage” in the space because of the many large language models available According to Studer, there are over half a dozen Arabic-based large language models in development in the country, focusing on a range of uses cases, from chat to governmental and corporate applications. “That combination of governmental and private sector entrepreneurialism may well lead to the development of an AI hub, particularly as the kingdom and the wider region seek to diversify their economies,” he said. Challenge of governance One of the major hurdles with the development of AI is public perception and governance: how should AI and data be regulated safely, securely, ethically and fairly? During the summit, various policies were announced, including the launch of guidelines from the SDAIA addressing the responsible use of deep fakes, the unveiling of the Riyadh Charter for AI in the Islamic World, which establishes a framework for developing AI technologies in line with Islamic values and principles, and a global framework for AI readiness , led by the International Telecommunication Union. Studer says a solid regulatory framework is essential for the future of AI. “There are many concerns that go with the development of AI - not just privacy concerns, not just the risks of losing jobs, but also all the way up to national sovereignty if your economy starts to rely on a set of tools which are built outside of your control,” he said. “It is critical that we have sensible regulation in place.”"

The hostages were two soldiers - Corporal Nick Beiser and Sergeant Ron Sherman – and and civilian man, Eliya Toledano. Recovering the hostages captured by Hamas on October 7 is one of the main goals of Israel’s campaign in Gaza and the government is under intense domestic pressure to secure their release. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the families of all three were informed Sunday after the conclusion of the investigation, which involved intelligence and operational research efforts and considerations of the security of the hostages. “It is estimated that the three were most likely killed as a by-product of an IDF airstrike, during the assassination of the commander of the northern division of Hamas, Ahmed Andor, on November 10, 2023.” “This is an estimate with a high probability in view of all the data, but it is not possible to determine with certainty the circumstances of their death,” the IDF said. “This determination is based on the location where their bodies were found in relation to the impact of the attack,” as well as intelligence findings and pathological reports.

At the time of the attack, the IDF did not have information about the presence of hostages in the compound that was attacked, and moreover, there was information that indicated their location elsewhere.” The IDF said that throughout the war, it has not attacked in areas where there are indications or suspicions about the presence of hostages. The bodies of the three hostages were retrieved from the tunnel where Andor had been staying on December 14. Later that month Hamas claimed that the three hostages were “killed by IDF weapons.” A total of 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). 35 of those are believed to be dead. Hostage release efforts are ongoing and gained new urgency earlier this month with the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah, including the Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin . US officials are trying to get both sides to agree to a deal first laid out by US President Joe Biden in May. The three-phase proposal pairs the release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.” Since then talks have stuttered and both sides have pointed to what they see as glaring holes in the framework, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that Israel’s forces will never leave the stretch along the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor."

The sound of Israeli drones buzzes overhead – a stark reminder of the fighting that has engulfed the strip for more than 11 months. “We have war, no schools… Yet the children are eager to learn,” Al Ghoul told CNN. She decided to set up a rudimentary classroom in the same tent in which she’s living, just to give some first-graders a chance to study. “Even the parents come and ask about their children’s progress in writing, asking if they are improving.” But her initiative is the exception. As children across the Middle East begin the new semester, those in Gaza will be unable to return to school.

The IDF has said strikes on schools target Hamas militants and has previously insisted it take steps to minimize harm to civilians. Hamas has denied embedding fighters in civilian infrastructure. Many schools have turned into makeshift shelters, as hundreds of thousands of people seek refuge from Israel’s bombardment. Several Palestinian children told CNN that days spent learning have been replaced by a struggle for survival. Some spend hours queueing for water or food aid, as Israel’s siege has depleted supplies. Aid workers say that displacement camps are crammed with children who have no safe space to play. . “I aspired to complete my studies and help my father feed my family,” said Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a 19-year-old English literature student, displaced in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza. She told CNN on Friday that she had registered for her university course last fall – just before the hostilities erupted. “The war destroyed all my ambitions and there was nothing left.” Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least 41,182 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000 others, the Ministry of Health there reported on Thursday.

The Israeli offensive in Gaza has displaced 1.9 million people, according to the UN – almost the entire population. Sajid, a young Palestinian displaced in Deir al-Balah, told CNN he dreamed of becoming a doctor, before the war disruption access to education in Gaza. CNN “We used to study, attend classes, do homework, and our lives were happy,” Maryam Shtawi, a young girl staying in the shelter, told CNN on Monday. “Because of the war, we were displaced, and there is no more education, nothing else – no studies.

If I had stayed in school, I would have grown up to become a famous doctor.” There’s no guarantee of safety for those sheltering in schools. At least 70% of schools run by UNRWA have been hit during the war – 95% of which were being used as shelters for displaced people – the agency reported on September 9 . On Wednesday, at least 18 people, including UNRWA staff, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a UN school-turned-shelter in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, according to the Gaza Civil Defense and hospital officials. The IDF claimed the school “was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel.” UNRWA said that their employees were teachers. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described Israeli strikes on schools as “dramatic violations of international humanitarian law.” Children have also been uprooted from one shelter to another, parents told CNN. The lack of stability or routine will compound psychological trauma for children who have witnessed scenes of bloodshed, lost loved ones or been orphaned by the war, according to UNICEF. “The students’ situation is tough; they need to be learning right now… Unfortunately, none of the students can write. There are no schools, no books, nothing,” said Mohammad Masoud, a teacher. “Instead of being in their classes or universities, students are either selling on the streets or trying to help their families by standing in line for water or food.” Meanwhile, at least 19,000 children have been separated from their parents or caregivers, the UN reported in August . ‘They are literally wading through rubbish’ Further south, in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, children run barefoot through the littered streets, according to a relief worker in the sprawling coastal town.

There aren’t really safe spaces for kids to play. “I’ve seen children with no shoes on, barefoot and amongst rubbish dumps that extend as far as the eye can see. They are literally wading through rubbish, plastic, all sorts of waste.

Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were also added to the list, according to a diplomatic source. “It’s a case of compounding vulnerabilities that are unlike any other place I have worked as a humanitarian,” said Allcock. “The actions taken by the Israeli military that have resulted in this situation – the denial of adequate aid, the bombardment and airstrikes on civilians and humanitarian zones – is a violation of every kind of possible child right that is enshrined in international law.”"

One of Israel’s most wanted men, Sinwar hasn’t been seen since the war. He also hadn’t been publicly heard from for almost a year – until this week. On Tuesday, he issued his first statement since the war, congratulating Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune for his election victory, according to Hamas’ Telegram channel. The next day, his office said he wrote letters thanking those who offered condolences for Haniyeh’s death. And on Friday came the letter to Nasrallah.

I’m constantly updated and aware of everything happening outside Gaza,” said Muhammad Shehada, a writer and analyst from Gaza. “He wants to show that he is able to operate on multiple fronts, the domestic front – the battlefield in Gaza – and the diplomatic front – mediations.” The target audience for such letters, he said, is primarily Israel, to whom Sinwar is attempting to show that despite efforts to find him, he is still able to continue working without interference. The other target, Shehada added, is Hamas, including “skeptics from inside the movement or even mediators like Qatar, the US and Egypt, who doubt that he might be able to fulfill his leadership role from the tunnels in Gaza.” Sinwar was named political leader of Hamas after Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran in July. He is seen as more hardline than his predecessor in dealings with Israel and favors cooperation and closer ties with Iran and allied Islamist groups such as Hezbollah. Shehada said Sinwar is “one of the strongest advocates of a stronger relationship with Hezbollah and Iran, and deepening the alliance with the Axis of Resistance.” “He is perceived in the movement as pragmatic, but at the same time very unpredictable and impulsive. But pragmatic nonetheless,” he said. In his letter to Nasrallah, Sinwar vowed to continue defending Islamic holy sites, particularly Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa Mosque “until the expulsion and eradication of the occupation from our land, and the establishment of our independent state with full sovereignty and its capital Jerusalem.” The October 7 attack, he said, was “one of the most honorable battles in the history of our Palestinian people.” CNN’s Ibrahim Dahman and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Brigadier General Yossi Sariel, who led its 8200 intelligence unit, has informed them he will “conclude his role in the near future.” The country’s public broadcaster Kan and several other media outlets have published excerpts of his resignation letter stating he feels personally responsible for not preventing Hamas from launching the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. “On October 7th at 06:29 I did not fulfill the task as I expected of myself, those at my command and commanders expected me and the citizens of the state I love so much,” the letter said. “Today, in accordance with the state of the war, the processes of the gathering ranks and the building of the unit’s resilience, and after the completion of the initial investigative processes, I request to fulfill my personal responsibility as the commander of the unit on October 7 and at a time to be determined by my commanders to pass the baton to the next shift,” it continued. Shortly after the attack, a number of top defense and security officials came forward to take responsibility, to some extent, for missteps that led to Hamas’ attack on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. On October 16, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency , Shin Bet, tasked with combating terrorism, wrote a statement saying: “The responsibility is on me.” “Despite a series of actions we carried out, we weren’t able to create a sufficient warning that would allow the attack to be thwarted,” Shin Bet chief Ronan Bar said. Later that month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also received sharp public criticism after he accused security chiefs in a later-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending attack. In a May interview with Dr. Phil McGraw on the “Dr. Phil Primetime” show, Netanyahu admitted there were political and military failures. “The government’s first responsibility is to protect the people. That’s the ultimate enveloping responsibility. People weren’t protected. We have to admit that,” Netanyahu told Dr. Phil. When asked if he held himself to that standard and failed in some way he added, “I hold myself and everyone on this. I think we have to examine how it happened.

UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, said on X that six of its employees were killed “when two airstrikes hit a school and its surroundings in Nuseirat,” in what is “the highest death toll among our staff in a single incident.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that the Israeli Air Force had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists” operating inside the school compound. It claimed the school “was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel.” Later on Thursday, the IDF said three of the UNRWA employees killed in the strike were members of Hamas, but did not immediately provide evidence to support the allegation. UNRWA said the three people named by the IDF were teachers, and their names were not included in previous lists of UNRWA staffers that Israel claimed were members of Hamas, including a list from July. The IDF said earlier that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,” saying the incident was “a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law.” The strike targeted the Al Jaouni UNRWA facility, which has not operated as a school since October. An estimated 12,000 displaced people, including women and children, have been sheltering in the school, said UNRWA.

Mahmoud Basal, a Gaza Civil Defense spokesman, said search operations were ongoing amid the rubble, with children and women among the injured. The strike drew condemnation from various officials, including the UN chief. “What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X. “These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now.” His spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, added on Thursday that “the IDF stated that they had targeted a command-and-control center in the compound. This incident must be independently and thoroughly investigated to ensure accountability.” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said UN staff were working and “providing support to families who have sought refuge in the school.” “Since the beginning of this war, at least 220 UNRWA staff have been killed in Gaza ,” he wrote on X. “The longer impunity prevails, the more international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant.” Sam Rose, a senior official at UNRWA, told the BBC in an interview on Thursday that the school had been used as a polio vaccination center just a week before it was struck. Earlier this month, the United Nations led a campaign to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza against polio , amid a resurgence of the disease in the strip since the war began. The head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also condemned the strike, writing on X : “Indeed, terribly tragic. No words can reflect the true horror and loss of life in Gaza.” “Hospitals, schools and shelters have been repeatedly bombarded, resulting in deaths of civilians and humanitarians,” he added. “The carnage in Gaza must stop. Ceasefire!” People use a blanket to transport a victim after an Israeli air strike hit the Al Jaouni school in Nuseirat, in the central Gaza Strip on September 11, 2024. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images A colleague of the UN workers who were killed told CNN that the group had been distributing food aid earlier and had just sat down to eat lunch when Israel bombed the school. The strike hit the school seconds after she had left to fetch water for the rest of the team from the next room, she said, asking to remain anonymous because she isn’t authorized to speak to the media. “Suddenly, I heard a big explosion. Everything shook. I ran back to see that they had all vanished… all torn to pieces,” she told CNN on the phone, referring to her colleagues. All six of the UNRWA workers had worked as teachers at the school before the war started and they were well-known members of the local community, she added. “They are all loved by everyone. They helped and provided aid to everyone… What Israel is claiming is an unacceptable lie. No resistance fighters existed or operated from the school,” she said. ‘We are all civilians here’ Footage from the scene showed debris strewn around a compound and blood stains on the ground. A hole punctured what appeared to be a classroom and among the rubble was canned food and the dust-covered belongings of displaced Palestinians. A man carrying human remains said: “Brutality, I don’t know what to say.” Another man searched desperately for his wife and four children. “I don’t know where they are, my son, my three daughters are all missing,” Hani Haniya said from a classroom in the building. “They normally sit here, I don’t know where my wife is, she survived the last strike.” Displaced Palestinians take shelter at a UN school and watch after an Israeli air strike hits the site in Nuseirat, Gaza Strip, on September 11, 2024, amid the ongoing war in the Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas.

We don’t have any resistance fighters here, none of them enter the school. Look around, it’s all food aid,” he said. “The people who were distributing the aid are the ones who died, civilians. We are all civilians here who are dying,” he added. Hassan Al Hilu, who had been displaced from Gaza City, was working on the school’s sewage pipes when the strike hit the building. He was thrown in the air by the blast, injuring one of his hands. “They are all very good people. I know them all. They are all UNRWA workers. They were always working on distributing aid, like rice, coupons, cleaning products to people in the school,” Al Hilu told CNN. “They were eating (when the strike hit).” Rabia Al Burdeini, who lives next to the school, told CNN that some of the victims were “torn to pieces” while others lost their limbs. “Suddenly, without any prior warning.” FILE - Yahya Sinwar chairs a meeting with leaders of Palestinian factions at his office in Gaza City, April 13, 2022.

Mohammed Qassem Al-Shaer, a commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, was killed in a strike on the village of Qaraoun in the western Beqaa district on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF said Al-Shaer had “advanced numerous terrorist activities against the state of Israel” and his “elimination” would impair the Iran-backed militant group’s ability to launch attacks against Israel from southern Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed Al-Shaer had been killed and said it responded to his killing by launching “dozens” of Katyusha rockets and several drones toward two locations in northern Israel. No casualties were reported, according to the IDF, which said some of the “projectiles” were intercepted and others fell in an open area. The IDF said it responded by striking Hezbollah launchers “in the areas of Mansouri and At Tiri,” which had been used in the attacks. On Wednesday, the IDF said it struck overnight 30 Hezbollah launchers and “terrorist infrastructure sites” in areas of southern Lebanon which “posed a threat to Israeli civilians.” Lebanese state media NNA reported multiple Israeli strikes overnight on several areas, some of which caused “extensive damage” to property, crops, and buildings in the town of Al-Qlaileh. In a statement Wednesday, Hezbollah said that another fighter was killed, but did not say where or the cause of death. It also did not mention the strikes.

A visual guide The Israeli military also said Tuesday its air force had struck a Hezbollah military structure in the village of Rachaf in the Nabatieh governorate of southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s emergency service said 12 people were wounded in the strike 12 on Rachaf. The latest strikes come weeks after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. Shukr was the most high-ranking Hezbollah official to have been assassinated since 2016, when Mustafa Badreddine , the group’s top commander at the time, was killed in Syria. The hostilities in July raised the specter of a regional conflagration, prompting intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on October 7.

Raneen Sawafta/Reuters Israeli strike on the occupied West Bank Israeli raids continued in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday with the IDF saying its “aircraft conducted an aerial strike during the counterterrorism operation in Tulkarem.” At least five people were killed in an overnight Israeli airstrike, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, after the Israeli military said Wednesday it carried out operations in the areas of Tammon and Tubas. The IDF said it began the operation with the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) “against terrorist infrastructures,” and an air strike was carried out on “an armed terrorist squad” in the Tubas area, the IDF said. The IDF added in a later statement that an Israeli “aircraft struck and eliminated a terrorist cell consisting of five terrorists armed with explosives who posed a threat to the forces” during its overnight operations in Tubas and Tammon. The governor of Tubas, Ahmad As’ad, told CNN the strike hit a group of “young unarmed Palestinians” around 3 a.m. local time. The group, who were in their teens and twenties, were sitting near a mosque at the time, he said. As’ad also said five people were killed, as did the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Video obtained by CNN showed at least one motionless body near a mosque in Tubas. As’ad said “we were informed by the Palestinian Coordination Office of an Israeli military operation on the city and surrounding areas” before the strike. Israeli forces raided the city and blocked access to the government hospital, he said, adding that there is an Israeli military imposed curfew. “The situation is dangerous,” he said. CNN has reached out to the IDF. The Israeli military has carried out major raids and airstrikes in multiple parts of the West Bank in recent weeks. On August 28, it launched a large counter-terror operation with the ISA in the areas of Jenin, Tulkarem and Tubas in the north of the West Bank, in an offensive Israel said was its most expansive in years. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that operation had been staged to “thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” claiming that Iran was working to establish an “eastern front” against Israel. Israel has stepped up its military operations in the West Bank, where clashes have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. Around 700 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah and the UN, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians."

Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, Gal Hirsch, told CNN’s Jessica Dean on Sunday that if all remaining 101 hostages are returned, “I even believe that we will agree to build safe passage to the chief terrorist, the new Hitler, Sinwar – safe passage to him and whoever he wants to join him out of Gaza.” Hirsch said those conditions, along with Gaza being “demilitarized and deradicalized,” could help recover Gaza and end the war.

We want demilitarization, de-radicalization of course — a new system that will manage Gaza.” He told Bloomberg that the offer of safe passage was put on the table a day and a half ago, but did not say what the response was. Israel would be open to releasing prisoners it holds as part of any deal, he told Bloomberg. CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment on Hirsch’s proposal, and has contacted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office for comment. On Wednesday, a diplomat briefed on ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel told CNN that there’s no indication that Sinwar wants to leave Gaza and that a potential safe passage out of the territory is not a priority for him. Sinwar believes he’s safer in Gaza than he would be in other countries like Iran or Lebanon, the diplomat said. Gal Hirsch appears on CNN on Sunday, September 8. CNN Sinwar, one of Hamas’ most powerful figures, is accused by Israel of being the key architect of the October 7 massacre in Israel, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostages. He is also among the Hamas leaders charged by US prosecutors over the deadly attack. Hamas announced Sinwar as the head of its political bureau last month, days after former political bureau head and top negotiator Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. He is believed to remain at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, US officials believe. He has not been seen in public since October 7. CNN’s Becky Anderson contributed to this report."

Israel said the operation targeted Hamas fighters there. At least 19 bodies arrived at hospitals from the humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi , according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. More than 60 people were also wounded, it said, as rescuers raced to recover victims buried under sand and debris. “People thought they were asleep safely. Suddenly we woke up to the sounds of explosions, and fires were surrounding us from every side. We didn’t know where the strike hit, where the remains are, or where the blood is. Everything was scattered,” Mahmoud Al Nims, a resident, told CNN.

Gaza’s humanitarian crisis hits new lows as sanitary conditions plummet According to the IDF, among those targeted were Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, whom the IDF says was the head of Hamas’ aerial unit in Gaza; Osama Tabesh, whom was “the head of the observation and targets department in Hamas’ military intelligence headquarters;” and Ayman Mabhouh, whom it said was “another senior Hamas terrorist.” The targets were “directly involved in the execution” of the October 7 attack on Israel and had been planning to “carry out terror activities” against the IDF and Israel, an IDF statement on Tuesday added. CNN is working to independently verify these claims. Hamas has denied it had placed fighters in the area. In a statement, it called Israel’s claims that its fighters were in the area “a blatant lie, through which it (Israel) seeks to justify these heinous crimes.” ‘They told us to go to Mawasi’ The strike hit Al-Mawasi, a coastal region in Khan Younis where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled Israel’s bombardment from other parts of Gaza. Many are living in tents in an area with sparse infrastructure, scant access to shelter or life-saving humanitarian aid. The explosion created three large craters, Gaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said. The group also said its crews were facing “great difficulty” in retrieving victims – many of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the time of the strikes – due to a lack of resources. Earlier, Gaza’s Civil Defense said 40 people had been killed , though the reason for the discrepancy in the two figures was not immediately clear. Human rights agencies have repeatedly criticized Israeli attacks in designated safe zones. On Tuesday, the Norwegian Refugee Council accused Israeli forces of “forcing Palestinians in Gaza to flee from place to place without offering them genuine assurances of safety, proper accommodation or return once hostilities end.” The Israeli military has placed nearly 86% of the Gaza Strip under evacuation orders, according to the UN. At least 1.9 million people have been displaced The strike was also strongly condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, whose spokesperson Stephane Dujarric described the use of heavy weaponry in densely populated areas like Al-Mawasi as “unconscionable.” Dujarric said that the strike reaffirmed the Secretary General’s warnings that “there is no safe place in Gaza.” “(Israeli forces) told us to go to Mawasi and we did, and they strike us. We have been displaced a hundred times,” Taghreed Abu Assi, a Palestinian in Khan Younis told CNN.

Jehad Alshrafi/Anadolu/Getty Images The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel has flattened neighborhoods, wiped out families and created a humanitarian disaster across the enclave. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 41,020 Palestinians and injured another 94,925 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN footage from the aftermath of the strike on Al-Mawasi showed dozens of people trying to recover the remains of their belongings. Poles that used to hold up tents protruded from the sand, but the material that covered their inhabitants was buried. Mattresses, blankets and clothes were scattered around another much bigger crater on the other side of the camp. Some survivors pulled canned food from under the sand and a girl with an injured hand watched as those around her attempt to rebuild their tents. “We were sleeping peacefully in our homes when, suddenly, rockets started falling heavily on us,” one survivor, Salem Abu Jara, told CNN. “Why are people being burned here?” Families ‘disappeared in the sand’ Israel’s military said the operation was carried out with the direction of the Israel Security Agency and the Air Force, and that steps were taken to mitigate civilian harm “including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional means.” The military did not say whether it warned civilians in the area. Hamas said “dozens of unarmed civilians, most of whom were children and women” were killed in the strike. Gaza Civil Defense’s Bassal said Palestinians in the area were not warned of the strike in advance. There were more than 200 tents of displaced people at Al-Mawasi area, Bassal said, adding about 20 to 40 tents were destroyed and “entire families have disappeared in the sand.” Two weapons experts told CNN the visual evidence from the scene of the assault in Al-Mawasi suggests 2,000-pound bombs were used. “The significant damage and the size of the craters align with the expected effects of aerial bombs weighing several hundred kilograms,” Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), said on Tuesday. CNN footage from the aftermath showed emergency crews wearing bright orange vests and scouring dense, blown-out debris for survivors. Rescue personnel could be seen hauling large pieces of barbed wire and dusty mattresses in the dark. The IDF has accused Hamas and other militant groups in the Gaza Strip of continuing to “systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure, including the designated Humanitarian Area, to carry out terrorist activity against the State of Israel and IDF troops.” Israel has previously struck Al-Mawasi in its pursuit for Hamas commanders and previous strikes have caused significant civilian collateral casualties. In mid-July, a strike aimed at Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif killed at least 90 Palestinians. The following month, Israel said its intelligence community had confirmed that Deif, one of the reported masterminds of the October 7 attacks, was killed in that attack. Israel says it has killed or captured half of Hamas’s commanders and more than 14,000 combatants since the war began. However, there are clear signs of the group’s resurgence in parts of the strip previously cleared by Israeli forces, who devastated large swathes of the area in the process.

The situation “escalated quickly” after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stopped the convoy at a checkpoint on Monday and demanded to take two of its 12 passengers for questioning, according to the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric. Dujarric said the Israeli soldiers had pointed their weapons at the UN personnel and that at some point during the incident “shots were fired.” He said IDF tanks and bulldozers then “proceeded to ram the UN vehicles from the back and front, compacting the convoy with UN staff still inside.” “One bulldozer dropped debris on the first vehicle, while Israeli soldiers threatened staff, making it impossible for them to safely exit their vehicles,” he added. The convoy was later released and UN officials have confirmed their staff returned safely to a UN base. CNN has asked the IDF for comment on Dujarric’s account of the incident, which took place at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint.

However, the UN has insisted that the convoy was involved in polio vaccinations and contained national and international staff members who were meant to be rolling out the  campaign for children in Gaza City and northern Gaza. Dujarric said that despite the incident, vaccinations were able to begin in northern Gaza on Tuesday – the third phase of the UN-led campaign which is expected to continue through Thursday. On Monday, Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the UNWRA – the UN’s main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief – criticized the IDF’s conduct in the incident as “the latest in a series of violations against UN staff including shootings at convoys and arrests by the Israeli Armed Forces at checkpoints despite prior notification.”"

Blinken’s sharply worded rebuke came after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire.” In its initial inquiry into the incident, the IDF said that the shot was not aimed at the activist, but at “the key instigator” of a “violent riot” at the Beita Junction where it said Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at Israeli security forces. It didn’t name the alleged instigator. The International Solidarity Movement (ISM), with whom Eygi had been volunteering, said that its protest on September 6 was peaceful. At a news conference in London on Tuesday, Blinken said Eygi’s killing was “unprovoked and unjustified” and demanded changes to the rules of engagement of Israel forces operating in the West Bank.

No one should have to put their life at risk just for expressing their views,” he said. “Now we have the second American citizen killed at the hands of Israeli security forces. It’s not acceptable. It has to change. And we’ll be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government.” Blinken added that the United States had “long seen” reports of Israeli forces ignoring extremist settler violence against Palestinians and reports of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into the occupied West Bank in recent months. In recent months, the US has unveiled a series of sanctions targeting Israel settler violence against Palestinians. The IDF began a major raid in multiple parts of the territory last month , bulldozing highways and razing buildings in the process. OIn Tuesday, at least two Palestinians – a man and a woman – were killed during an Israeli military incursion in the city of Tulkarem, according to the Ministry of Health in Ramallah. Israeli troops and settlers have killed 692 Palestinians, including 158 children, in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. Family says Israel’s inquiry is ‘wholly inadequate’ The family of the 26-year-old activist said they were “deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional,” reiterating calls to US leaders for an independent investigation into her death. Eygi, who was born in Turkey, was shot while taking part in a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law. She was a recent graduate of the University of Washington, and had been volunteering with the same pro-Palestinian activist group as Rachel Corrie , a US citizen killed in 2003 while attempting to stop an Israeli bulldozer from demolishing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Eygi’s family, who have previously blamed Israel for her killing, said the findings of the Israeli inquiry were “wholly inadequate.” “This cannot be misconstrued as anything except a deliberate, targeted and precise attack by the military against an unarmed civilian,” the family said. The ISM also dismissed Israel’s “specious claim” that Eygi was unintentionally hit by IDF fire, describing the slain activist as “one of the hundreds of thousands of martyrs Israel has killed over decades of ethnic cleansing, displacement, and genocide.” “The military’s account of the events is blindly based on the accomplices’ version, which completely contradicts the testimonies of multiple eye witnesses, who the military did not even contact,” the group said in a statement on Tuesday. “All eyewitnesses said immediately following the killing that the scene where Aysenur was killed was completely quiet, and that there could have been no excuse to open fire, let alone directly hitting a woman peacefully standing in an olive grove.” CNN’s Kareem Khadder, Sana Noor Haq and Antoinette Radford contributed reporting."

The Israel Airports Authority, which runs the border terminal at the Allenby Crossing with Jordan , told CNN that the three men who died worked at the crossing. “The terrorist shot dead three employees of the Allenby terminal at close range,” before being killed by a security guard, the manager of the crossing, Alex Chen, said. The Allenby crossing mainly serves Palestinians and foreigners. Israelis are not allowed to use it. An Israeli policeman and soldier patrol the area near the crossing. Ammar Awad/Reuters The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “a terrorist approached the area of the Allenby Bridge from Jordan in a truck, exited the truck, and opened fire at the Israeli security forces operating at the bridge.” “Three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack,” the IDF said, adding that the assailant had been shot dead. The IDF also published a photograph of the hand gun it said was used in the attack. Israeli police spoke of “several casualties at the scene,” and also said the shooter had “been neutralized.” Jordanian authorities said a preliminary investigation had identified the suspect as Maher Diab Hussein Al-Jazi, a Jordanian citizen from Al-Hussainiya in the Maan governorate south of the capital, Amman. Al-Jazi had acted alone, the Jordanian Ministry of Interior said, adding that he had driven over the crossing in a vehicle taking commercial goods from Jordan to the West Bank. It said various authorities were now coordinating the repatriation of Al-Jazi’s body for burial in Jordan. The suspected gunman’s brother Shady Al-Jazi said his family had been surprised by the news, which they learned through satellite television. He suggested his brother’s anger at Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza may have been a motivating factor. “He used to work as a truck driver and would cross (the bridge) often to offload the truck and then return back to Jordan. But his grief over what’s happening to the Muslim nation, seeing all the killing in Gaza, and every one of us who feels passionately for his brethren, this could motivate him,” he told Jordanian news outlet Ammon in an on-air interview. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the shooting, saying the three Israelis were murdered by a “despicable terrorist.” In remarks at the beginning of the weekly government meeting, Netanyahu said Israel was “surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran’s axis of evil.” The Jordanian government also condemned the shooter’s actions, with the foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah saying the country rejects and condemns “violence and targeting civilians for any reason.” However, the ministry also hinted there was a link between extremism and Israel’s actions in Gaza and the West Bank, calling for moves “to address the root causes and de-escalate tensions” and noting Jordan’s efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. The incident comes almost two weeks after Israel’s military launched one of its most expansive operations in the West Bank in years, carrying out raids, bulldozing highways, and launching airstrikes in multiple parts of the occupied territory.

Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images Clashes in the West Bank have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. Israeli troops and settlers have killed nearly 700 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. All three land crossings between Israel and Jordan were closed following the attack, the Israel Airports Authority said. On Monday, the Yitzhak Rabin crossing connecting Jordan to Eilat and the Jordan River crossing connecting Jordan to the occupied West Bank reopened to passenger traffic, according to the AIA, which said both would open to cargo traffic from Tuesday. The Allenby Crossing remained closed Monday but is expected to open to passengers only from Tuesday. All Jordanian drivers who were questioned following the incident have since been released, and over 100 trucks have returned to Jordan, Jordanian authorities said. Jordan became the second Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel in 1994. It has been highly critical of Israel’s military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Jordan is a close ally of the United States, from which it receives substantial military aid."

The Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said three emergency workers were killed in the attack as they tried to contain a fire in the town of Froun, Nabatieh district. It said the attack was the second time an ambulance team had been targeted within 12 hours and was a violation of international law. However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike had “eliminated terrorists” from the Amal movement, a Hezbollah-allied Shia group. The Amal movement released a statement saying two of its members had been killed “while performing their humanitarian and national duty in defense of Lebanon and the South.” Hezbollah said in a statement Sunday that its fighters “bombed the Kiryat Shmona settlement” with a salvo of missiles in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, singling out the airstrike that killed the three emergency workers. The IDF said early Sunday that about 50 “projectiles” were launched from southern Lebanon toward Kiryat Shmona in upper Galilee, Israel’s northernmost territory. Most were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, it said. The Israeli military said Sunday its air force struck Hezbollah military structures overnight in the areas of Aitaroun, Maroun El Ras, and Yaroun in southern Lebanon. It also said it struck and “eliminated terrorists” from the Amal movement in the area of Froun. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati characterized Saturday’s deadly airstrike as “a blatant violation of international laws and a blatant aggression against human values,” and called on Western ambassadors and other international representatives to attend an emergency meeting at his headquarters in Beirut on Monday. CNN Related article Northern Israeli students face uncertain school year as conflict with Hezbollah persists He said the meeting aimed to demand accountability and “pressure the Israeli enemy that does not care about any law and continues to ignite the fire of its crimes against Lebanon and the Lebanese.” Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. Lebanon’s Civil Defense director Brigadier General Raymond Khattar extended his “deepest condolences” to the families of those affected. He also wished a “speedy recovery” to one of the injured men, whom the Civil Defense identified as Mohammad Amasha. The injured man had been “transferred to Tebnin Governmental Hospital, where he is undergoing surgery due to a serious injury he sustained as a result of the raid,” the Civil Defense said."

Sign up here. Khirbet Karkur, Israel CNN — In southern Israel’s Negev desert, residents of the Bedouin village of Khirbet Karkur live in tents and metal-clad makeshift homes. Not far from the border with Gaza, they hear the sounds of the war unfolding next door . There are some 300,000 Arab Bedouins living in the Negev. As Muslim-Arab citizens of Israel, many are still struggling to find their place in Israeli society 75 years after the Jewish state was established , despite many of them serving in the military. The war with Hamas has only deepened that sense of uncertainty. Bedouins living near the Gaza border feel they have been doubly victimized: first by being within striking distance of Hamas rockets with minimal protection, and second by state marginalization that has only grown worse since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. The village of Khirbet Karkur is not recognized by the Israeli state. Residents live a semi-nomadic life, in an open desert area and in dwellings that aren’t connected to the Israeli electricity grid or water supply. Like many other unrecognized villages, it has no schools or hospitals, and residents say that women have been forced to give birth in cars on the way to hospital because ambulances struggle to reach the town.

Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system often skips interceptions above their village, residents say, as it ignores projectiles that aren’t expected to fall in population centers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN it is “not possible to provide details on the aerial defense array policy due to considerations of information security.” BEER SHEVA, ISRAEL - AUGUST 28: 52-year-old Israeli captive Qaed Farhan al-Qadi, whose rescue from the Gaza Strip was announced by the Israeli army on Tuesday is welcomed with elation by his relatives in Karkor village of Beer Sheva, Israel on August 28, 2024. (Photo by Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu via Getty Images) Mostafa Alkharouf/AnadoluGetty Images Related article Frail and malnourished, rescued hostage hopes war in Gaza ends ‘for all Palestinian and Israeli families’ Villagers say the rest of the country had all but forgotten them – until last week, when a swarm of journalists travelled along dirt roads to the dusty village to mark the release of 52-year-old Farhan Al-Qadi from Hamas captivity. Khirbet Karkur is his hometown. Al-Qadi was abducted along with 250 others by Hamas-led militants on October 7. He was taken from Kibbutz Magen, where he was working as a security guard, and was rescued last week from a tunnel in Gaza by Israeli security forces, the Israeli military said. Speaking to reporters the day after his rescue, Al-Qadi said he wishes “that the war ends for all Palestinian and Israeli families.” Israeli officials have said that Al-Qadi’s kidnapping and release shows that all its citizens – Jews and Muslims alike – are equally vulnerable to terrorism, adding that the state is committed to securing the freedom of every citizen. Israel’s Bedouin community is considered a subset of the country’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population in the country of 10 million. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Al-Qadi the day he was released, and according to a transcript supplied by the Prime Minister’s Office, said: “I want you to know that we do not forget anyone, just as we did not forget you. We are committed to returning everyone, without exception.” Video Ad Feedback Israel rescues 52-year-old hostage held by Hamas in Gaza 02:23 - Source: CNN In November, the prime minister visited the IDF’s so-called Bedouin battalion in the Negev, a unit mostly made up of Muslim Bedouin soldiers, saying that “Jewish and Bedouin commanders are standing shoulder-to-shoulder,” and that “our partnership is the future of us all against these savages.” But some Bedouin leaders and residents of Al-Qadi’s village say the state is celebrating his rescue without taking proper action to address the community’s decades-long needs. Waleed Alhwashla, a Bedouin member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said that while Netanyahu and his coalition portray Israeli Arabs as equal to Jewish citizens, the reality on the ground is starkly different. “Netanyahu lies to the families of the hostages, to the world, he lies at negotiations, to (US President Joe) Biden and to America,” Alhwashla told CNN. “He cannot change the reality inside (Israel), where there are violations of freedom, human rights, the rights of the Arab minority,” he said. ‘Displacement and segregation’ The semi-nomadic Bedouin group is predominantly tribal, with family trees that extend into Gaza and Egypt’s northern Sinai. Many identify distinctly as Bedouin Israelis, while others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. Unlike most Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to do so anyway, often in specialized units operating in the Negev desert. Bedouins who join the military receive support from the state to complete high school studies, Hebrew courses and driving lessons. Some also join up to protect the land they live in, Israeli media reported , especially after October 7. Most Bedouins live in the 4,700-square-mile Negev, which before Israel’s founding in 1948 was home to some 92,000 Bedouins. Only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war that followed.

Oren Ziv/AFP/Getty Images Today, over 300,000 Bedouin citizens of Israel live in the Negev, including more than 80,000 who reside in unrecognized Bedouin villages, according to Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel. Many of those settlements predate Israel’s founding. These villages are often situated next to waste dumps, with little access to water and electricity, said Fayez Sohaiban, a relative of Al-Qadi and former mayor of the nearby Bedouin city of Rahat. “This is a humanitarian issue,” Sohaiban told CNN, adding that all Bedouin families in the Negev suffer the same challenges. “They don’t have schools, they don’t have water, they don’t have power.” “People are suffocating,” he said. Residents of unrecognized villages regularly face demolition orders for their buildings due to lack of building permits, they say. Demolitions have occurred on a “weekly” basis this year, according to the rights group Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality (NCF). In the first half of 2024 alone, 2,007 Bedouin structures were demolished by the state despite a temporary halt in the early months of the war, the group said, up from 1,767 demolitions during the same period of the previous year. Bedouin residents and leaders say their plight has worsened since the war started. Alhwashla, the lawmaker, told CNN that the government has “erased” the village of Wadi Al-Khalil during the war, adding that there are “thousands of other orders for demolition” currently in place. A man points to a hole in the roof of a building caused by a projectile that injured seven-year-old Bedouin girl Amina in her unrecognized village, in the southern Negev desert, in Israel on April 14. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images In May, Amnesty International said that Israel had demolished 47 homes in the unrecognized village of Wadi al-Khalil “without proper consultation or compensation,” adding that Israeli authorities have over the years “employed numerous pretexts to push for the displacement and segregation of the Bedouin community in the Negev,”  from expanding highways and industrial zones, to establishing forests for the Jewish National Fund and the designation of military zones. A report by the NCF said in the case of Wadi al-Khalil, the demolition was justified by the Israeli state as necessary for the extension of Highway 6, “a project not yet scheduled for construction nor budgeted by the state, despite the humanitarian crisis it caused.” Bedouin-Israeli communities are also among the poorest in the country, with close to 80% of Bedouin children living below the poverty line, NCF said, citing data from Israel’s National Insurance Institute. Their plight has worsened significantly since a far-right government came to power in 2022, residents told CNN. In August of last year, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir attended the demolition of an unrecognized village near Tel Arad in the Negev, Israeli media reported . The minister called the demolition “sacred work,” and said the residents should “understand that we govern here, that there are landlords in this country.” Some villagers are afraid to criticize the government, citing fear of retribution by the authorities, which they say has increased since October 7. Villagers say authorities closely monitor their social media for any signs of support for Palestinians in Gaza, or criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war. United Nations officials have repeatedly called on Israel to stop demolishing homes and property belonging to the Bedouin community. CNN has reached out to Israel’s Land Authority for comment. Victims of October 7 When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 22 Bedouins were killed, seven of them by rocket fire that fell onto unrecognized villages, according to Alhwashla. A total of eight Bedouins were kidnapped, according to the Hostage Families Forum. Three have been freed, one is believed to be dead in Gaza, one was killed by IDF fire while attempting to flee, and three remain in Hamas captivity, according to the forum. In April, when Israel and Iran traded direct fire for the first time, a 7-year-old Bedouin girl in the Negev was severely wounded by shrapnel from an intercepted missile, according to Israeli officials. Last week, residents of unrecognized Bedouin villages filed a petition with the High Court of Justice “demanding that the state provide protective measures against rocket and missile fire,” according to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , a partner to the petitioners. Ali al-Zayadana, the brother of Youssef and the uncle of Hamza, two Beduin men who were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, prays for them in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, in Jerusalem on March 22. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images “Approximately 85,000 residents of these unrecognized villages lack any means of protection against rocket, missile, or drone attacks,” the association said, adding that residents have since October 7 been forced to rely on “makeshift protective measures, such as sheltering under bridges, digging trenches, or finding narrow crevices in the ground.” “These villages are without sirens, Iron Dome coverage, or any formal state-regulated protection, due to their unrecognized status,” the association said, citing the petition. The IDF told CNN that “the Home Front Command maintains regular contact with the heads of local authority, the Ministry of Social Equality, and the Bedouin Administration to ensure optimal protection whenever possible,” adding that since the beginning of the war, “the Home Front Command has been working to deploy protective measures in the Bedouin dispersal areas.” Still, Bedouin communities feel that such efforts have done little to alleviate their longstanding hardships. Despite their Israeli citizenship, they feel underrepresented, neglected and that their plight has even worsened as the war grinds on. When members of the international community visit villages of the Negev, they are shocked to see citizens of Israel living this way, Sohaiban told CNN. “We hold the Israeli passport and Israeli ID card. We live in this country and respect the law, so we must be treated the same way Jews are treated,” he said. CNN’s Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting."

Witnesses describe widespread destruction of infrastructure, severed water and electricity supplies, and people rationing food for fear of going outside. It has been the deadliest period in the West Bank since November, according to the UN. The military withdrew from Jenin and Tulkarem on Friday, according to residents. But an Israeli security source said that “the overall operation in Jenin is not over, it is only a pause.” Though the war in Gaza has attracted most attention, Israel’s military has persistently and increasingly brought unsparing military tactics to the West Bank. Israel’s security forces on August 28 launched what they dubbed a “counterterrorism operation” in Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, in the northern West Bank. It has come to be known as Operation Summer Camps. “We will not let terrorism in Judea and Samaria raise its head,” the head of the Israel Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said during a visit to Jenin over the weekend, using the biblical names for the West Bank commonly used in Israel. Residents say Jenin has been left transformed and scarred. “It felt like Gaza,” 36-year-old Lina Al Amouri said by telephone from Jenin. She and her husband fled several days into the IDF incursion, but went back when they heard rumors that the operation had quieted.

Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images “When we returned yesterday, we saw that all the streets were destroyed,” she said. “Soldiers were everywhere, continuing to bulldoze everything around them, not just the streets.” “We heard many gunshots, and then we received news that my mother-in-law’s nephew had been shot seven times near the camp. They let him bleed until he died and prevented ambulances from reaching him.” The IDF has previously said that it often must impede ambulances to check for militants. Eight children killed Nearly 700 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah and the UN, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. Since the Israeli operation began last Wednesday, 39 Palestinians have been killed, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah reported. Among them were at least nine militants, according to public statements from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Eight children have also been killed according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Tawfiq Qandeel, 85-years-old, from eastern Jenin, had gone several days on meagre rations last week, too frightened to leave his house, his son Arafat told CNN. He left home on Friday to get food and attend Friday prayers. On his way back, Arafat said, he was gunned down in the street, where he lay for hours as he bled out.

Nasser Nasser/AP A video posted online Sunday by the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows his corpse lying in the nearly unrecognizable moonscape of a street. An Israeli armored personnel carrier trundles down the road – and over the dead man’s leg. In a statement to CNN, the IDF acknowledged that while disarming improvised explosive devices, security forces shot and killed “an individual approaching their position,” and that the incident was under review. “As the troops were departing the scene, an IDF vehicle inadvertently struck the deceased’s body,” it also said. The military said that it “deeply regrets any harm caused to civilians.” The Israeli military has severely restricted access to the city since its operation began, so international media have had to rely on residents, local journalists, and social media video for independent information about the operation. Journalists this week said that they were fired on by the Israeli military during a raid in Kafr Dan, near Jenin. Mohammed Mansour, a journalist for WAFA, was injured when the car he was driving was struck by gunfire, according to video of the aftermath and his employer. Armored bulldozers also daily used heavy duty plows to tear up roads. The military says this is necessary to unearth improvised explosive devices planted under the tarmac. But the tactic has caused significant infrastructure damage, leaving many roads impassable. The UN says that since October, Israeli authorities have “destroyed, demolished, confiscated, or forced the demolition” of 1,478 structures in the West Bank. Jenin’s mayor said that more than 70% of his city’s critical infrastructure has been destroyed. While deadly ground raids in the West Bank were a regular occurrence before Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack, air strikes – though not entirely unheard of – were extremely rare. When in July 2023 Israel used a drone to launch airstrikes as part of a large operation in Jenin, it made headlines around the world. Not a single Palestinian in the West bank was killed by an air strike in the preceding three years, according to the UN. ‘Don’t play with us’ Since October, such strikes have become a near-daily occurrence. And their use has dramatically ramped up in recent weeks. The UN says that of all deaths by Israeli air strikes since October, nearly a third came in August alone. “No place in Palestine is safe, not just Gaza,” Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan said during a visit to Jenin on Thursday – the first time a Palestinian official visited the city since Israel’s operation began. “We witness the occupying enemy repeating the systematic destruction I saw before, targeting both human life and infrastructure.” Brigadier General Nitzan Nuriel, who ran the counter-terrorism bureau of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office until 2012, and now serves in the reserves, said that Operation Summer Camps was launched to send a message to Israel’s adversaries. “The message to the other side is, ‘Don’t play with us. Don’t think that if we are very much down in the south and probably we are going to be busy up in the north, we will not be able to take care of what’s going in Judea and Samaria.’” The Israeli military, Halevi said during his visit to Jenin, will go “city to city, camp to camp, with excellent intelligence, very good operational capabilities, very strong aerial intelligence support, and above all, with very moral and determined soldiers and commanders.” Palestinian paramedics help to evacuate residents during an Israeli military operation in Tulkarem, West Bank, on Wednesday. Nasser Nasser/AP Duha Turkman, 18 years old, sheltered with her sister at an aunt’s house for a week when the operation began, too scared to go outside because of the Israeli snipers they saw on surrounding rooftops. “We tried to conserve food as much as we could,” she said. “We were eating very little, had no water, and no electricity.” Suddenly, on the seventh day, Israeli soldiers burst through their door, she said. A video taken by Turkman shows shrapnel pockmarking the stairwell of the house. They soon fled to an uncle’s house elsewhere in the city. “When we look at Gaza, we realize that we have been going through this for nine days, and it is already incredibly difficult for us,” she said. “We can only imagine what the people in Gaza are enduring. The situation here mirrors Gaza with airstrikes, bulldozing, and it doesn’t seem like the situation will change anytime soon.”"

But the US can’t walk away.,"For months, the United States has chased a mirage — a deal to free hostages in Gaza, to end the agony of Palestinian civilians there and to pause the fighting between Israel and Hamas.","Sep 6, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Stephen Collinson,Middle East,"CNN — For months, the United States has chased a mirage — a deal to free hostages in Gaza, to end the agony of Palestinian civilians there and to pause the fighting between Israel and Hamas. But its goal has never looked more remote, and the Biden administration has rarely been more estranged from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks and the start of the Israeli onslaught on Gaza. When an administration repeatedly predicts a foreign policy goal is in sight but fails to deliver, as this one has, it risks shattering its credibility and looks like it’s botched one of its top priorities. Politically damaging scrutiny is inevitable over why the Biden administration squandered capital on an apparently hopeless goal and how it misjudged the situation so badly. President Joe Biden’s team faces all these negative consequences and its exposure is especially acute because it now appears to be operating in a different reality from Netanyahu. Washington argues that a deal is nine-tenths of the way to completion after diplomacy involving the US and Qatar, while the Israeli leader denies it’s anywhere near close. Why the US can’t walk away The motivations that led the administration into this vicious circle of failure haven’t changed. So Washington can’t give up. Biden is under even greater pressure to secure the release of Americans believed to be held in Gaza following Hamas’ murder of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a US-Israeli citizen among six hostages whose bodies were found Sunday. For instance, even a tiny chance of a deal, which could spare other hostages, would have huge human consequences. The administration’s fervent desire to prevent a spillover regional conflict also means that ending the war remains imperative. The White House has political as well as humanitarian motives in ending the slaughter of Palestinian civilians. Anger over those casualties, especially among progressives and Arab American voters this fall, could threaten the election hopes of Vice President Kamala Harris in the key swing state of Michigan, for instance. Biden’s decision to end his reelection bid introduced a new and personal dimension of the Middle East crisis for the president. If no ceasefire takes hold in the next few months, he’d face the prospect of handing his successor a failure that would help shape his legacy. One top Democrat close to the White House told CNN’s MJ Lee that Biden had redoubled his focus on the Middle East since shelving his campaign and was “obsessed” with the issue. US officials are not yet at the point of acknowledging there may be no deal before the president leaves office. But the top Democrat said: “We’re stuck,” adding that “both parties are very dug in.” Despite its frustration, the White House has not yet used all possible leverage on Netanyahu – and probably won’t. Biden is a deeply pro-Israel president and has so far been unwilling to bow to progressive demands to restrict US arms sales to Israel to force Netanyahu’s hand. And the prospect of the US walking away from Israel and publicly blaming the impasse on an Israeli prime minister — in a way that would open it to accusations of siding with terrorists — still seems unthinkable. The fraught political circumstances are also one reason why, despite Harris’ willingness to use stiffer rhetoric toward Netanyahu, it’s hard to see her engineering a breach with Israel as one of her first major foreign policy moves if she becomes president. Netanyahu plays politics at home and in the US The showdown between Israel and Hamas is so complex because of the historical, ideological and political factors swirling around the negotiations. Both sides believe they are in an existential battle against the other. Each might believe they are winning and so they don’t want to back down. Meanwhile, the outside political factors that could force their hands have not yet reached a critical point, and third powers have been unable to create that pressure.  The incentives for Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, as horrific as those calculations may be, currently lean toward not ending the war. Bad feeling between Washington and the Israeli government spilled over when Biden on Monday said Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure the release of the hostages and after a senior administration official said later this week that 90% of an agreement had been completed. This was seen by the White House’s Republican critics as an unacceptable attempt to build pressure on Israel. Netanyahu’s latest justification for not doing a deal center on his refusal to pull troops out of land in southern Gaza known as the Philadelphi Corridor, which he says is critical to Hamas’ capacity to maintain its arms supplies. But more broadly, he says that US perceptions that a deal is near are false. “It’s exactly inaccurate. There’s a story, a narrative out there, that there’s a deal out there, that’s just a false narrative,” Netanyahu said on Fox News Thursday. He insisted that Israel had agreed to several proposed deals but that Hamas was the obstacle. “They don’t agree to anything: Not to the Philadelphi Corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jailed terrorists, not to anything.” (Reports this summer said Netanyahu also scuppered earlier deals). His appearance on Fox demonstrated Netanyahu’s long penchant for playing in US domestic politics to pressure the Biden administration at a time when Republican nominee Donald Trump is blaming Harris for the death of the hostages. There are suspicions among many Democrats that Netanyahu is prolonging the war in the hope that Trump — who delivered almost everything he wanted in his first term — could soon be back in the Oval Office. Disagreements rumbled on between the US and Israel Thursday. White House national security communications adviser John Kirby insisted it was sound to say 90% of a deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the US and Arab states, was done. “You call that optimistic, I call that accurate,” he said. The US and Netanyahu’s positions are not necessarily contradictory. It’s possible for most of an agreement to be accepted and only 10% of sticking points to remain. There are familiar echoes here: The parameters of a US-Israeli final status deal on statehood have long been known — at least until recent bursts of settlement building in the West Bank — but there has never been the political will between credible leaders on both sides to make the extraordinarily hard political decisions to solve outstanding questions. And even if a deal is agreed in the Middle East, the implementation can be even more problematic that the negotiation. Sinwar and Netanyahu have other motivations But the prospects that this agreement could finally get over the line still seem grim. Netanyahu has left no doubt that he sees the war against Hamas as part of a wider struggle against Iran and its proxies that is existential to the state of Israel and the Jewish people – a position that means he’s considering far more than push for a deal with Hamas. While he has come under extreme political pressure from families of remaining Israeli hostages to do more to get them out — notably in the resumption of street protests in recent days — the opposition to his continued premiership has not reached a critical mass necessary to topple him. Many analysts believe Netanyahu wants the war to continue to put off the inevitable inquests on how the worst terror attack in Israel’s history took place on his watch. And Netanyahu would be more vulnerable to fraud and bribery charges and trials that he’s facing if he’s out of office. And his ruling coalition — the most right-wing in Israeli history – has held up, raising questions about whether the Biden administration properly assessed his prospects for survival and the possibilities of what is politically realistic. Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, told Jim Sciutto on CNN Max on Wednesday that the key number in Netanyahu’s mind was not the tens of thousands of Israelis protesting him on the streets — but 64. “That’s the number of seats that his coalition controls and there is absolutely no indication on the part of any of the parties that they have any stake in fracturing that coalition,” Miller said. “The reality is that there is no urgency on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu or Yahya Sinwar to either let those hostages go or to redeem them through a negotiation.” In an odd way, Netanyahu and Sinwar’s situations are reinforcing the deadlock. The killing of the hostages bolsters Netanyahu’s narrative that it’s impossible to negotiate with Hamas. But the consequential public protests in Israel build the political pressure on Netanyahu that Sinwar wants to see. And the Hamas leader has shown no sign that he’s motivated by a desire to spare Palestinian civilians — his organization embedded its military infrastructure and tunnels in civilian areas of Gaza. And the more civilians who die, the greater international opposition crests against Israel, which is also in his interests. It’s hardly surprising then that there is still not agreement. The cycle of utter futility was inadvertently underscored by Harris in a CNN interview last week in which she refused to commit to an arms embargo against Israel. “We have got to get a deal done. … We have to get a deal done. This war must end and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done,” Harris said. “We have to get a deal done. We have to get a deal done.” Her repeated insistence on the need for a deal mirrored months of administration statements. But that deal never gets done."

American officials, with Qatar and Egypt, have for months worked to broker a deal to bring an end to the nearly year-long conflict. Those negotiations have taken on new urgency following the killings of six hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and American officials have said they are preparing to present a “final” offer to the parties soon. It’s not the first time over the past several months that US negotiators have described the talks as entering their end stage, only for hopes to be dashed. That’s a reality US officials have acknowledged in recent days. The painstaking negotiations have prompted the families of the remaining Americans held by Hamas to press the White House to explore a separate agreement with Hamas that would secure the release of their relatives. So far, US officials have said they are focused only on the larger deal. A senior Biden administration on Wednesday offered one of the most detailed looks yet at key elements of the negotiations, which spokespeople for the US government said they would not negotiate in public. The official offered the previously unreported details after repeated public statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casting doubt on his potential willingness to accept a deal, despite claims by the US that he had agreed to a “bridging proposal.” The agreement itself makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters on a call on Wednesday. Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the corridor is vital to Israeli security. “The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press. That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said. “In my view, the less that’s said about particular issues, the better,” the official said, adding: “Staking out concrete positions in the middle of a negotiation isn’t always particularly helpful.” In the agreement being discussed for the first phase of a deal, Israel Defense Forces are supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza. In the second phase, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from Gaza. The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal. Hamas said this week that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in. Still, the talks remain ongoing on finalizing the 18-paragraph proposal that American officials believe is the best chance of securing the hostages’ release. Of the 18 paragraphs, all but four are finished and agreed to, the official said. “We still see this deal, this very complex but necessary arrangement, as really the most viable, perhaps the only viable, option for saving the lives of the hostages, stopping the war, bringing immediate release to Gazans, and also making sure we fully account for Israel’s security,” the official said. It’s essentially down to the prisoner exchange and the deployment of Israeli forces, the official said. The deal on the table currently includes the release in the first phase of some 800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including some serving life sentences, the official said. They would be released for the remaining female, elderly and wounded or sick hostages, which was believed to be around 30. Yet Hamas has proved to be a frustrating negotiating partner of this issue, the official said. “There was some progress on last week but is difficult and requires Hamas to engage on it. Otherwise you just can’t move forward,” the official said. Frustrated by the progress of the talks, some families of Americans still held hostage by Hamas have asked the Biden administration to look into a deal that would go around Israel to secure their loved ones’ release. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the families virtually over the weekend. While not ruling out such a possibility, US officials have stressed this week that the broader deal is the best, and potentially only, viable option to secure the hostages’ release. “We are working on a proposal that would release all the hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that we’ve been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same proposal that the president met with his team over the weekend to discuss. That is what we’re working on,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday. The broader deal being discussed carries a significant aid component that would be launched immediately once the first phase goes into effect. As part of the deal, 600 aid trucks a day would be allowed into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Equipment to clear rubble, supplies to support internally displaced Gazans and provisions for rehabilitating infrastructure would also be included in the first phase of the three-phase agreement. Although the negotiators are working to close the remaining gaps, it is unclear when the in-person negotiations will resume. The latest round wrapped up last week. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier Wednesday, “We want to get this proposal developed as soon as possible and get it over to Israel and Hamas and then try to get a final agreement.” This story has been updated with additional information."

The IDF has said that its operations in the West Bank are necessary “in order to remove immediate terror threats in real time.” Humanitarian groups have accused the Israeli military of using disproportionate force against Palestinian residents, inflicting severe damage on critical infrastructure and disrupting health care services. On Tuesday, a UN spokesperson warned that Israeli forces are using “lethal war-like tactics” in the occupied territory, with people being killed, injured and displaced – and have blocked critical access to aid organizations.

We were trapped for a few minutes before we managed to get away.” Israeli forces have killed 33 Palestinians in the West Bank, including six children and two elderly people, since launching the operation last month, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.

Sign up here. CNN — With its announcement that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in, Hamas signaled the opening of a chilling new chapter in an already brutal war. Seizing on a spasm of public outrage in Israel at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inability to bring home the remaining hostages, Hamas released a comic book-style image of a kneeling figure threatened with a gun﻿, followed by a video of Eden Yerushalmi, 24, a bartender at the Nova music festival and one of six hostages who Israel says were shot at close range in Hamas captivity last week before Israeli forces could reach them. Video Ad Feedback 'I am asking for your forgiveness': Netanyahu speaks directly to hostage families 00:31 - Source: CNN In a cruel twist of timing – the funerals of the slain hostages had taken place on Sunday and Monday – Hamas said it would drip-feed footage of what it described as the “final messages” of the remaining five. It released a second video on Tuesday, featuring Ori Danino, a 25-year-old who was abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7. Danino had helped other festival-goers escape the horror. It was not clear when any of the footage was filmed – nor whether it was intended that the videos would be used in this way. Hamas’ new tactics – which Yerushalmi’s family say amount to “psychological terror” – will further fan the fury in Israeli society. For the past three days, crowds have swelled in multiple Israeli cities, with protesters blaming Netanyahu for, in their view, sacrificing Israeli citizens to stay in power, as right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down the government should he end the war. After a general strike that brought the country to a near halt on Monday, thousands of protesters took to the streets again on Tuesday, with demonstrations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, Haifa, Herzliya and Ra’anana. In Tel Aviv, some of the largest crowds gathered outside the Begin Gate of the Kirya – the military headquarters – where a site had been set aside for demonstrators including families of hostages to gather. Video footage showed fires on the street, police attempting to extinguish the flames and protesters waving flags and demanding the release of the hostages held in Gaza. Police said later they had arrested three people suspected of rioting. Yet, it remains far from clear whether such public demonstrations of anger will compel Netanyahu to change Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza. Some analysts say that unlike earlier in the war, Hamas may no longer believe that keeping hostages gives it leverage over Israel.

It knows that this current Israeli administration is not interested in any kind of hostage release deal,” Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN. “I don’t think they consider them as substantial playing cards any longer.” In a statement Monday evening, Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida said the new instructions had come into place after an “incident” in Nuseirat, seeming to refer to an Israel Defense Forces operation in June that rescued four Israeli hostages from a refugee camp in central Gaza. The raid, which killed 274 Palestinians, occurred mid-morning when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. Some of the captors were killed, and the IDF successfully retrieved the hostages unharmed, further weakening Hamas’ leverage in negotiations with Israel. Since then, the IDF has rescued one more hostage – Farhan Al-Qadi , 52, a Bedouin Israeli citizen who was retrieved from a tunnel in Gaza last week. When Hamas took some 250 people hostage from southern Israel on October 7, “they thought they could try to leverage them for a prisoner exchange deal,” Mustafa said. Although an exchange deal was struck as early as November, no further agreement has been reached 10 months later. Video Ad Feedback Protesters flood Israel’s streets to demand ceasefire 02:39 - Source: CNN A ‘watershed’ moment The successful rescues may have helped Netanyahu to argue that Israel’s twin war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages can be pursued simultaneously, making the cries for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal less urgent. But, after the murder of the six hostages under Hamas’ new directive, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday to demand Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free the hostages, in one of the largest demonstrations since the war began. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand. Instead, a defiant and bellicose Netanyahu used his first public comments since the discovery of the bodies to double down on his strategy in the strip. He said Israel will retaliate strongly against Hamas for the killing of the six hostages, hinting that the response would be akin to the strike against Hezbollah in July that killed the Iran-backed group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr. He stressed again his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeated his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a new sticking point threatening once again to derail talks to reach a deal. Video Ad Feedback Cousin of hostage killed by Hamas: Netanyahu's decisions made it impossible for hostages to return 03:04 - Source: CNN Although Netanyahu has refused to cede ground under growing pressure, analysts say the killing of the six hostages by Hamas has been a turning point, leading many in the country to ask whether Israel is reaching the limits of what its military power can achieve, and whether its offensive may be endangering the more than 100 hostages from the country still being held in Gaza. “The penny that dropped for a lot of Israelis is that going after Hamas is not complementing the return of the hostages. It is hindering and hampering the return of the hostages,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst and lecturer at Reichman University in Tel Aviv, told CNN. “It became very clear that the presence of the IDF played a direct part in the decision of their Hamas keepers to kill them,” he said. “The sense that the Netanyahu government is incompetent, that Netanyahu is doing all of this for his own reasons, is now much more powerful for a lot of people. So I think it is a watershed moment.” Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum and former senior adviser to the late Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said many Israelis have felt two waves of grief over the past three days: first, for the death of the six hostages, and then, following Netanyahu’s speech, “the realization that Netanyahu is determined to pursue an open-ended occupation of Gaza.” Protesters block a road in Tel Aviv on Sunday as they demand the release of hostages held in Gaza. Ariel Schalit/AP New red line The death of the six hostages also caused the latest spat between Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to reports in Israeli media, the two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any ceasefire deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) stretch of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. Although Netanyahu has recently begun to strongly insist that Israel maintain a military presence in the corridor for security reasons, Hamas has long been clear that the proposal is a non-starter. Gallant reportedly told Netanyahu that insisting on this condition means “there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.” Regardless, the cabinet proceeded to vote on the plans Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, with Gallant the only dissenter. Novik, the former adviser to Peres, said the newfound focus on the Philadelphi Corridor is merely symbolic. His “discovery” of the corridor and the effective elevation of its status to a holy site “has no security merit,” Novik said. If anything, an occupation of the corridor – which runs alongside densely populated towns and cities – risks endangering Israeli troops, as Israel’s previous occupation of the territory that ended in 2005 showed, Novik warned. “They’re sitting ducks,” he said. “And if Hamas managed to kill our troops in 2004 before it had the kind of munitions and equipment that they have today, the results are going to be even more devastating.” Netanyahu stands before a map of Gaza during a news conference in Jerusalem on Monday. Ohad Zwigenberg/AFP/Getty Images Since the issue of the corridor was raised last month, Hamas has said it will not agree to Netanyahu’s red line. “At this point, they cannot accept anything short of the demands they are now calling for: A complete cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops,” Mustafa said. “If they were to accept anything short of what they’re demanding, that would be political suicide for the movement.” Netanyahu’s defiant speech on Monday may have extinguished hopes that the killing of the six hostages could lead to a change in course. Former IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, who has become more critical of the government since leaving his post earlier this year, said about the remaining hostages after Netanyahu’s speech: “He sealed their fate.” The insistence on maintaining troops along the corridor may also spell further tension between Israel and the United States, which has throughout the months-long negotiations insisted that Israel must fully withdraw from Gaza after the war. When asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, President Joe Biden said simply: “No.” CNN’s Mohammed Tawfeeq, Tamar Michaelis, Lauren Kent and Hira Humanyun contributed reporting."

More than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, are still being held in Gaza – the vast majority of them taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive The scenes outside the Israeli leader’s homes culminated a day of anger that brought much of the country to a halt, following a call by the country’s largest labor union, known as Histadrut, to shut down the “entire” economy. Flights in and out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport were also stopped for two hours. But in a press conference Monday evening, the Israeli leader struck a note of defiance, batting away criticisms – including from US President Joe Biden – that he is not doing enough to secure a deal. He asked for “forgiveness” from the families of the six hostages for failing to bring them back alive, but insisted it should be Hamas that “has to make the concessions.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a news conference in Jerusalem on September 2, 2024.

Hamas meanwhile escalated its own threats on Monday, with a public warning that more hostages held in Gaza would return “inside coffins” if Israel attempts to free them militarily. A statement released by the militant group said that its fighters guarding prisoners held in the Palestinian enclave had received “new instructions” on how to deal with hostages if Israeli forces get close, and released an illustrated poster apparently showing hostages threatened with a gun.

Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images Monday saw the largest general strike to have taken place in Israel since March 2023, when there was a similar mass walkout over Netanyahu’s controversial attempts to overhaul the country’s judiciary. According to union Histadrut, hundreds of thousands of Israelis joined the protests Monday, just a day after half a million took to the streets on Sunday for what protest organizers said was one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas. Israeli police said they had seven demonstrators in Tel Aviv for “violating public order and disrupting traffic.” ‘Netanyahu has made it impossible’ Netanyahu’s defiant stance following the discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown further doubt on the negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. Even before the killing of the six hostages, the talks had become bogged down, with one key disagreement centering on control of a border area known as the Philadelphi corridor. Netanyahu says control of the 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it. However, the deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas in the ceasefire talks, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. “Hamas doesn’t want us to be there and that’s why I insist on being there,” the Israeli leader said on Monday. During a cabinet meeting over the weekend, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of the corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.” The relative of one of the hostages who was shot dead in southern Gaza also blamed Netanyahu and his stance on the corridor for their deaths. Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat, told CNN that the Israeli government “cold-bloodedly” crossed a “red line” by prioritizing the corridor over the lives of the hostages. “We know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point, and Israel was the one putting on more and more terms and actually postponing the deal,” Dickmann said on Monday. “Right now, we know the decisions that our Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it impossible for Carmel and other hostages to return and put their lives in great danger, and that’s what killed them.” But on Monday, even as he acknowledged dissent within his cabinet, Netanyahu doubled down. “We’re not going to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu told a press conference on Monday evening. “The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi corridor. We need to have it under our control,” he said. Disagreements over the corridor are only one of the splits within the cabinet over the conduct of the war that have become increasingly public and rancorous in recent months, reflecting deep divisions at the top of Israel’s government. Just on Monday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was using his power to prevent a “reckless deal” and ensure “that there will be no negotiations at all.” He was speaking to members of Gvura, a right-wing organization representing the families of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza. But American officials described new urgency in reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said while meeting the families of Americans held hostage that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas. Alongside the strikes, the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the six hostages found dead, was held in Jerusalem on Monday. Speaking at the ceremony, Jon Goldberg-Polin said he hoped his son’s death would be “the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages.” “Hersh, we failed you. We all failed you. You would not have failed you. You would have pushed harder for justice,” he said. “You would have worked to understand the other, to bridge differences.” “The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing,” Goldberg-Polin said. “You were a really great guy. I love you.” Strike hits public services, schools As well as an impact on flights, some Israeli municipalities said they joined the strike, including Tel Aviv and Haifa, according to a list from the Histadrut outlining who joined the action as well as statements from some of the cities.

The captives, including an Israeli American , were among the more than 200 people taken by the militants into Gaza following their deadly cross-border rampage on October 7. Five of them were taken from an Israeli music festival where hundreds were killed and dozens more were kidnapped by Hamas fighters. The sixth was captured from a nearby farming community, according to the Hostages Families Forum, which has coordinated efforts to highlight the plight of the captives and their families, and push for their release. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said their bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The location was approximately one kilometer (0.6 miles) from the tunnel where another hostage was rescued alive days earlier, an IDF spokesperson added. Three of the six hostages whose bodies were recovered were expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of the “humanitarian category” based on the framework Israel and Hamas agreed to in early July, the officials said, with one of them adding: “Our Prime Minister delayed it.” Here’s what we know about the hostages: Hersh Goldberg-Polin Courtesy Goldberg-Polin family Hersh Goldberg-Polin The 23-year-old Israeli American became one of the most recognizable faces of the enduring hostage crisis, after he was taken at gunpoint by Hamas militants from the Nova music festival. Banners and murals demanding his return were often displayed in Jerusalem and around the world. When Hamas gunmen poured into southern Israel on October 7, Goldberg-Polin and his friends were forced to hide inside a small bomb shelter. As the militants began to lob grenades into the bunker, Goldberg-Polin rushed to throw them out, before his arm was blown off from the elbow down, according to a firsthand account from his friend. Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin, have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. They have also regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages and gave an emotional address at this month’s Democratic National Convention.

Testimonies indicate that Lobanov helped evacuate people at the festival and ran with five others into the Be’eri forest, where he was later captured by Hamas gunmen. Lobanov is survived by his wife and two children, a two-year-old and a five-month-old. His younger child was born while he was in captivity.

Be’eri was one of the hardest hit communities in the October 7 attacks with Hamas killing 101 of its residents, including children. Thirty people were abducted from the kibbutz that day. After 50 days without a sign of life, Gat’s family received testimony from returned hostages, who described her as their guardian angel.

Little wonder Saturday’s discovery of six hostages killed in Gaza has Israelis’ blood boiling. The nation feels on a cusp of a major turning point. Gripped by swelling protests and labor union strikes, the weeks ahead for Israel are unpredictable. These well-tested democratic tools of change have toppled governments before, but it’s best to remember that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a political survivor extraordinaire. Even now, Netanyahu and the hard-right nationalist members of his cabinet are working to shut down the legal protests and strikes through a court order, that seemed in the short term at least to have been successful. Yet despite the outcome being unclear, this tumultuous moment has been building for months. Galvanized by growing frustration waiting for Netanyahu to cut a deal with Hamas to bring home from Gaza the 101 remaining hostages, including 35 who are believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Prime Minister’s officer, it is Hamas, not surprisingly, that appears to be having a decisive say. Its leader Yahya Sinwar exploits every weakness in Netanyahu he can manipulate, the most potent of which is vulnerability to public opinion as Israel prepares to mark the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and some 250 others kidnapped and taken to Gaza. Protesters in Tel Aviv on September 1 block a road, calling for a deal for the immediate release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas militant group. Ariel Schalit/AP His moves may be calculated to weaken Netanyahu’s resolve, and they’re having a predictable impact. Unlike Palestinians in Gaza, Israelis can rise up to challenge their leadership. Late-night skirmishes between protesters and the authorities Sunday on Tel Aviv’s usually hyper-busy eight-lane Ayalon Highway were a manifestation of that. As flames and dense smoke engulfed wooden pallets and tires on the roads, I watched a young man, blue paint spray in hand, scrawl his message to the prime minister in foot-high letters on the roadside wall: “Hostages or revolt.” Nearby, two teenage girls speaking in well-articulated English told me they’d never been to a protest before, but the deaths of Goldberg-Polin and the five other hostages compelled them to come tonight. When I asked if they thought the protests would change the Netanyahu’s mind, without missing a beat, both told me they doubted it. It is a question gripping the nation, not least because the writing on the wall here has been wrong before. For many the protests and strikes cover well-trodden ground, tilted in favor of the government. Even Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s public condemnation of Netanyahu’s negotiating tactics, emotively calling him a “disgrace,” revisits previous rifts within the government.

Nir Elias/Pool/AFP/Getty Images Last year Netanyahu fired Gallant, for breaking with the government over highly contentious judicial reforms, before rehiring him shortly afterwards. The difference is that now, Gallant and the country are fighting several wars: Hamas in the south; a hostile enemy, Hezbollah, on their northern border; an alleged terror threat in the West Bank; not to mention a still unpaid threat of retaliation by Iran for the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran a month ago. Netanyahu’s multi-fronted challenges, like with so many spinning plates, need constant juggling. His unprecedented coalition cabinet is bounded by extreme-right nationalists, Security Minister Itmar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Above all others in his unruly cabinet, they are the pair who routinely threaten to collapse his coalition if he is seen as softening on Hamas. They owe their outsized influence to him, and would lose it if they topple him. Protesters fill a street in Tel Aviv, Israel, on September 1.

Bringing down Netanyahu would shoot them in the foot. It is why they are at the forefront of shutting down the strikes and protests. At the protests Sunday, as horseback police muscled their powerful mounts toward the crowds, many shouted to them: “We are not against you as individual police, only your boss Ben Gvir.” A measure of potential change will be how brave protesters feel against police emboldened by court orders Ben Gvir seeks to crack down on them and labor unions. How united the country’s potentially powerful unions remain in the face of government pressure to keep the country running will also show which side has the momentum.

Ilia Yefimovich/picture-alliance/dpa/AP So much is in the balance right now. Netanyahu’s short video message Sunday blaming Hamas for the death of the six and stalled hostage negotiations is indicative of his efforts to hunker down and limit damage to him. His unmatched political survival skills have kept him in office through bigger protests before, and few will be willing to bet he is about to throw in the towel now. The question is, how long can he hold on for? More days like Sunday, with the nation at the febrile intersection of heartache, frustration and anger, will challenge Netanyahu like never before. He is not just up against his usual enemies, the country’s liberal left, but in a fight-to-the-death tangle with the Hamas leader, who has made it clear that he is prepared engage in moments of unimaginable brutality to get what he wants. For Israel, the outlook is bleak: the chances of a cathartic hostage freedom moment are fading, along with Netanyahu’s political fortunes."

Anger at Netanyahu – who has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters – reached a boiling point Sunday as protesters responded in fury to the news that another six captives had been found killed in Gaza. Israel’s largest labor union called for a general strike on Monday and threatened to shut down the “entire Israeli economy.” The extent of the strike early Monday was not yet clear but supporters have vowed a national response. Three of the six hostages found dead, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had been expected to be released in an eventual ceasefire, Israeli officials told CNN. Autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning; Israeli forces announced the recovery of their bodies from an underground tunnel in Rafah on Saturday. The details of their deaths fueled anger that was palpable across the country as protesters blocked highways, waved Israeli flags, and chanted, “we won’t abandon them” in reference to the more than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, being held in Gaza, according to data from Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The vast majority of those hostages were taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive. In Tel Aviv, a group of protesters stood behind a mock cemetery while holding signs saying “named after Benjamin Netanyahu,” as they cast blame on the prime minister for the  deaths of the hostages. Later in the evening, police threw stun grenades at protesters blocking the Ayalon highway in the city, according to video verified by CNN. Naama Lazimi, a member of Israel’s parliament who was present at the demonstration, said on X that stun grenades “were thrown toward both sides where the demonstrators were standing in complete surprise and without any advance warning.” Israeli police also fired foam from a water cannon at protesters on the highway – prompting demonstrators to chant, “Officer, who are you keeping safe?” Police use water canon during the protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Tomer Appelbaum/Reuters Police arrested 29 people in the city, accusing them of vandalism, disorderly conduct and attacking officers. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said at least 700,000 people took part in protests across Israel, with an estimated 550,000 of them in Tel Aviv. CNN cannot independently verify the figures and has asked Israeli police to provide an estimation of the crowd size. In Tel Aviv, crowds were visibly emotional; many shouted “sorry” as the names of the six hostages were recited on a loudspeaker during the protest, which organizers said was the biggest since the start of the war. One protester told CNN said she was there to show support for her cousin, whose body was repatriated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) overnight. “I’m here every week, I wanted to show her father and other parents that we are here for them,” she said. “And on the other side, we’re incredibly angry at the government. What they’ve been doing is unforgivable.” In Jerusalem, protesters called for Netanyahu to resign as the government held a cabinet meeting. Eden Kramer, who attended the rally with a toddler in a stroller, said she was also demonstrating for the child’s future. “We hope everyone will come out today to bring a message to the government: We can’t keep up like this anymore,” she said. Protesters fill a street in Tel Aviv, Israel, on September 1. Or Adar Deal thrown into question The discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown negotiations for a deal into question. Skepticism has mounted over Netanyahu’s willingness to strike one given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far-right coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal. During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of a key border area known as the Philadelphi corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.” The Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7 mile) stretch that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. Netanyahu says control of the corridor is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it.

Gili Yaari/NurPhoto/Getty Images Gallant, who has increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned his colleagues Sunday that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.” He added, “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time.” A senior US official said the killings of the hostages called into question how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal as three of them were set to be released as part of the ceasefire agreement. “US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) and a number of the hostages who were just executed,” the senior US official said Sunday. “This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally.” A source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN it wasn’t clear how the killings would affect the discussions, adding that the impact will likely be seen in the next day or two. The “situation is complicated,” the source said. There are currently no in-person joint negotiations with the parties, but the source said discussions continue through the regular channels. US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House. ‘In a downward spiral’ Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has asked the country’s attorney general to request urgent injunctions to prevent the planned nationwide strike on Monday. In a letter addressed to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, Smotrich argued that a strike would hurt the economy during wartime and set a dangerous precedent. The attorney general’s office has not yet commented on the request. He had earlier instructed the finance ministry’s salary department to pass on a directive that anyone who joins the strike on Monday will not be paid. The chairman of Israel’s largest trade union, known as Histadrut, warned on Sunday that the country was “in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags.” Arnon Bar-David, who called for the strike, told a press conference that “only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down.” He added that the strike would include the shutdown of Ben-Gurion Airport. In a statement, Ben-Gurion Airport said it would be “open for flights and landings on Monday, September 2.” The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said it would join the strike, which it described as a “response to the tragic news of the murder of our student Carmel Gat, along with five other Israeli hostages.” Gat, a 40-year-old occupational therapist , was taken by Hamas from her parents’ home in the border kibbutz of Be’eri in southern Israel on October 7. A spokesperson for the university said the shutdown would be more extensive than previous measures taken since the beginning of the war, such as a partial strike in June.

Israeli soldiers found the six bodies in tunnels under the enclave, according to the military. The hostages were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Sunday. The development has sparked protests across Israel, with fresh public anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet for failing to secure a hostage deal. Israel’s largest trade union has also called for a nationwide strike starting Monday. Three of the six whose bodies were recovered had been expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of a “humanitarian category,” based on a framework agreed by Israel and Hamas in early July, the officials said. “Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.” The ordeal of California native Goldberg-Polin , who was taken at gunpoint at the Nova music festival on October 7, led to him becoming one of the faces of the devastating international hostage crisis that has challenged Netanyahu’s leadership and triggered widespread destruction in Gaza. The parents of 23-year-old Goldberg-Polin have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. Their tireless and high-profile campaigning saw them meet with world leaders, and earlier this month, give an emotional address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

The Israeli military named the other three victims as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov and Ori Danino. CNN is reaching out to their families. In a taped message Sunday, Netanyahu said he had been shocked to the core by what he said was “the terrible cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages.” He also stressed that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.” He said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas, and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December. “Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 – we agreed, and Hamas again refused.” He added that the Israeli government and he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.” In response, the Hostages Families Forum, a volunteer-based organization that represents relatives of those held captive, criticized the Prime Minister, calling on him to “stop blaming everyone” and to “take responsibility” for his alleged failures. “Take responsibility for the thwarting (of a deal). Take responsibility for the neglect. Take responsibility for the hostages who were murdered in captivity,” the Forum demanded in a statement. The Forum also said Netanyahu had ignored the views of the security establishment in insisting on conditions in the negotiations. “Hamas is not the only one responsible for the thwarting of the deal. We do not expect the terrorist (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar to want to return the hostages, we expect the Prime Minister of Israel to do everything, everything, everything in order to return the hostages home.” The Forum has called for demonstrations across Israel, while also announcing a vigil honoring the “hostages murdered in Gaza by Hamas” in Tel Aviv at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET). US President Joe Biden said the bodies of the hostages were recovered under the city of Rafah in southern Gaza. “I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House that also paid tribute to Goldberg-Polin’s parents. “They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,” Biden said. “They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.” Video Ad Feedback Hear what the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin said at the Democratic National Convention 08:14 - Source: CNN ‘Anguish and misery’ Goldberg-Polin’s death in particular will reverberate not just in Israel but in US political circles. His parents Rachel and Jonathan have regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages, and their emotional address to top Democrats at the convention earlier this month inextricably tied the hostages’ fate to US policy over the war in Gaza. Rachel Goldberg-Polin told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since her son was kidnapped. At her convention speech, she described life since October 7 as like living on “another planet.” “Anyone who is a parent or has had a parent can try to imagine the anguish and misery that Jon and I and all the hostage families are enduring,” she told delegates. Some of those discovered dead in the tunnels under Gaza this weekend were, like Goldberg-Polin, captured at the Nova music festival. Lobanov, a 32-year-old father of two, and Yerushalmi, 24, were both tending bar at the gathering, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Danino, 25, and Sarusi, 27, were also at the festival. Gat, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. She had been visiting her parents when Hamas militants stormed the community close to Gaza’s border, killing and taking hostages as they went.

Florion Goga/Reuters Anger in Israel News of more hostage deaths piles pressure on Netanyahu as anger inside Israel swells over the failure to strike a ceasefire deal, and as stark disagreements between the prime minister and his military leaders increasingly spill out into the open. A number of protests sparked across Israel on Sunday, with demonstrators’ anger directed at the government’s handling of the crisis. Protests have occurred or are ongoing in Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, Rehovot and Be’er Sheva. In several instances, protesters have blocked roads – demanding an immediate agreement to secure the remaining hostages’ release. The banner at one protest read: “Look them in the eyes.” The chairman of Israel’s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) Arnon Bar-David has also called for a nationwide general strike to begin on Monday at 6 a.m. local time, after holding a “charged and difficult” meeting with representatives of hostage families in Tel Aviv. “I will not tolerate the neglect,” Bar-David stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation of the hostages in Gaza. Histadrut is the country’s biggest labor union. “We are in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags. Only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down,” the labor leader said. The hostage deaths up the stakes for Biden to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict. “Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden said in his statement on Goldberg-Polin’s death. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said “the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces” by the news of the six dead. “On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,” Herzog said in a statement. “We will continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.” Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave. Anger has been growing inside Israel, led by many hostage families who believe Netanyahu and key far-right cabinet colleagues have been stalling on achieving a ceasefire resolution with Hamas that might bring those captured and killed home. Netanyahu has been adamant that a deal can only be signed when Israel’s safety is assured.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images But domestic pressure is building,  with the Hostages Families Forum being among the most critical of the Israeli prime minister. “The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,” the forum said in a statement in English on Sunday. “We call to Netanyahu: Stop hiding. Provide the public with a justification for this ongoing abandonment,” the forum added. Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.” “It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.” The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.

On October 7, he went to the Nova music festival in a rural area near the Gaza-Israel border with his best friend Aner to celebrate his 23rd birthday, according to his mother. “As rockets began to fall Hersh, Aner and 27 other young festival goers took refuge in a 5-feet-by-8-feet bomb shelter. Terrorists began to throw grenades into the shelter, Aner stood in the doorway and repelled seven of those grenades before the eighth one killed him,” Rachel Goldberg-Polin said. Demonstrators at a protest in Tel Aviv on August 31 call for the release of Israelis held hostage by Palestinian militants in Gaza since October.

He was later taken on a truck by gunmen and driven off, eyewitnesses told his parents. Footage taken on the day of that attack showed Goldberg-Polin being marched out of the shelter – with his hand blown off and bone protruding from his wrist – and thrown along with four others into the back of a truck. The first time Goldberg-Polin’s parents saw that video was following an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in October. The pair were recalling eyewitness accounts of how their son was taken into captivity during a live TV interview, when Cooper realized he had heard details of the story before. Days earlier, an Israeli soldier at the site of the Nova festival had shown Cooper the video. During the interview, Cooper realized the young man in the video was his interviewees’ son. Not wanting to spring the news on them on live TV, Cooper contacted the couple after the interview and asked if they wanted to see the video. They later confirmed the man in the video was their son and asked that the video be shared more widely. The latest hostage deaths up the stakes for the Biden administration to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict. It also puts pressure on Netanyahu to agree a deal as fears grow that more captives will die and the ongoing destruction in Gaza could spark a wider regional war. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave. “There is a surplus of agony on all sides of the tragic conflict in the Middle East in a competition of pain. There are no winners,” Jonathan Polin said at the DNC last month. “In an inflamed Middle East we know the one thing that can most immediately release pressure and bring calm to the entire region. A deal that brings this diverse group of 109 hostages home and ends the suffering of the innocent civilians in Gaza. The time is now.” This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

The demands by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum came as thousands rallied across Israel on Saturday demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sign a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. The IDF said in a statement Saturday that it had “located a number of bodies during combat in the Gaza Strip,” but it has not confirmed whether any of the bodies are those of hostages and asked the public to “refrain from spreading rumors.” However, many Israelis have taken the statement to mean that more Israeli hostages have been found dead and it has amplified calls for the government to secure a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave. “Netanyahu abandoned the hostages! This is now a fact,” a statement issued by the families’ forum read. “Starting tomorrow the country will tremble. We call on the public to prepare. We will stop the country,” the statement continued. The forum said it will release more details about what it is calling for on Sunday. US President Joe Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials about the unfolding situation but noted that the bodies had not yet been identified. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.” “It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.” The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

Abir Sultan/Pool/Reuters/File Related article Netanyahu clashes with defense minister over Gaza deal terms, Israeli media reports say The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase. However, the current proposal, if agreed upon, essentially allows Israel and Hamas to abandon discussions after the first phase, and Israel has made it clear that a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire. More than 100 hostages taken from Israel were freed under a temporary truce last year and eight have been rescued alive – including Farhan Al-Qadi , who was recovered from a Hamas tunnel this week. However, more than 100 are thought to remain in Gaza. CNN previously reported that there are 107 total hostages, living and dead, being held in Gaza, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Of that number, 103 hostages are from the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Of those, 33 are presumed dead, according to the forum. This is a developing story and will be updated."

His eyes were glassy, often seeming tired. The Israeli military said Tuesday that Al-Qadi is the eighth hostage to be rescued alive in Gaza by the Israeli military since the beginning of the war – but he is the first to have been reclaimed alive from inside Hamas’ tunnel network underneath Gaza Al-Qadi sat at the center of long rows of plastic chairs, where visitors greeted him with long embraces and kisses on the cheek in a gathering near Tarabin – one of Israel’s many unrecognized Bedouin villages. Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi Hostages Families Forum Related article ‘Brought back to life’: Family hails rescue of Israeli hostage from Hamas tunnel in Gaza With limited power and water services, the village is about 20 miles from the Gaza Strip and is not protected by Israel’s Iron Dome defense system. The closest city is Rahat, which is the largest Arab Bedouin city in Israel. The Bedouin community – a Muslim, semi-nomadic, and ethnically Arab group – is considered a subset of Israel’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population. While some identify as Bedouin Israelis, others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. Unlike Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to volunteer, often serving in specialized units like the Gadsar 585 , known as the Bedouin battalion, which operates in the Negev desert, where most Bedouins originate. ‘Isolated alone’ From the village, CNN’s team on the ground could hear heavy strikes and impacts from the nearby Gaza Strip. Fayez Sohaiban, Al-Qadi’s relative and the former mayor of Rahat city, said the former hostage had lived in captivity not knowing what his fate would be the next day, and food “was almost nonexistent.” Al-Qadi was working as a security guard in Kibbutz Magen when he was taken 11 months ago. He told reporters on Wednesday that he spent a lot of his time in a tunnel, and had not seen the sky for eight months before his rescue. He added that he did not meet other hostages during his time in Gaza. “No one, no. Not once,” his brother, Juma’a, said, adding that Al-Qad was “isolated alone” the entire time. Ali El-Ziyadne, whose brother and nephew were also kidnapped on October 7 and remain in Gaza, joined the Bedouin community to welcome Al-Qadi home. His brother, Youssef Ziyadne, and nephew, Hamza Ziyadne, have been held hostage by Hamas for 11 months, he said. “We are afraid for their lives. We don’t know anything about them,” El-Ziyadne told CNN, adding that Youssef suffers from diabetes. El-Ziyadne said he pleaded several times to Hamas that they release his relatives, who are Muslim, hoping to appeal to the group’s “Islamic values and humanity.” El-Ziyadne asked about his brother and nephew when he met Al-Qadi, but the former hostage did not see them, he said. Bedouin Israeli former hostage Al-Qadi, whose rescue from the Gaza Strip was announced by the Israeli army on Tuesday, is welcomed by his relatives in Karkor village of Beer Sheva, Israel, on August 28, 2024. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images/File Before Israel’s founding in 1948, the Negev was home to 92,000 Bedouins, but only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war of that year, according to Minority Rights Group . Those who stayed “were treated harshly, uprooted time and again and forced to live in reservations,” the international human rights organization said. Today, Bedouin in the Negev still struggle to exercise basic human rights to water, shelter and education, according to Minority Rights Group, which blames Israeli authorities for withholding essential services from Bedouin villages it does not recognize. Tens of thousands of Bedouin live in such villages, where they face the threat of home demolition, eviction or forced displacement, the group estimates. According to the National Library of Israel , there are almost 250,000 Bedouins, many of whom live in towns that are yet to receive recognition from the state, while others live in unincorporated villages. Al-Qadi’s rescue means there are now 103 hostages from the October 7 attack being held in Gaza, according to figures from the Israeli prime minister’s office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Last week the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from Gaza during an overnight military operation in Khan Younis, Israeli authorities said. Hopes of a ceasefire-for-hostages deal, which would halt fighting in Gaza and see the return of people held by Hamas, have repeatedly been raised and dashed in recent months. Negotiators are continuing to work on a deal, and have met with increasing intensity in recent weeks. Talks made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the discussions in Cairo, Egypt, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement. An Israeli delegation is expected to head to Doha on Wednesday for ceasefire talks.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/middleeast/gaza-who-humanitarian-pause-intl-latam/index.html,Israel agrees to pauses in fighting in Gaza for polio vaccination,"Since the war, Gaza’s near-universal polio vaccine coverage has dropped to just over 80%, potentially endangering thousands of children.","Sep 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Tara John,Middle East,"CNN — Israel has agreed to a series of pauses in fighting in Gaza in September to allow young children in the enclave to be vaccinated for polio, according to United Nations and Israeli officials. The polio campaign, which will aim to vaccinate around 640,000 children across Gaza, comes after the highly infectious virus was found in sewage samples in the Strip in June. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative for the West Bank and Gaza, told a press briefing from a video link Thursday that the pause would start September 1 and will be split into three 3-day phases. “We have a preliminary commitment for area-specific humanitarian pauses during the campaign,” he said, adding that the pauses will roll out first in “central Gaza for three days, followed by south Gaza and then followed by north Gaza.” The vaccination drive comes as aid agencies reported Israeli attacks on their convoys. One charity said an Israeli strike on a humanitarian vehicle in Gaza killed several employees of a transportation company. The Israeli military said it targeted “armed men” who had taken over the convoy. The return of polio to Gaza is a measure of the destruction wrought by more than 10 months of Israeli bombardment. Polio vaccine coverage in the enclave was estimated at 99% in 2022, but had dropped to below 90% at the start of this year, according to WHO data. Peeperkorn warned that more than 90% coverage was needed to stop the outbreak. Abdul Rahman is the first person in Gaza in 25 years to be diagnosed with polio. CNN Related article Polio vaccines are coming to Gaza, but for this baby boy, its first case in 25 years, they’re too late The virus mostly affects children under five years old, and can cause irreversible paralysis and even death. It’s highly infectious and there is no cure; it can only be prevented by immunization, WHO says. More than 2,000 health workers have been recruited in Gaza to take part in the ambitious vaccination campaign. So far, 1.26 million doses of vaccines have been delivered to the Strip, with 400,000 more on their way. An Israeli official confirmed to CNN that polio vaccinations will begin in Gaza on Sunday. Each phase of the vaccination campaign is expected to take around seven hours, and during those hours, the vaccines will be able enter the area on “pause” and be distributed. Vaccinations will begin in the central Deir Al-Balah region from September 1 to 4, then in the southern Khan Younis region from September 5 to 8, and in Gaza City and northern Gaza from September 9 to 12, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah said. The ministry also published maps showing the locations of each vaccination center. A source familiar with the vaccination rollout told CNN that the major challenge will be whether IDF soldiers on the ground honor the pauses in fighting. There are concerns that they will not, the source said, adding that the IDF’s standard operating procedure is to go after a Hamas target no matter what. Hamas knows about the pauses and is expected to take advantage of them to move critical personnel and assets. The work now is to make sure the Israeli soldiers know that they cannot engage militarily during the pause, the source said. Very little is known about the epidemiological profile of this strain of polio – the working assumption is that 500 people in Gaza are carrying it, the source added. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said two doses of vaccine will be given in two rounds, four weeks apart – suggesting that further pauses may be arranged later. Peeperkorn warned, however, that due to the damage to roads, infrastructure and the constant displacement of people caused by Israel’s assault, “conducting the campaign for just three days in each area is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve adequate vaccination coverage.” A worker unloads a shipment of polio vaccines through the Karm Abu Salem crossing at a Gaza health ministry depot, on Sunday. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, said the militant group welcomed the push for a pause in Gaza to implement the vaccination drive. “We are ready to cooperate with international organizations to secure this campaign,” he added. Earlier this month, Abdul Rahman, an 11-month-old boy, was diagnosed with the disease – Gaza’s first recorded case of polio in 25 years. His mother, Niveen Abu al-Jidyan, told CNN how her child went from feverish and vomiting to partially paralyzed. “My child started to move and crawl at an early age. But suddenly everything went backwards. Suddenly, he was no longer crawling or moving or able to stand on his feet or even sit,” she said. “He will be one next month. He should be walking by now, but he suddenly stopped moving.” Israel’s offensive not yet relenting Ahead of the expected pauses, Israel’s offensive in Gaza has continued. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had carried out an airstrike on a humanitarian aid convoy in Rafah, which it claimed had been taken over by armed men. Anera, the US-based charity that organized the convoy said several employees of the transport company it was working with were killed in the strike. Sandra Rasheed, Anera’s country director for Palestine, told CNN the convoy was carrying medical supplies and fuel to the Emirati Red Crescent hospital in Gaza and condemned the “shocking incident.” The IDF said it launched the strike after it had confirmed “that only the vehicle of the armed men could be attacked,” adding that the Anera employees had reached their destination “safe and sound.” A photo released by World Food Program shows multiple bullet pock marks in the drivers’ side window; in total, at least ten bullets hit the vehicle, according to the agency. World Food Program Related article World Food Programme halts movement in Gaza after repeated gunfire strikes aid vehicle In a later statement, Anera said four Palestinians had been killed in the airstrike. No Anera staff were injured but one of its employees, in the second vehicle of the convoy, witnessed the incident at close range. Anera said that shortly after the convoy left the Kerem Shalom crossing, “four community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security” with the transport company had asked to take command of the first vehicle, “citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted.” The NGO said the Israeli airstrike had been carried out “without any prior warning or communication.” In a separate incident, the World Food Programme (WFP), which delivers aid throughout the Strip, said on Wednesday it is halting the movement of its employees after one of its vehicles, which it said was “clearly marked,” was targeted with repeated gunfire just meters from an Israeli checkpoint. On Friday, US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations said an Israeli investigation into the attack had found it was caused by a “communications error.” CNN has asked the Israeli military for more information. Kate Phillips-Barrasso, the vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian group, told CNN Thursday that the success of the Gaza polio vaccination campaign “rests on real and reliable guarantees of safety — ones that have not been provided by the parties to this conflict over the last ten months.” “Put simply, Gaza has become the most dangerous place in the world to be a child or a humanitarian worker,” she said. Three-day periods ‘might not be enough’ WHO representative Peeperkorn said that as the three-day periods might not be enough to reach all those targeted, it “has been agreed, when needed, the campaign will be extended by one day per zone, or even more when necessary.” The Hostages Families Forum, which campaigns for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, has also asked the WHO and the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, to include the hostages in the ongoing polio vaccination campaign and all other health interventions. A United States official told CNN that Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in their meeting last week on the polio vaccinations, telling Netanyahu it had to be a top priority and it had to get done. Netanyahu agreed to work with the US on the details, the official said. US Special Envoy Lise Grande for Middle East Humanitarian Issues has been leading that effort, working to finalize the details between the Israeli government and the UN, including what the pauses would like and how the vaccines would be delivered. WHO is joined in the vaccination effort by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and other partners. Each organization has been assigned a role in the technical and strategic “microplan” to execute the vaccine campaign. For weeks, the organizations have emphasized that some kind of ceasefire — what they are calling a “polio pause”— would be crucial to the effort’s success, and even to contain the disease from spreading to the broader region.

The IDF posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday that people who had been ordered to leave three neighborhoods of Deir Al Balah in central Gaza could go home. CNN interviewed a number of families who had returned to find scenes of destruction. One man, Abdulfattah Al Bourdaini, said: “We came home and found nothing, no power, no gas, no house, and we cannot change our clothes.” All he had been able to salvage was a teddy bear for the son he hoped one day to have. “I am penniless like the day I was born,” Al Bourdaini said. “I have nothing. I came to check on my house, didn’t find a house or anything, nothing is left… There is nothing left to cry about.” His brother, Musa Al Bourdaini, surveyed the scene in disbelief, telling CNN: “Why would they want to destroy this house? This house could have housed 120 people… What did they do to the house? They didn’t find a single human being in it, but yet they hit it with missiles and destroyed an entire neighborhood.” A worker unloads a shipment of polio vaccines provided with support from UNICEF to the Gaza Strip through the Karm Abu Salem crossing at a depot belonging to Gaza's health ministry on August 25. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images Related article Israel agrees to pauses in fighting in Gaza for polio vaccination He said he had come home with a key to his own, neighboring building – but had found no house for it. “Now we will bring a tent, that is if we find a tent, and put it next to our house,” he added. Several people said they had been displaced from the neighborhood about 10 days ago, when the Israeli military posted on X and dropped leaflets telling people to evacuate the area for their own security. Many Gaza residents have been displaced multiple times since October, worsening the ongoing humanitarian crisis; experts also warn that evacuation orders have complicated aid efforts. In its post on X on Thursday, the IDF said that “following the operations against terror organizations in the (Deir Al Balah) area, the IDF is enabling the return to these blocks which are part of the designated Humanitarian Area.” On Friday, the IDF announced that people in three more blocks in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza could also return home, saying on X: “‎After the IDF’s activities against terrorist organizations in the area, you can return to these blocks. In the meantime, the humanitarian zone will be adapted and those areas will from now on be classified as part of the humanitarian zone.” In a statement Friday detailing its operations in recent weeks, the Israeli military said “troops of the 98th Division have completed their divisional operation in the Khan Younis and Deir Al Balah area, after about a month of simultaneous above and underground operational activity.” Israeli forces had “eliminated over 250 terrorists,” and destroyed terrorist infrastructure including six underground tunnel routes in the course of the operation, the statement said. “In some of the tunnel routes the troops eliminated terrorists and located terrorist hideouts and weapons.” The Israeli military has told residents of some Gaza neighborhoods that they can return home but many have found scenes of destruction. Mohammad Al Sawalhi/CNN Abdul Raouf Radwan said that he and his family had moved into a tent closer to the coast to escape the bombardment. They had returned hoping to reoccupy their home, “hoping to find a life, find something, find a room to live in,” he said. “We found nothing but destruction. Our dreams were destroyed, our memories were destroyed… The house that our ancestors built was all gone.” His brother, Muhammad Ramzi Radwan, said he had already lost a son as a result of the Israeli military’s operations. “A young man of 30, who built himself up from scratch, education, marriage, a son. All is gone, nothing is left.” “My message is to stop the war,” Radwan said. “There is no time left to rebuild ourselves… We have endured this. This is beyond our capacity.” Yamen al Tabi’s house was also destroyed. He said the family had left the neighborhood out of fear and returned to find their home completely ruined. “I wish I had been buried in the house. I wish I had died in the house and not returned and seen the scene that I saw,” he told CNN. “Where will we go now without shelter?” Raouf Ayesh said he and his children had taken refuge in tents. “And we said, ‘Oh God, let us return to our homes and find our belongings, our clothes, our winter clothes.” But they returned to nothing but debris. Ayesh appeared to place some of the blame on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. “Let Sinwar be satisfied,” he said. “Can you hear? They ruined us. We were not like this.” Some Palestinians returning to devastated neighborhoods say they can only try to salvage what they can from their former homes. Mohammad Al Sawalhi/CNN Hanan Al-Arabeed, a widow who had returned to her home with her children, found it in ruins. “Should I go to a tent I am now in the street, I have two disabled children. I did not take anything with me from my house, there is total destruction as you can see,” ﻿she said. Al-Arabeed had harsh words for Arab governments, saying: “We demand that the Arab countries stand with us, they make us feel that we are not Muslims…. The negotiations are at whose expense? At the expense of the martyrs, at the expense of the blood of children that is wasted.” Her sister, Umm Kareem Al-Arabeed, said she was collecting whatever she could from the ruins of her apartment. “Unfortunately, Israel has made its decision to eliminate the Gaza Strip. Indeed, it wants to eliminate the Palestinian people so that they do not raise their heads from here for 100 years. But you know, we are a steadfast people, coping people,” she said. “We will start from the beginning and anew. We will start over,” she added. Nearly 84% of the enclave has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war, according to the United Nations’ main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, UNRWA. All the while, the Israel-designated “humanitarian zone” has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis."

The two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor , a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, according to CNN affiliate Channel 12, the Times of Israel and other outlets. The Philadelphi corridor is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. According to multiple accounts, Netanyahu produced maps showing how the IDF should remain in the corridor during the first phase of the deal – in which hostages are also meant to be released – so as to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels under the corridor. “I would like to bring the decision on the IDF troops remaining in the Philadelphi Corridor for the Cabinet’s approval,” Netanyahu is reported to have said. Gallant interjected, according to the accounts of the meeting, saying: “The significance of this is that Hamas won’t agree to it, so there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.” Mohammad Al Sawalhi/CNN Related article ‘Nothing is left’: Israel’s military tells Gaza residents to go home but they find only rubble He also alleged that Netanyahu had drawn up different maps to those preferred by Israeli negotiators in Cairo, adding: “You imposed these maps on them.” Netanyahu angrily rejected the claim, but Gallant persisted. “Of course you forced (it). You’re running the negotiations on your own. Since you disbanded the War Cabinet, we hear everything after the fact.” Gallant appeared to receive support from the Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi, who was at the meeting. He is reported to have said that the IDF could withdraw from the corridor and return “at the end of six weeks of ceasefire. There are enough constraints for negotiations, there’s no need to add another one.” According to published accounts, Gallant said at one point that “the prime minister can indeed make all the decisions, and he can also decide to kill all the hostages,” provoking rebukes from other ministers. He added that “30 lives are at stake.” Gallant added that “in the end Sinwar will dictate to you and you’ll retract,” a reference to the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who is thought to be in hiding in Gaza. Netanyahu in response reportedly insisted that no one dictated to him, saying that “only determined negotiation will make him (Sinwar) fold.” The cabinet proceeded to vote on the maps that Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, the only dissenter being Gallant. The right-wing National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir abstained from the vote. Israeli media cited sources close to him as saying he opposed any gradual decrease in the number of soldiers in the corridor. An Israeli official told CNN on Saturday that they were unable to comment on the maps presented to the meeting but confirmed Netanyahu asked the cabinet to hold a vote on forces remaining in the Philadelphi corridor. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum responded to the media reports of the meeting with a statement that they “should cause every Israeli citizen to lose sleep.” West Bank incidents Reports of the dispute between top Israeli officials emerged as violence continues to rock the Israeli- occupied West Bank . Two security incidents happened overnight on Friday, in which two men were shot dead and a vehicle exploded, according to the IDF.

Here’s what to know The IDF said that a vehicle caught fire and exploded late Friday at a gas station at the Gush Etzion intersection. “Forces that arrived at the point shot and killed the terrorist who got out of the vehicle and tried to attack them.” The IDF said that nearby, “terrorists tried to run over a security guard at the entrance to the settlement of Karmei Tzur,” a settlement north of the city of Hebron. One of them was killed. The IDF said there had been several casualties in the two incidents. The Israeli emergency services (MDA) said that shortly before midnight it received a report of two gunshot victims near the gas station. The victims were moderately injured with gunshot wounds. The MDA said that a vehicle apparently breached the entrance to the Karmei Tzur community. The head of security at the settlement received minor injuries when pursuing the vehicle, according to the IDF, and “during the confrontation, an explosive device in the terrorist’s car detonated.” The Palestine Islamic Jihad movement said its fighters were responsible for the attacks and claimed without offering evidence that a number of Israeli soldiers had been killed. The IDF said Saturday that security forces continue searches for additional suspects near Karmei Tzur community. “The initial examination of the vehicle explosion at the Gush Etzion gas station indicated that the incident was an attempted car bombing by a terrorist,” it said. Several soldiers had received light or moderate injuries, it said. The Israeli army blocks all entrances to the city of Hebron on Saturday. Mamoun Wazwaz/Anadolu/Getty Images The incidents come amid a substantial Israeli operation in the West Bank over the past few days which the IDF has said is targeting militants preparing attacks on Israel. In the north of the West Bank, Israel’s military is continuing its offensive in Jenin city and refugee camp for a fourth consecutive day, Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Saturday, citing local sources. It said eyewitnesses claimed Israeli military reinforcements had been deployed to the Jenin refugee camp and raided several homes. “Israeli military bulldozers have been destroying streets and infrastructure in both the city and the refugee camp, causing significant damage to electricity and water networks,” WAFA reported. Videos obtained by CNN on Saturday appear to show Israeli military bulldozers digging up streets in Jenin refugee camp on Saturday. The IDF says this is done to find and dismantle explosive devices.

Sign up here. Rosh Pina and Kibbutz Magal, Israel CNN — With one year left until graduation, 17-year-old Ziv Zinger hopes to begin the academic year on September 1 like other students across Israel. But that hope remains uncertain for him and others from the country’s Northern District, who are grappling with the reality of displacement as Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon drags on without resolution. He is among more than a thousand students who, before the October 7 war, attended the Har VaGai Regional High School in the Dafna kibbutz (agricultural commune), less than two miles from the border with Lebanon. The school was forced to shut when Israel ordered border communities to evacuate as the Israeli military and Hezbollah began exchanging fire. Just last month, a rocket burst through the empty school’s gym. Some 62,000 Israelis have been displaced from their homes in the north of the country since the evacuation order almost a year ago. Zinger said he feels “cheated” by not being able to return to his school in Dafna. After October 7, schools shut for a month, he said, after which students spent the rest of the academic year in hybrid learning that alternated between online classes and other school locations. 17-year-old Ziv Zinger looks on during an interview with CNN in the town of Rosh Pina, Israel on August 22. Dan Hodge/CNN “(I) feel very connected to the old school,” he told CNN. Students had access to “grass, a river flowing through the school. It was very open.” Hezbollah said its attacks are in response to Israel’s war in Gaza, which was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has killed more than 40,600 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. The Israel-Hezbollah crossfire extending several kilometers into both countries’ territory, along with the subsequent evacuation order in Israel, has impacted more than 16,000 Israeli students, the country’s ministry of education said.

Aziz Taher/Reuters Related article Israel launches ‘preemptive’ strikes in Lebanon as Hezbollah fires back hundreds of rockets Across the border in Lebanon, where authorities say more than 94,000 people have been displaced, at least 70 schools have closed with around 20,000 students affected, according to UNICEF . The country’s education system was already “on the brink of collapse” before the conflict due to years of being overstretched, it said. As Lebanon faced a crippling economic crisis, public school teachers went on a months-long strike in late 2022, leaving classrooms empty. The war has only compounded the situation. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel started just a day before the Lebanese academic year was to start, leaving schools and teachers unable to find immediate alternatives, Khaled Al-Fayed, an official at the Lebanese education ministry, was cited as saying by Asharq Al Awsat newspaper. The government eventually made arrangements to move students to schools in safer areas and made distance learning available to those who were trapped in their villages. Maysoun Chehab, UNESCO’s chief of education for Lebanon, told The National newspaper however that bad internet connectivity, the lack of electronic devices in some homes and inadequate teacher training are major hurdles for distance learning in the country. Twenty-two children have died in Lebanon from Israeli strikes since October, according to the ministry of health. Makeshift schools in Israel South of Israel’s evacuation zone, makeshift schools are now emerging nearly 11 months into the war as part of an effort to return children to classrooms. In the northern town of Rosh Pina, some 46 kilometers (27 miles) from the Lebanon border, an empty factory is being repurposed to accommodate students of Har VaGai, where Zinger was a student for three years. He’s glad a new school is being built for them, but said it won’t “feel like home.” Spanning some 17 acres, the three-building factory is being revamped to accommodate more than 1,000 students, Ravit Rosental, principal of the school, told CNN. Despite the efforts to move the students to relative safety, fears persist. The makeshift school is outside the evacuation zone but it’s still within range of Hezbollah’s projectiles. It is equipped with 18 external bomb shelters, as well as several safe rooms within each building. “We are afraid. I cannot say that I am not afraid,” Rosental said. Children riding on school buses in the area are at risk of being hit by rockets, missiles, drones or even failed interceptions, she said. “We have a lot of problems on the roads,” she said. Sirens blared across the unfinished school just a day before CNN’s visit, according to Palestinian workers at the site, who showed videos of the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepting projectiles in the sky. Rosental told CNN that she is “not so confident” that the school will be operational by September 1. The war shows no signs of abating. In a fresh round of escalation, the Israeli military launched what it called “preemptive” strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon on Sunday, as the Iran-backed militant group said it carried out its own attacks in response to the killing of a top commander. In a video statement that day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “what happened today is not the end,” while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that further strikes could be carried out against Israel. ‘Russian roulette’ with children’s lives Officials in the north of the country fear their district may never return to normalcy. “We are playing Russian roulette with the lives of our children,” Amit Sofer, the head of the Merom HaGalil Council in northern Israel, told Israeli news outlet Ynet . “There is no protection, there is no security,” he said, adding that “in the current situation, I don’t see the education system resuming on the conflict line.” Pressure has been mounting on the Israeli government to restore security in the north, bring evacuees home and resume the new academic year on time.

Dan Hodge/CNN Far-right ministers of the ruling coalition have been pushing Netanyahu not only to press on with the war in Gaza, but to launch a “ decisive war ” against Hezbollah as well. Some officials in the north share that sentiment. Mayors from the Northern District have threatened to cut contact with Netanyahu’s government unless their demands are met. “For eleven months there has been a security strip within the territory of the State of Israel and the government is silent,” David Azoulay, the head of the Metula settlement council in the north, said in a statement. “Soon, another sad school year outside our homes and the government is silent.” Azoulay said he wanted to see the government “act physically” and “act to remove the threat and return us to our homes.” Hezbollah has vowed to continue attacking the Jewish state until Israel stops its war in Gaza. Israel’s northern front was a point of contention in Netanyahu’s war cabinet before it was disbanded in June. The prime minister had reportedly told the cabinet that September 1 did not have to be the “goal date” to start the school year, according to Israel’s Channel 12. “Why do we keep taking about this date, what will happen if they go back a few months later?” the prime minister reportedly said in response to pressure from former war cabinet member Benny Gantz to stick to the official date, according to Channel 12. CNN has reached out to the prime minister’s office for comment.

Oren Ziv/AFP/Getty Images Related article Israelis fear for hostages as Netanyahu celebrates ‘crushing blows’ against enemies Asked if the school year would resume on time, the Israeli education ministry told CNN that “the Northern District is prepared and ready to receive students and to start the school year as scheduled,” but that “should the security situation worsen, we will issue appropriate instructions to the schools accordingly.” Parents of students who are forced to attend new schools say they hope their children experience a sense of normalcy soon. Meirav Atmor, mother of 12-year-old Matan, said her son is longing to return to school, but that the war brings daily anxieties. “It’s very stressful when there are sirens,” Matan told CNN, sitting next to his mother in their home in Rosh Pina, adding that he has had to learn where shelters are and how to take cover when needed. The war has had a huge effect on both parents and their children, Atmor said. It is “not normal” for a mother to be worried about the impact of war on her son, she said. “It is not a normal reality for a young boy to deal with,” she added. “And that’s sad. That’s very sad.” Zinger, the 17-year-old, said it has been a rough year for him. While previous generations in Israel have experienced war, for many young Israelis like him, it’s a new and unsettling experience. “(For) everyone my age, this is the first real war,” he said, adding that the even younger generation will be forced to grow up “in the reality of war.” “People’s lives have been changed.” CNN’s Dana Karni and Lauren Izso contributed to this report."

The victims were all local Palestinians involved with a transportation company contracted by Anera, according to the organization. They had decided to ride in the lead vehicle for the convoy’s security but had not been cleared by Israeli authorities, it also said. Shortly after the convoy left the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Thursday, “four community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security” with the Move One transport company took control of the lead vehicle, “citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted,” Anera said. The humanitarian convoy’s mission and route had been coordinated with Israeli authorities, however, the Israel Defense Forces said it attacked the lead car because the men inside appeared to be armed – a breach of the agreed plan. “After further confirmation that only the vehicle of the armed men could be attacked, an attack was carried out on them,” the IDF said in a statement Thursday.

Anera has said that the convoy’s transport plan called for unarmed security guards, and that the people who were killed had not been approved in advance. Humanitarian workers typically coordinate their routes with Israeli forces in order to move with relative safety. “The four community members were neither vetted nor coordinated in advance, and Israeli authorities allege that the lead car was carrying numerous weapons,” Anera said. The airstrike, which Anera said was carried out without any prior warning, did not injure any of its staff. One employee, who was in the second vehicle of the aid convoy, “witnessed the incident at close range,” it said. “Despite this devastating incident, our understanding is that the remaining vehicles in the convoy were able to continue and successfully deliver the aid to the hospital. We are urgently seeking further details about what happened,” Anera’s Palestine country director, Sandra Rasheed, told CNN. The mission was carrying carry food and fuel to the Emirati Red Crescent Hospital in the south of Gaza. Anera has coordinated 24 prior shipments for the hospital with the United Arab Emirates since May. The strike comes just days after a World Food Programme convoy was attacked close to an Israeli checkpoint, sustaining “at least ten bullets,” according to the UN agency. The incident prompted the United Nations to lodge a formal complaint with Israel, and the IDF is currently reviewing the incident. A photo released by World Food Program shows multiple bullet pock marks in the drivers’ side window; in total, at least ten bullets hit the vehicle, according to the agency.

The airstrikes hit three cars in their convoy, killing three Britons, a Palestinian, a US-Canadian dual citizen, an Australian, and a Pole. Pressure is mounting on Hamas, which governs Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seal a ceasefire and hostage release deal against the backdrop of severe starvation , dire water shortages , mass displacement and disease in the enclave. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed over 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 93,500 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in the isolated enclave after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli special forces, acting on intelligence, were combing a network of tunnels in southern Gaza when they found Al-Qadi, two Israeli military officials told CNN. Al-Qadi was alone, without his Hamas captors, when Israeli forces found him, one of the officials said. Al-Qadi is the eighth hostage to be rescued alive in Gaza by the Israeli military since the beginning of the war, in four separate operations – but he is the first to have been reclaimed alive from inside Hamas’ tunnel network underneath Gaza, the IDF told CNN. “He was dead and is now brought back to life,” Al-Qadi’s brother, Juma’a, told CNN after Al-Qadi met family members at the Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, where he is being cared for following his rescue. He added that his brother had not expected to come back alive. “It was all tears. Tears of joy. What matters is that we saw him,” Juma’a said during an interview in the Bedouin village of Tarabin, in Israel’s Negev desert. He added that his brother had told him earlier today that his one wish was to “see you (the family) and then die.” CNN Related article Who are the hostages freed during the Israel-Hamas conflict? A friend of Al-Qadi, Mazen Abu Siam described jubilant scenes and a “big celebration” at the hospital, where “hundreds of friends and relatives” had arrived to visit the former hostage. Al-Qadi was discharged from hospital on Wednesday afternoon, the Soroka Medical Center said. In a press briefing, Al-Qadi expressed his gratitude to the soldiers who rescued him and the medical team at Soroka, the same hospital where he was born. Already making use of his new freedom, he said “I got shawarma at 2 a.m.” Family members told CNN he is expected to return to Tarabin on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening, his brothers and 11 children, along with their cousins and neighbors, were busy putting up tents, chairs and lights ahead of his return to the village. In the closed women’s quarters of the village, Al-Qadi’s mother was awaiting her son’s return. Alya El-Sanae said that at first, her family hid the painful truth behind her son’s disappearance, telling her he was traveling. A few months after the October 7 attacks, she was told her son was held by Hamas in Gaza. Today, news of his release felt “unbelievable.” “My heart flew with joy,” El-Sanae told CNN. Gomaa, one of the brothers of the rescued hostage Farhan Al-Qadi, speaks to the media after leaving his brother’s room at the hospital in Beer Sheva. CNN ‘It is hard for him to erase the things he saw’ Juma’a said that his brother had been shot in the leg and kidnapped on October 7, during an attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Juma’a added that his brother’s leg appeared poorly treated and that he was operated on without anesthesia, “as one does with animals.” The 11 months Al-Qadi spent in captivity would never leave him, Juma’a said. “It is hard for him to erase the things he saw there,” Juma’a said, adding that he too would never fully recover from losing his brother for nearly a year. Ata Abu Madighem, the former mayor of the Arab Bedouin city of Rahat in southern Israel, close to where Al-Qadi is from, said he had visited Al-Qadi in hospital. He said Al-Qadi had told him another hostage died next to him at the beginning of his captivity. “He told me that captivity was brutal. Constant darkness, did not see the light of day. He was treated like the rest of the hostages, like an Israeli in every way,” he said. Another one of Al-Qadi’s brothers, Abu Mohammad, suggested to CNN that his captors had fled when they heard Israeli troops approaching the tunnels, saying his brother had heard Hebrew voices and shouted out to communicate his whereabouts. Asked by CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday if he believes Al-Qadi’s captors abandoned him, IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said that was “one of the options that are being looked at.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Al-Qadi, in a conversation released on video by his office. “Farhan, I am so happy to talk to you,” Netanyahu says in the video. I want you to know that we do not forget anyone, just as we did not forget you.” “I’m happy too. I’ve been waiting for this moment,” the former hostage told the prime minister. The Hostages Families Forum, which campaigns for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, celebrated the return of the father of 11. Al-Qadi, right, is pictured in an Israeli hospital with one of his brothers on Tuesday. Channel 13 “(His) return home is nothing short of miraculous,” it said. “However, we must remember: military operations alone cannot free the remaining 108 hostages, who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror.” Protests demanding the Israeli government do more to secure the release of the remaining hostages have been going on for months. Al-Qadi’s friend Abu Siam said he had taken part in some of those protests and that he asked Al-Qadi when he visited him in hospital whether he was aware of the demonstrations. “I asked him if he saw me on the roads and the streets calling to free him from the captivity and he told me his was disconnected from Israeli news,” Abu Siam told CNN’s Jim Sciutto. ﻿Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said a “daring and courageous” operation led to Al-Qadi’s rescue. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was “overjoyed” by the development. ‘Not a single drop of blood was shed’ The Bedouin community in Israel – a Muslim, semi-nomadic, and ethnically Arab group – is considered a subset of the country’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population. While some identify as Bedouin Israelis, others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. Unlike Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to volunteer, often serving in specialized units like the Gadsar 585 , known as the Bedouin battalion, which operates in the Negev desert, where most Bedouins originate. Al-Qadi’s brother Juma’a said the Bedouin community in Tarabin village was proud that “not a single drop of blood was shed” during Al-Qadi’s rescue. “Not a child, not a Palestinian, not a Jew or anyone shed blood for my brother,” he said. Before Israel’s founding in 1948, the Negev was home to 92,000 Bedouins, but only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war of that year, according to Minority Rights Group . Those who stayed “were treated harshly, uprooted time and again and forced to live in reservations,” the international human rights organization said. Today, Bedouin in the Negev still struggle to exercise basic human rights to water, shelter and education, according to Minority Rights Group, which blames Israeli authorities for withholding essential services from Bedouin villages it does not recognize. Tens of thousands of Bedouin live in such villages, where they face the threat of home demolition, eviction or forced displacement, the group estimates.

Al-Qadi’s rescue means 104 hostages are being held from the October 7 attack, according to figures from the Israeli prime minister’s office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Of those, 34 are presumed dead. Last week the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from Gaza during an overnight military operation in Khan Younis, Israeli authorities said. Hopes of a ceasefire-for-hostages deal, which would halt fighting in Gaza and see the return of people held by Hamas, have repeatedly been raised and dashed in recent months. Negotiators are continuing to work on a deal, and have met with increasing intensity in recent weeks. Talks made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the discussions in Cairo, Egypt, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday it killed Wissam Khazem, whom it described as the Hamas leader in the city of Jenin, in an exchange of gunfire after he was identified “in a vehicle in the area.” The military said it had found weapons and money in the vehicle. Two others were also killed as they tried to flee the vehicle, according to the Israeli military, naming them as Maysara Masharqa and Arafat Amer. The IDF said both men belonged to Hamas and “operated under the command of Khazem and took part in shooting attacks against Israeli communities.” In a statement, the Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, acknowledged the three men’s deaths and confirmed Khazem was one of its leaders in Jenin. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a network of Palestinian armed groups, said Masharqa was its “most prominent field commanders” in Jenin. As of Friday, 19 Palestinians have been killed during an expansive Israeli military operation in the West Bank that includes the cities of Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarem, according to the Palestinian ministry of health and Palestinian groups. A total of 11 Palestinian militants have been killed in the Israeli operation, according to a CNN count. Of those, five were killed Thursday during an exchange of fire “within and near a mosque” in Tulkarem. The IDF said it had killed Muhhamad Jabber, known as Abu Shujaa, the leader of the local branch of the militant group Islamic Jihad, which later confirmed Jabber’s death. Friday’s firefight came after Israel launched one of the largest assaults on the occupied territory in years. Stressing the need to root out what he called “Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” Foreign Minister Israel Katz called for a Gaza-style operation in the West Bank. Katz warned that Iran was working in the West Bank to establish an “eastern front” against Israel, working alongside its proxies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Israel’s renewed offensive in the West Bank has sparked criticism from senior United Nations and Western officials.

The firefight came after Israel on Wednesday launched one of the largest assaults on the occupied territory in years, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz calling for a Gaza-style operation in the West Bank to root out what he called “Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure.” After Israel mounted further raids early Thursday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said among the five killed in the mosque was Muhhamad Jabber, known as Abu Shujaa, the leader of the local branch of the militant group Islamic Jihad. Jabber had carried out numerous terror attacks, the IDF said, including a shooting attack in the West Bank city of Qalqilya in June, when an Israeli civilian was killed. Later Thursday, the Islamic Jihad announced the “martyrdom” of Jabber, whom they said was the commander of the Tulkarem Battallion of the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the militant group. The four others killed along with Jabber were related to his terror network and one more person has been apprehended, the IDF’s international spokesperson Lt. Col.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet have “defined the destruction of Hamas’ military and governing capabilities” as one of their key aims in Gaza, though the notion was rejected by Israeli Defense Forces Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in June, when he called promises to “make Hamas vanish” outlandish and tantamount to “throwing sand in the eyes of the public.” But that number falls to 49% when the more ambitious goal of dismantling Hamas, the terror group that carried out the October 7 attacks inside Israel, is described as the endgame. The results of the 2024 Chicago Council Survey , carried out in late June into July, and another poll from Council-IPSOS, conducted in mid-August, described the US as closely divided over the American government’s role in Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza, with a narrow majority, 53%, now saying the US should condition that military aid to Israel not be used toward military operations against Palestinians. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas last fall, the enclave’s health ministry announced on August 16. The death toll has risen since then, and, despite optimistic talk from US leaders about a potential ceasefire, Israel announced a new military operation in the occupied West Bank this week, a move that could further broaden the conflict. Overall, a plurality of Americans said the US is “striking the right balance” in its support of Israel (22%) or failing to do enough to support Israel (20%). Three in 10 respondents said the US is “supporting Israel too much.” An additional 27% said they were not sure. The findings were roughly the same when the question focused specifically on military aid. Similar shares of Democrats and Republicans say the US is delivering the right amount of military aid to Israel, at 28% and 29%, respectively. The parties differ over the level of aid the US is providing, with 42% of Democrats saying the US is offering “too much” support, while 34% of Republicans believe not enough is being done. Support across party lines for restricting military aid to Israel remains largely unchanged since a similar question was asked before the October 7 attack – the figure was 52% in September 2023 and 53% in June 2024. Democrats became six points more supportive of restrictions over that period, while Republican support dropped by seven. Republican leaders have on the whole been more aligned with Netanyahu’s government. Former President Donald Trump, who has run hot and cold with the prime minister, called for Israel to “finish the job” in Gaza during his lone debate with President Joe Biden. He has also criticized the Israeli military for “losing the PR war” over the conflict. The GOP rank-and-file are more likely to say US humanitarian aid to Gaza has been delivered at “the right amount” (31%) than Democrats, among whom 44% said “not enough” has been done. Some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have criticized Netanyahu’s conduct. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the new Democratic presidential nominee, have offered slightly different messages about the war. Both are now firmly pushing for a ceasefire, with Biden having declared it was “time for this war to end” in late May. Harris, shortly after Biden dropped out of the presidential race, endorsed Israel’s right to defend itself, but also warned that Americans “cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering,” Harris said, “and I will not be silent.” At the Democratic convention last week in Chicago, Harris once again pledged US backing for Israel, condemned the atrocities of October 7 and insisted that the administration was determined to secure a lasting peace in the region. “At the same time,” she continued, “what has happened in Gaza over the last 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” While about 60% of Americans view the US as playing a generally positive role in “resolving problems in the Middle East,” their views of Israel’s conduct is less generous.  Only 39% said Israel is a positive force. A closer look at American attitudes toward Israel also reveals a significant partisan divide. Nearly 60% of Republicans say Israel is “defending its interests” and that its military’s actions are justified, compared with only 15% of Democrats who said the same. On the flip side, 50% of Democrats told pollsters that Israel had gone too far and acted unjustifiably, while only 14% of Republicans agreed. When combined with independents, there was an even three-way split. Thirty-two percent of Americans said Israel was justified and defending its interests; 34% disagreed, holding that Israel had gone too far; and the final third said they were “not sure.” There is, again, a sharp split on the question of whether Israel’s military is “intentionally targeting all Palestinians, including civilians.” Overall, 46% of Americans believe they are – a number boosted by Democrats, of whom 63% said Israel was not restricting its military actions to members of Hamas. Only 28% of Republicans said the same. US support for an independent Palestinian state, uniting the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has remained steady over the past six years, according to the report, at 49%. But the underlying figures show an increasing partisan divide, with Democrats increasingly backing a state (67%) while Republicans (27%) are now even less likely to do the same. The June 21-July 1 Chicago Council survey was conducted by Ipsos and surveyed 2,106 US adults using a nationally representative online panel. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.3 percentage points."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had launched a large counter-terror operation overnight with the I﻿srael Security Agency (ISA) in the areas of Jenin and Tulkarem in the north of the West Bank. Early indications showed a significant, combined Israeli operation, involving drones and bulldozers, military and security forces, four battalions of the Israel Border Police, and an elite unit of undercover troops. Video obtained by CNN showed bulldozers tearing up a street in a built up area of Tulkarem, and also moving in convoy through Jenin. Additional footage released by Israel’s military showed what it said was a strike on a militant operations room in Nur Shams, a refugee camp near Tulkarem. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the operation had been staged to “thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” claiming that Iran was working to establish an “eastern front” against Israel. “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps are required,” he wrote on social media. “This is a war for all terms and purposes and we must win it.” The operation comes as Israel steps up its military operations in the West Bank, where clashes have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. The IDF’s international spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said in a briefing that Israel had identified “a systematic strategy in Iran” of smuggling weapons and explosives into the West Bank. “Specifically, about Jenin and Tulkarm, we’ve seen over 150 shooting and explosive attacks originated from these areas alone over the past year,” Shoshani said on Wednesday. The Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry condemned the “violation and crimes” by Israel, “especially the ongoing war of genocide in the Gaza Strip and the targeting of the northern West Bank.” Palestinian deaths were reported in the towns of Tubas and Jenin, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). Later, the Ministry of Health said a Palestinian had been killed by gunfire in the town of Kafr Dan in Jenin district. The death toll rose to at least 11, according the latest statement from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. At least two of those killed in Jenin were as a result of Israeli military fire and three others were killed in a drone strike on a vehicle on the outskirts of Jenin, according to the PRCS. It added that one person was critically injured in the strike. On Wednesday, the United Nations chief called on Israel to immediately cease its military operation in the West Bank. The Israeli action was “fueling an already explosive situation in the occupied West Bank and further undermining the Palestinian Authority,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, according to a statement by his spokesperson. “Only an end to the occupation and a return to a meaningful political process that will establish a two-state solution will bring a end to the violence,” Guterres posted on X. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on X that Israel’s operation “must not constitute the premises of a war extension from Gaza, including full-scale destruction.” The Israeli foreign minister’s comparison of the operation with Gaza, particularly regarding the evacuation of Palestinians, “threatens to fuel further instability,” he said.

Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images Medical facilities besieged The Palestinian Ministry of Health warned that the Israeli military’s operation has impacted hospitals with reports that Israeli forces have besieged several medical facilities in Jenin and obstructed the movement of ambulances. In a statement, the ministry said Israeli forces blocked roads to Ibn Sina hospital with mounds of dirt, surrounded the government hospital in Jenin, and besieged the Red Crescent Society and the Patient’s Friends Society. “Dozens of patients are currently being treated in government, private, and charitable hospitals in Jenin,” the ministry said, adding that the lives of patients and medical staff are under threat.

IDF spokesperson Shoshani said troops have “no plan to seize or capture” the hospital in Jenin, but have stationed troops to prevent “terrorists” from seeking shelter and operating from there. “We’re trying to prevent the hospitals from becoming a war zone,” he said. Director of Jenin Government Hospital, Wissam Bakr, told CNN earlier on Wednesday that “three Israeli military vehicles (were) at the entrance of the hospital” and that the Governor of Jenin had been informed of Israeli troops intention to “to storm the Jenin Government hospital.” ‘General mobilization’ The Islamic Jihad militant group condemned the Israeli military’s “comprehensive aggression” on areas of the occupied West Bank, referring to it as an “open and undeclared war.” In a separate statement, the group’s military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, said it targeted and shot down an Israeli drone near Jenin. The group said its fighters are targeting Israeli forces with “heavy volleys of direct bullets.” CNN has not been able to verify the claim by Al-Quds Brigade. CCTV footage obtained from social media show Israeli military vehicles traveling along a road in Jenin on Wednesday. Social Media/Reuters Meanwhile, Hamas called for a “general mobilization… against the occupation and its settlers everywhere on our occupied land.” The group said the Israeli operation was “extensive” and accused the Israeli military of “deliberate destruction of infrastructure using large military forces accompanied by aerial bombardment from drones and warplanes.” Israel has occupied the West Bank since seizing the territory from Jordan in 1967. In the decades since, it has expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank, considered illegal under international law, despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s. The Palestinian health ministry reported on Tuesday that 652 Palestinians, including 150 children, have been killed in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October 7, with over 5,400 others injured. Israel condemns ‘terror’ attack by settlers As well as raids by the Israeli military, armed Jewish settlers have also launched frequent attacks on Palestinian towns. On August 15, more than 70 armed settlers attacked the village of Jit , firing live bullets at residents and setting several homes, cars, and other property on fire, according to the head of the village council, Nasser Sedda. One resident told CNN he had seen some 30 settlers – armed and dressed in black – jumping over the fence to his house, breaking windows and throwing Molotov cocktails inside. Top Israeli officials, including from the IDF, have condemned the attack on Jit. One Palestinian was killed by gunfire and another injured in the attack, according to the IDF – which says it is investigating the death with the Israel Securities Authority. “This is a very serious terror incident in which Israelis set out to deliberately harm the residents of the town of Jit, and we failed by not succeeding to arrive earlier to protect them,” the IDF Central Command Commanding Officer MG Avi Blut said in a statement Wednesday. Three adults have been detained under an administrative order and additional arrests are planned, the statement added. Two rapid response team members have also been dismissed and their weapons have been confiscated because they were at the scene “without authorization, dressed in uniform, and acted contrary to the authority defined for the members of the rapid response team,” the statement said. The Israeli army said the investigation into the incident “is still ongoing, and it will not be closed until we bring the perpetrators to justice.” In a landmark advisory opinion in July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN’s top court, said the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and that it should end its “unlawful presence” there “as rapidly as possible.” This story has been updated with additional information.

The US alleges the group also guarded the outposts of Israeli individuals previously sanctioned by the US. The US also sanctioned an Israeli individual, Yitzhak Levi Filant, who allegedly “led a group of armed settlers to set up roadblocks and conduct patrols to pursue and attack Palestinians in their lands and forcefully expel them from their lands” in February. “The United States will continue to take action to promote accountability for those who commit and support extremist violence affecting the West Bank,” Miller said. In the announcement, Miller again called on Israel’s government to “hold accountable” those responsible for settler violence against civilians in the West Bank. These sanctions are the latest in a wave from the US targeting Israel settler violence against Palestinians that has increased in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack against Israel that triggered the outbreak of the war in Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry reported on Tuesday that 652 Palestinians, including 150 children, have been killed in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October 7, with over 5,400 others injured. Most recently, the Biden administration sanctioned an Israeli violent extremist organization, Lehava, three Israeli individuals and four “outposts” connected to violence against Palestinians in the West Bank in July. President Joe Biden issued an executive order in February targeting violent West Bank settlers accused of directly perpetrating violence or intimidation. The administration alleged the targeted individuals of initiating and leading a riot, setting buildings, fields and vehicles on fire and assaulting civilians and damaging property. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the time called the sanctions unnecessary. “Israel acts against all lawbreakers everywhere, so there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard,” the prime minister’s office said at the time, adding that “the absolute majority” of Israeli settlers in the West Bank “are law-abiding citizens.” Prior to the order, in December, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new policy restricting extremist Israeli settlers responsible for violence in the West Bank from obtaining visas to come to the US. “We will continue to seek accountability for all acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank, regardless of the perpetrator or the victim,” Blinken said at the time. The new round of sanctions comes as Israel has killed at least 10 Palestinians in what the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) called an expansive counterterrorism operation in the West Bank involving raids and airstrikes. The Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry condemned the “violation and crimes” by Israel, “especially the ongoing war of genocide in the Gaza Strip and the targeting of the northern West Bank.” Hamas has called for a return to suicide bombings against Israeli military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli settlements in the West Bank , which have expanded for decades, are considered illegal under international law."

The US assesses that Hezbollah, the most powerful, capable and independent of Iran’s proxies across the region, does not want a full-scale war with Israel now, according to current and former US officials, even as it has engaged in a long-running series of relatively contained fire across the border. Hezbollah felt it had to respond to the Israeli assassination of one of its most senior commanders, Fu’ad Shukr, last month. But analysts say the targets selected by Hezbollah were military targets, hinting at a clear effort by the group to signal that its response was proportionate and to contain the risk of escalation. That’s not to say tensions in the Middle East are not high. Officials believe that Iran may still respond to the Israeli killing of a top Hamas official in Tehran — and that there may be further attacks from other Iranian-backed groups. A Hezbollah UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is intercepted by Israeli air forces over northern Israel following what Israel called preemptive strikes against the militant group. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images ANALYSIS Israel and Hezbollah step back from the brink of wider war — for now And uncertainty still hangs over the region as the conflict in Gaza grinds on, with a mounting Palestinian death toll and the two men responsible for reaching a resolution — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — still very far apart. But by Tuesday, Hezbollah had announced that its retaliation was “over.” Talks over a possible ceasefire in Gaza are limping along, moving from Cairo to Doha, Qatar, and Hezbollah and Israel’s exchanges have returned to typical tit-for-tat strikes across the border. Concerns were high last week that a major flare-up could trigger a wider war. On Saturday night, Israel acted on intelligence to preemptively strike more than 40 Hezbollah launch sites that it said were poised to be used in a major attack. Hezbollah quickly responded, firing what it said were both attack drones and more than 300 rockets at Israel. US officials said the speed of the Hezbollah response showed that it was prepared to launch a large-scale attack, and CNN has previously reported the group had already selected targets. One US military official said the original scope of the attack was expected to be roughly equivalent to what Hezbollah ultimately fired — over 300 projectiles. The Israeli military said the attack did “very little damage.” But almost immediately, Hezbollah was using public language that appeared aimed at cooling tensions. Officials and analysts say Hezbollah is well aware that a full-scale war with Israel would be incredibly destructive and offer little opportunity for strategic victory. The last time the two sides went to war, in 2006, hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes, more than 1,000 Lebanese people were killed, and civilian infrastructure and the Lebanese economy were damaged — all without a clear “victory” or resolution. Now, analysts say, Hezbollah likely knows that it lacks the domestic political support it would need to engage in all-out war with Israel — at a time when Lebanon’s economy and political system are already in shambles. “There’s long memories of 2006 and how the population blamed Hezbollah and [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah personally for what came — and that was a time when the Lebanese economy and political system was functioning,” said Jonathan Panikoff, a former US senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. “I think eventually there will be a major war,” he added. “But I’m skeptical it’s going to happen [now], from an intention perspective.” Watching Iran closely Although Washington officials have speculated that Iran and Hezbollah could coordinate their responses to Israel for the assassination of the Hamas leader and the Hezbollah commander, some analysts say the dynamics are distinct. Hezbollah, officials said, has a far more direct stake in responding to Israel — and indeed, for weeks, officials have told CNN that they were more concerned about Hezbollah’s reaction than Iran’s. In April, Iran launched a massive salvo of missiles and drones at Israel in response to the Israeli killing of a senior Iranian commander in what Iran considered a diplomatic compound. But the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was different. The Iranian regime was “embarrassed,” said one source familiar with US intelligence, because the killing showed massive gaps in Iranian security — but ultimately, this person and others said, Haniyeh was not Iranian. Although Iran may be coming under pressure from some of its proxies to take a more aggressive stance against Israel, US officials believe that it is still deciding how and whether to respond — and that it is deeply reluctant to risk a possible regional war by engaging in direct conflict with Israel. “The issue is about embarrassment and restoring deterrence, but less about actual retribution,” Panikoff said. “There’s more variables that might restrain Iran because of who Israel actually killed.” Still, the US has not discounted the possibility that Iran may yet launch an attack on Israel. “We have to assume that Iran remains postured and prepared, should that be a decision that they make, which is why we continue to maintain a very robust force posture in the region,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday when asked whether there was an updated assessment on the likelihood that Tehran would strike Israel directly. Gaza ceasefire talks The worst may have been avoided for now, but US officials remain deeply concerned that the possibility of a broader regional war is only growing without a resolution to the conflict in Gaza. Officials have said publicly and privately that the strikes over the weekend had little impact on the ceasefire talks ongoing in Cairo.

Kirby noted that all sides, including Hamas, are represented in the talks and that the discussions have been able to move on with more specificity as they work to hammer out a deal. “I think it’s safe to say that the issues they’re going to be talking about are of a much more detailed, specific nature than we’ve typically been able to talk about,” he said. “For instance, one issue that will be for the working groups to flesh out is the exchange of hostages and prisoners that Israel’s holding.” Still, Israel has made it clear that following an initial six-week pause in the fighting, a break may be just that — a break — and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire."

Talks had made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the talks in Cairo, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement including the names of prisoners that would be exchanged as part of the pact. While such progress does not guarantee a final agreement anytime soon, negotiators in the Egyptian capital are now discussing the “nuts and bolts” of a deal, the official said. Kirby on Monday noted that all sides, including Hamas, are represented in the talks and that the discussions have been able to move on with more specificity as they work to hammer out a deal. Bassem Naim, a Hamas political bureau member, said Hamas was not participating in negotiations on Monday. Speaking to Al Arabi TV, he reiterated Hamas’s position that it is “ready to negotiate what was agreed upon” in a July 2 proposal but will “not accept the conditions that [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu added.” A Palestinian child in Gaza stands in the street with a water can and a toy horse, surrounded by rubble. Palm Media/MAP Related article Children are drinking from puddles and wading through sewage pools, as Israel pummels water systems in Gaza Negotiators have worked for months to bridge demands by Netanyahu and Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza. The remaining sticking points, while significant, are seen as potentially surmountable, the official said. One issue is the Israeli military’s presence on Gaza’s side of the border with Egypt, an area known as the Philadelphi corridor. Hamas opposes Israel’s desire to continue to station troops there in the early phase of a ceasefire deal. The US official said the current proposal calls for an Israeli military withdrawal from “densely populated areas” in Gaza, and that the current debate is focused on what parts of the Philadelphi corridor qualify as densely-populated versus unpopulated, where the IDF will maintain a presence in the first phase of an agreement. However, the Hamas negotiating delegation left Cairo on Sunday publicly reiterating the group’s demand that any agreement must include “a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the freedom of return of residents to their areas, relief and reconstruction, and a serious exchange deal.” The US official said despite public comments by Hamas, “negotiators believe Hamas may be more flexible on an Israeli presence during the first phase of an agreement.” Displaced Palestinians walk on a street covered with stagnant wastewater in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, on July 19. A ceasefire would allow a moment of relief for Gazans, after nearly a year of Israeli attacks. Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images The proposed agreement involves a “huge surge of humanitarian aid”, as well as a commitment to remove rubble and begin reconstruction, which are intended to bring “massive relief for Gazans,” said the US official. US negotiators expect Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to receive a copy of the latest proposal as soon as the coming days, though the timing is not clear given the difficulty of communications with him. A second US official said talks in Cairo were “constructive and were conducted in a spirit on all sides to reach a final and implementable agreement,” and that lower-level working group talks would continue in the coming days to “further address remaining issues and details.” On Thursday, the US and Egypt met with Israel to try to narrow remaining gaps and clarify issues in the text of bridging proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. The US and Egypt met bilaterally on Friday to discuss and prepare for the high-level talks this past weekend. On Saturday, Qatar and Egypt met with senior representatives of Hamas and went through each paragraph of the proposal in detail to identify any remaining issues or questions to clarify, the source said. Backdrop of regional unease The fact that the talks in Cairo went ahead Sunday despite the massive exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the weekend provided some sense of relief. Some US and Israeli officials believe that Hezbollah’s strike, which was largely neutralized by Israeli forces, removes leverage which Hamas had hoped would apply pressure on Israel for further concessions. Pressure is mounting to seal a deal against the backdrop of severe starvation , dire water shortages , mass displacement and disease in Gaza, caused by Israel’s war on Hamas in the strip. Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed at least 40,435 Palestinians and injured another 93,534 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. Israel’s military on Sunday ordered more evacuations in an area in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza where thousands of Gazans are currently sheltering. A senior UN official says no aid deliveries are happening in Gaza on Monday due to security risks after Israel ordered new evacuations for Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. But the official says the UN is not leaving Gaza “because the people need us there,” and that it wants to find a new location to operate in. Amid renewed Israeli evacuation orders, the IDF-designated “humanitarian zone” in the Strip has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities. There are 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli government’s press office.

A deadly rocket strike from Lebanon last month on the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights was followed by an Israeli retaliatory strike that killed Hezbollah’s top commander, Fu’ad Shukr, in southern Beirut. The powerful Iran-backed group vowed to respond. The threat triggered a slew of flight cancelations on both sides of the border, a chorus of governments imploring their citizens to leave Lebanon and Israel, and a breathless diplomatic effort to avert an escalation that Western governments feared would spark a regional conflict. On Sunday morning, Hezbollah said it had delivered its anticipated response by launching hundreds of drones and Katyusha rockets, Soviet-era short-range projectiles.

Hezbollah dismissed this. “What happened was aggression, not preemptive action,” Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech on Sunday night, referring to the Israeli strikes that began around half an hour before Hezbollah’s attack. Three Lebanese fighters were killed in those Israeli attacks, Hezbollah said. The cross-border fire on Sunday morning marked a significant escalation after nearly 11 months of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. But it appears to have dampened fears of a wider war, for now. In Israel, authorities soon lifted security restrictions in the country’s northern-most territory, known as the upper Galilee. In Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had concluded attacks on Israel for the day. Nasrallah declared the group’s retaliation for Shukr’s killing “meticulously” completed. With both sides declaring victory, the region appears to once again have walked back from the brink of all-out war. But while Hezbollah’s promised response appears to be largely out of the way, Israel must continue to wait for another threat to transpire: Iran’s vowed “revenge” for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which it blamed on Israel. The low-intensity conflict at the Lebanon-Israel border is set to resume. Netanyahu said on Sunday that “what happened today is not the end.” Nasrallah meanwhile struck a similar tone, reinforcing a widely held view that the fighting on the border is a war of attrition, where each side aims to wear down the other. A region on a knife’s edge After the attacks in Beirut and Tehran at the end of last month, Western and Israeli intelligence officials, diplomats and analysts scrambled to figure out what the retaliations promised by Iran and its most powerful non-state partner might look like. It sparked shuttle diplomacy with the United States, the United Kingdom and France urging Hezbollah and Iran to exercise restraint. This appeared to expedite another round of talks over a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, in a bid to ward off another escalation by the Iran-led axis, which has repeatedly conditioned stopping its attacks on Israel and its allies on an end to the Israeli offensive in Gaza. The talks to end the war continue to move at a glacial pace, despite intense diplomatic efforts by mediators including the US, Egypt and Qatar. High-level talks in Cairo ended on Sunday, giving way to the resumption of lower-level technical negotiations. But even as the US expresses optimism, with one official describing the weekend’s talks as “constructive,” there are no signs of progress on the major sticking points. Video Ad Feedback Hezbollah leader: We will ‘wait and see’ if there will be more strikes 02:26 - Source: CNN This raises the stakes for a potential showdown between Iran and Israel. But Tehran may be inclined to pay lip service to the talks. While it has vowed to respond to Israel, the Islamic Republic has repeatedly said that it wants to avoid action that could adversely impact the negotiations. And the latest escalation has shown that neither Iran nor its allied non-state fighting groups in the region can stomach the prospect of a wider war. Hezbollah had repeatedly vowed to retaliate to any Israeli strike in Beirut with an attack on major urban centers in Israel. Yet, whether by design or due to Israel’s claimed pre-emptive strikes, it fell short of that threat. Most of the areas it targeted on Sunday were within the border area that has been the site of the hostilities since October and the short-range Soviet-era rockets it used have been a mainstay of Hezbollah’s attacks on Israeli forces for decades. The risk of an all-out conflict appears to be significantly lower in the aftermath of Sunday’s crossfire. Yet Iran’s open-ended threat will continue to contribute to the war of nerves that has defined much of the low-grade conflict between the Tehran-led axis and Israel. The region will remain on a knife’s edge for as long as the war in Gaza goes on, at the mercy of the next miscalculation, no matter how low the warring parties’ appetite for conflict might be.

The overnight strikes are some of the most serious yet between Israel and Hezbollah, who have been exchanging fire for months. The hostilities have raised the specter of a regional conflagration, prompting intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 100 of its fighter jets “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels” across dozens of launch sites from Lebanon on Sunday. It followed these up with further attacks later in the day. Israel said it carried out the strikes in self-defense after identifying that Hezbollah was “preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.” Hezbollah called Israel’s description of its strike as preemptive “baseless.” “We removed a wider threat, probably also a future threat in some areas,” IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Sunday.

Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Related article The Middle East may have backed off from the brink of a regional war – for now Soon after the Israeli raids, the IDF said approximately 200 rockets had been launched from Lebanon towards Israel early Sunday, with no reports of injuries so far. Hezbollah said the “first phase” of its strikes against Israel “ended with complete success,” claiming that it launched 320 rockets and a barrage of drones toward Israel. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech later on Sunday that the group’s attack on Israel was “meticulously” completed but further strikes could be carried out. Hezbollah said it carried out strikes towards Israel in response to the killing of top military commander Fu’ad Shukr last month in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military intercepted “all of the drones that Hezbollah launched to a strategic target in the center of the country,” without clarifying what the target was. Netanyahu added that “what happened today is not the end,” and that Nasrallah in Beirut and Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in Tehran “should know that this was another step on our way to change the situation in the north and safely return our residents to their homes.” One Israeli soldier, 21-year-old David Moshe Ben Shitrit of the Israeli Navy, was killed in the fighting. He and two others were injured “either directly from an Iron Dome interceptor or from falling shrapnel from the interceptor that accidentally hit a Dvora-class fast patrol boat after intercepting a UAV,” an army official told CNN. Two people were killed in Israeli strikes on the village of At Tiri in Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon, Lebanese health officals said, and a third was killed when a car was hit in the town of Khiyam. The Hezbollah-allied Shia group Amal movement also said one of its fighters, was killed in Khiyam, but it is unclear if they are the same person.

Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images For the Lebanese group, Shukr’s assassination was a change in the rules of engagement, Danny Citrinowicz, research fellow in the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said. “They had to retaliate,” Citrinowicz told CNN, adding that the group may have been trying to “draw a line in the sand” to avoid further attacks. “The question was not if but when,” he said, adding that it is yet to be seen whether the group will be content with its attack or whether more projectiles will follow in the coming days. Ceasefire talks resume despite strikes The attacks took place just hours before mediation talks resumed in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which aim to strike a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli official told CNN on Sunday afternoon that Israeli negotiators arrived in Cairo for ceasefire and hostage release negotiations. CNN Related card Hezbollah: What weapons does it have?

The Iranian government is yet to react to the cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah, something Citrinowicz said suggested Iran was willing to distance itself from Hezbollah’s attack amid the negotiations in Cairo. Following the strikes, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant declared a “‘special situation on the home front’ across the country,” which enables the Israeli military to issue instructions to citizens, “including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant.” ﻿ US President Joe Biden is closely monitoring events in Israel and Lebanon, the White House said Saturday night.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/middleeast/israel-ready-iran-hezbollah-attack-intl-latam/index.html,Israel says it is prepared for any retaliatory attack from Iran or Hezbollah,The news comes amid claims in the Israeli media that there are situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon.,"Aug 25, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Dana Karni,Middle East,"CNN — Israel said Saturday its military was prepared for any possible retaliatory attacks by Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah or Iran for the killings of their senior leaders. The news comes amid claims in the Israeli media that there are situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon. Both Hezbollah and Iran have been threatening to retaliate against Israel since a string of figures in Iran-backed militant groups were killed over a span of weeks. Those killings included the death of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander Fu’ad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut at the end of July and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Asked about the threats of retaliation, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters Saturday that the military was prepared for any possible attack by either Hezbollah or Iran. “We take our enemies’ threats seriously and we’ve been ready for a long period. We’re highly prepared both in the offense and defense, but above all, any threat toward the citizens of Israel we identify, we eliminate, and that’s how we’ll continue. Any development that will be, we’ll update the public immediately,” Hagari said. Hagari was then pressed by a reporter from Israel’s state-run Kan 11 television channel, who said there were situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon. The IDF spokesperson did not say whether he was familiar with those assessments, nor did he give any indication of when an attack might be expected. CNN Related card Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide “We’ve been, like I said, we’ve been ready, first of all, both in offense and defense, for a long time. We operate to eliminate threats and will continue to do so. With any change or development, we will immediately update the public. Our mission is to defend the citizens of Israel,” Hagari said. A major attack against Israel could risk disrupting the ceasefire talks that US officials have said were at an advanced stage prior to the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, which Iran has blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli government press office. This week, the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from tunnels in Gaza in an Israeli military operation in the city of Khan Younis. Israel’s war in Gaza was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,200 people have died in Gaza during the war, according to Palestinian authorities."

As senior negotiators prepare to meet this weekend in Cairo, there are still several sticking points in the talks over the potential three-phase agreement. But Israel has made it clear that following the initial six-week phase, a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire. “I am ready to do a partial deal, it is no secret, that will bring back some of the people,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel’s Channel 14 in late June. “But we are committed to continue the war after the pause in order to achieve the goal of destroying Hamas. I will not give up on this.” There’s no indication that Israel’s position has changed and the fact this stance doesn’t violate the agreement being discussed represents a breakthrough for Israel in the negotiations. It essentially allows Israel – and Hamas – to abandon discussions after the six-week first phase and resume the war. That breakthrough was a concession by the Palestinian militant group, which has been pushing for the temporary pause to seamlessly transition to a permanent ceasefire and the war to end. The sister-in-law of a deceased Israeli hostage who met with Netanyahu this week, Riki Baruch, told CNN her takeaway from the meeting was “the prime minister’s promise to defeat Hamas, and to continue fighting until the last of the hostages returns.” The sister-in-law of a deceased Israeli hostage who met with Netanyahu this week, Riki Baruch, told CNN her takeaway from the meeting was “the Prime Minister’s promise to defeat Hamas, and to continue fighting until the last of the hostages returns.” Knowing that the long-sought-after agreement wouldn’t guarantee an end to the war, US officials have lowered their expectations and focused on getting first to a period of calm, even if it’s technically just temporary, hoping that enough pressure would build on multiple fronts during the pause to prevent the reignition of violence. “What we’re focused on right now is getting a ceasefire deal in place, getting those hostages home, getting six weeks of calm,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last week. “That’s really what our goal is right now.” A ceasefire deal that leads to a pause in fighting would be welcomed by countless people on both sides. Palestinians in Gaza, almost all of whom have been displaced, would get a respite after almost a year of continuous Israeli bombing, along with desperately needed aid. Israeli families would get hostages or their remains home after 10 painful months of waiting. Huge challenges remain if initial deal is reached But as complicated as the hurdles are to reaching this first stage of an agreement, even tougher challenges loom before Israel will agree to end the war. The way the agreement is laid out, that permanent end to the fighting is set to begin in the second phase, at which point Hamas would release all remaining hostages and all Israeli troops would withdraw from Gaza. In the third phase, reconstruction in the enclave would begin and the final remains of hostages would be returned. In announcing the framework on May 31 – which both Hamas and Israel agreed to — President Joe Biden admitted there would be considerable issues left to negotiate after the temporary pause started. Hamas had hoped the only remaining discussion would be about how many Palestinian prisoners would be released for the Israeli hostages, but Israel pushed for that topic – known as the “keys” — to just be one of the topics the sides could discuss during the transition from the first phase to secure the second. As long as those discussions continue, Biden had said, the ceasefire from the first phase would also continue, past the six-week mark. As hard as the mediators – the US, Egypt and Qatar – could try to keep those conversations on track to prevent a return to fighting, they could simply fall apart and both sides could once again take up arms. Hours after Biden laid out the May 31 framework, Netanyahu’s office posted on X that “Israel’s conditions for ending the war have not changed.” “The destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel,” he said. Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is believed to still be alive despite fierce Israeli efforts to hunt him down. Thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters also remain on the battlefield. Only around 30 of the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages would be expected to be released by Hamas in the first part of a truce and it’s still unclear how many of those would be alive, sources familiar the talks say. Negotiators are still discussing how many and which Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange, how many vetoes Israel would have over the names Hamas would put forward of those serving longer sentences for more violent crimes, and where they would be released to. New Philadelphi Corridor proposal Much attention recently has been focused on the question of Israeli troop presence along the Egypt-Gaza border, known as the Philadelphi corridor. In the agreement being discussed, IDF forces are supposed to withdraw from densely populated areas, but Israel has argued that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza. On Wednesday Netanyahu’s office denied an Israeli report that he had agreed to withdraw from the corridor. “Achievement of all of [Israel’s] objectives for the war,” a statement said, “requires securing the southern border.” Holding onto Philadelphi during the six-week first phase, even if were in a more limited way with fewer forces, would give Israel flexibility and more options militarily for later scenarios. CNN reported on Friday that Israel has come up with a new proposal on the corridor, which Egypt is set to deliver to Hamas. Israel submitted the revised plan on Thursday diplomat and an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. The new Israeli proposal, which includes a map of where Israeli troops would be deployed, reduces the number of troops and military posts along the strategic corridor bordering Egypt from Israel’s previous position, the Israeli source said. Egyptian negotiators had rejected the previous Israeli map days earlier and declined to transfer it to Hamas, calling it a non-starter.

Egyptian negotiators had rejected the previous Israeli map days earlier and declined to transfer it to Hamas, calling it a non-starter. Hamas’ response to the new proposal will be critical to determining whether it sends negotiators to an expected negotiating summit in Cairo on Sunday. If they attend, the two sides could hold true negotiations – with each side’s delegation occupying a room, and Egyptian and Qatari mediators going back-and-forth between the two. The new proposal was the product of an hours-long meeting between Netanyahu and his negotiating team on Thursday at which Netanyahu agreed to reduce troop levels. That meeting came a day after Netanyahu spoke with President Joe Biden, who pushed Netanyahu to show more flexibility on the Philadelphi corridor. Deep divisions among Israeli leadership There are deep divisions and differences of opinion among the Israeli security officials and the Netanyahu government. Far-right members of his cabinet have blasted any ceasefire agreement while Israeli reports cite security officials who accuse Netanyahu of sabotaging the negotiations. “The (Israeli) military would like a ceasefire now, a ceasefire that achieves objectives of getting hostages out,” a senior American official said. “All issues outstanding are manageable. Not perfect but manageable.” The lead negotiator for the Biden administration, CIA Director Bill Burns, has landed in Cairo for the latest round of talks on Friday. To try to finalize an agreement, the US, along with co-mediators Qatar and Egypt, put forward a proposal to bridge the final disagreements. Earlier this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was visiting Israel, said Netanyahu had agreed to the proposal while Hamas had not yet. Hamas has accused Israel in recent days of changing the terms, while reports have said that Netanyahu has changed and reneged on a number of positions. A senior Biden administration official recently called Israel’s changes “ clarifications,” while US officials have publicly and persistently maintained that a deal is close and that mere “implementation” issues remain to be discussed. But many involved are not as optimistic. One source familiar with all the discussions since the last temporary truce fell apart almost nine months ago called the situation “near hopeless,” adding that that this week’s negotiations following last week’s round in Doha have failed to produce positive developments. One major unknown is what Hamas leader Sinwar wants: a break for his fighters and the Palestinians suffering immensely or a larger regional conflict driven by Iran and Hezbollah that would further engulf Israel. Some observers believe Sinwar is waiting to see how Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran retaliate against Israel for recent assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut and Hamas’ political leader in Tehran. Whatever the outcome of the weekend’s talks, all signs suggest that the most Israel is willing to consider right now is 42 days of quiet. After that, all bets are off. “It’s easy to be pessimistic because it’s gone on a long time,” the senior American official conceded. “They could have closed this many times but didn’t.” CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

Egyptian negotiators had rejected the previous Israeli map days earlier and declined to transfer it to Hamas, calling it a non-starter. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt- that the IDF currently controls. The deployment of Israeli troops along the Philadelphi corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas. Israel has demanded maintaining control of the border zone, whereas Hamas has said Israeli troops must withdraw from the area. Hamas’ response to the new proposal will be critical to determining whether it sends negotiators to an expected negotiating summit in Cairo on Sunday.

Moments later, an orange blaze tears through the critical facility in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, as ribbons of grey smoke erupt into the sky. The blast was captured in a now deleted video , which was reportedly shared by an Israeli soldier on Instagram and geolocated by CNN. Satellite imagery shows that the reservoir was damaged between July 26 and July 27. Destroyed buildings are visible in the surrounding area. The reservoir could hold 3 million liters of water and was central to the treatment and distribution of water in the Rafah Governate, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), providing water for 150,000 people prior to October 7, when the war began. When asked about the incident captured on camera, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that its troops had been operating in the Tal al-Sultan area for several weeks to “dismantle terrorist infrastructures and eliminate terrorists, whilst taking feasible measures in order to mitigate damage to civilian structures.” It added that it examines reports of videos posted to social media and handles them with disciplinary measures. The IDF said the incident was under review by the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, “an independent investigative mechanism outside the chain of command entrusted with investigating exceptional events in warfare.” Maxar Technologies Maxar Technologies Satellite images show Canada Water reservoir in Rafah, southern Gaza, on July 18 (left) and July 30 (right). ©2024 Maxar Technologies There have been many water facilities damaged or destroyed by Israel’s 10-month-long assault in Gaza, according to the UN and various other international bodies, compounding the civilian population’s suffering, risking the spread of disease and leading human rights experts to accuse Israel of using water supply as a weapon . The destruction of the Canada Water reservoir “is certainly a breach of international humanitarian law (IHL),” Mark Zeitoun, director general of the Geneva Water Hub, a Swiss institute specializing in hydro-diplomacy, told CNN. “IHL is meant to protect against indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population or the objects they depend upon (for) survival,” he said. Even before the controlled explosion in late July, the Israeli siege drained fuel and electricity supplies needed to power the Canada Water reservoir and other water systems in the city, according to Rafah’s mayor, Ahmed Al-Sofi, causing severe shortages. “Rafah was already suffering from water shortages,” Al-Sofi told CNN in July. “The city of Rafah is a city struck by destruction, hunger and thirst.” The amount of water available in Gaza works out at 4.74 liters of water (1 gallon) per person per day, Oxfam reported in July, adding that this is “just under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies and less than a single toilet flush.” The international nonprofit has accused Israel of using water as a “weapon of war,” saying Palestinians in Gaza have “almost no water to drink, let alone to bathe, cook, or clean.” Extreme summer heat in Gaza is making a desperate shortage of water even worse for Palestinians already stalked by famine and struggling with repeated displacement. This June was the hottest on record in Israel, according to the Israel Meteorological Service. Temperatures in Negba, a few miles north of Gaza, reached 39.4 C (103F) in the middle of the month, according to CNN meteorologists. Israel’s war in Gaza has reduced supplies of fuel, chlorine and spare parts, stifling water production, purification and sewage pumping, according to the UN. Around 70% of all water and sanitation facilities in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, the WASH Cluster, a United Nations-led group that coordinates humanitarian efforts for water, sanitation and hygiene, said on July 24, citing satellite analysis from the UN Satellite Centre. Palestinian children cool off and fill up water jugs in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, amid a heatwave on June 9, a day after a deadly operation by Israeli forces to rescue hostages. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, told CNN in a statement that Israel allows and facilitates the “unlimited entry” of water tanks and fuel supplies into Gaza. It added that there has been a “continual effort” since the start of the war to facilitate the repair and extension of water wells, desalination facilities and water mains. But several Palestinians told CNN they are forced to make hazardous journeys in search of water, risking exposure to Israeli attacks. Two people told CNN they had witnessed physical violence and even killing at public distribution points as people fight for scant resources. Those displaced to makeshift camps described scenes of sewage spilling into the streets and children drinking from puddles. More than 1.7 million cases of infectious diseases have been recorded in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there. Traces of the highly infectious polio virus – transmitted through faeces, and contaminated water or food – were found in a 10-month-old child in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah earlier this month. The child was later paralyzed due to the disease, the UN said on August 23. World Health Organization (WHO) testing discovered the virus in sewage samples in Gaza in July, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis. After the Gaza Ministry of Health declared a polio epidemic last month, the WHO warned that ongoing Israeli bombardment had stifled vaccination efforts in Gaza . They are now calling for a halt to the fighting to allow for an effective vaccination drive. Widower Alaa Riyad says he treks many miles every day under the glare of the sun to collect water for his family, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza. The 42-year-old told CNN that he became “father and mother” to his children after his wife and 18 other relatives were killed by Israeli bombardment several months ago. “We have found worms in the water more than once,” he told CNN. “What can we do?… There is no life for us.” Israeli attacks in the strip have killed more than 40,200 Palestinians and injured about 93,000 since the war started, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after the militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities. ‘Near complete destruction of all water infrastructure’ Gaza’s water crisis has been building for decades. In 2017, the UN’s children’s agency, UNICEF, said that 95% of water from Gaza’s sole aquifer was “unfit for human consumption,” due to over-extraction, seawater infiltration and sewage contamination. In 2021, about 90% of Gaza’s water came from groundwater wells drawing water from that aquifer, according to the Palestinian Water Authority. The remaining 10% came mostly from desalination plants and Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, via three pipelines. But since early summer, Gaza’s municipal wells and desalination plants (two out of three of which are functioning) have operated at an average of around 15% and 22% capacity, respectively, according to CNN analysis of WASH Cluster data. Wim Zwijnenburg, who investigates the environmental impact of conflicts for the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN the level of damage done to Gaza’s water systems is “the most severe we’ve seen so far in any conflict in the last 10 years, probably even longer.” “What we’re seeing so far… is the near-complete destruction of all water infrastructure, which includes water pumping stations, water wells, the whole piping system in Gaza,” Zwijnenburg said. “The few functioning pumps that are still operating, the quality of the water is so bad… (But) people have no choice but to drink it.” Within the first week of the war, Saaed Al-Madhoun, an emergency response manager for the humanitarian agency CARE International, was forced to flee an Israeli incursion with his family near their home in Gaza City, which was later flattened by bombardment. The aid worker is haunted by “constant fear and uncertainty,” as the threat of Israeli attacks loom over his wife and five children, aged between 1 and 13 years old. They are displaced in miserable conditions in Deir al-Balah, where the entire family survives on just 20 liters of water per day – less than the minimum of 3 liters per person needed for survival, according to UNICEF . “Most of the water we access is not potable… it often has a salty or metallic taste,” he said in testimony relayed to CNN by CARE International. “I have seen children drinking from puddles.” ‘Completely miserable’ conditions in tent camps Barbed wire and concrete slabs sink into huge pools of green, sewage-contaminated water in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Footage filmed by a journalist working for CNN shows residents tiptoeing through streams of muddy water pouring through the once-vibrant neighborhood. The Israeli offensive has displaced up to 1.9 million people – nearly the entire population – in Gaza, according to the UN . People in sprawling tent camps say they can barely access potable water or sanitation facilities in areas polluted by raw sewage and teeming with bugs . Women endure several menstrual cycles without washing, according to the UN . Others queue in the heat to use toilets at overwhelmed hospitals – or risk being chased by dogs to use washrooms in the middle of the night. The UN previously recorded one improvised shelter with only 25 toilets for 14,000 people inside and 59,000 outside. Palestinians told CNN they must prioritize scarce water supplies for consumption instead of bathing, washing clothes or cleaning dishes. Parents told CNN they struggle to find enough gas or fuel to boil and sterilize water, increasing the risk of illness. Some give their children food that requires minimal water for preparation – but offers poor nutritional value. Others describe water contaminated during transportation in unclean tanks. Children walk through pools of green, sewage-contaminated water in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. CNN Mohammed Hamouda, a health worker displaced in Deir al-Balah, told CNN he and his family, including his three young children, have suffered from diarrhea and abdominal cramps due to consumption of dirty water. “We get the water supposedly clean and drinkable,” he said. “But gastrointestinal diseases and intestinal diseases occur… We do not know that it is unclean until after we use it,” he said. “Obtaining clean water is difficult. Getting water for bathing is more difficult. Finding a toilet to relieve oneself is also very difficult.” Muslims cannot find enough water to make ablution before prayer, a necessity for those seeking moments of relief through faith . Children suffer from skin rashes, expectant mothers face stillbirth risk Asma struggles to distract her children from the stinging pain of blisters and itchiness of head lice. The Palestinian mother is staying with seven relatives in Deir al-Balah, where insects crawl between the folds of their tent. “In the tents we have… an unimaginable quantity of insects, pincher bugs and cockroaches,” she said, in an account relayed to CNN by CARE International. “We get tired trying to cool and fan ourselves.” Asma’s last name has been withheld by CARE International to protect her identity. “My children are sick, and we can’t even find medical treatment,” she added. “We have no shampoo, or detergent to wash our clothes… What are we supposed to do?” A Palestinian girl is diagnosed with a skin infection in Gaza, on July 26. Health workers say children are catching skin infections due to contaminated water and a lack of access to sanitation facilities. Dawoud Abo Alkas/Anadolu/Getty Images Chronic water shortages will compound “all the existing fragility” among the population, according to Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care doctor working with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, especially for the most vulnerable. The stress of war paired with water shortages increases the risk of stillbirth , pre-term delivery and blood clots for pregnant women in Gaza , Haj-Hassan said. Breastfeeding women are less likely to produce enough milk for newborns, potentially causing malnourishment. Those who can access sparse supplies of powdered infant formula may not find clean water to make up bottles, compounding the risk of illness, Haj-Hassan added. Sustained restrictions on aid Israel’s COGAT told CNN they have facilitated the entry of 48,670 tons of water aid into Gaza since the war began, adding that they have provided 14 forklift trucks to assist with aid collection at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Gaza and Israel, as well as broadening supply routes and increasing operating hours for aid collection. But relief workers say what’s coming in is not nearly enough to respond to soaring needs, blaming Israel for sustained aid restrictions, blocked access to parts of the north , destruction of roads and attacks on relief convoys . Humanitarian workers and government officials told CNN in March that Israeli officials were repeatedly rejecting much needed aid, including water purification tablets and filtration systems, at entry points to Gaza. COGAT described the testimony given to CNN at the time as “false accusations.” Sham Abu Tabaq, age five, saw her father and sister shot dead in front of her. CNN Related article She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter. Then soldiers brought her to an Israeli hospital Liz Allcock, head of protection at the UK-based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians, told CNN she saw “thousands and thousands” of bottles of water sitting at the Kerem Shalom border crossing on July 3. Several Palestinians told CNN that scarcity, the risks involved in transporting water, and fuel shortages had driven up the cost of water to unaffordable levels. Some say the absence of regulation means water supplied by aid agencies is sold on the black market for an inflated cost. In some areas, water has risen from $7 for 1,000 liters (about 264 gallons) to $45 to $50, Haj-Hassan said. Hamouda, the father-of-three displaced in Deir al-Balah, said the daily cost of water for him and his family has risen from one-third of a dollar in October to $2. Raed Radwan, a father displaced to a tent in Deir al-Balah told CNN that he was constantly worried about keeping his family cool and hydrated. His five-month-old daughter recently suffered heatstroke, and he had no cold water to give her. “For nine months, we have been enduring the ongoing water crisis… I hope there will be a solution to the water problem because I can no longer handle it. I am mentally and physically exhausted,” he said in July. CNN’s Gianluca Mezzofiore, Abeer Salman, Tareq El Helou, Ibrahim Dahman and Lauren Izso contributed reporting."

People were seen in video walking or on donkey carts as they left areas near the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah. Some were in private cars, loaded with their belongings, including mattresses and blankets, water and gas bottles. The streets appear littered with leaflets dropped by the IDF reiterating the order to evacuate. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have also ordered evacuations for parts of the southern city of Khan Younis, as well as the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. Planet Labs, PBC Planet Labs, PBC Satellite images obtained by CNN from Planet Labs show just how many Gazans fled the areas that are no longer marked as being in the humanitarian zone. Above, the humanitarian zone near Qizan an Najjar before and after August 16. Many residents now on the move have had to evacuate time and time again – leaving them in a constant state of displacement, uncertainty and fear that there is nowhere left to flee. Evacuees leaving Deir al-Balah on Wednesday described the overwhelming sense of fear, sorrow and uncertainty. “There is bombardment, shooting, and quadcopters since this morning in the east of Deir al-Balah, so we are forced to flee. People go to the unknown. They have no idea,” said one evacuee, Muhammad Awad. “There are no longer places to go. There was only Deir al-Balah, and now they are asking us to evacuate Deir al-Balah,” one elderly man told CNN. “I am afraid that tomorrow they will confine all of us on the seashore of Deir al-Balah, then exterminate all of us.” “After so many displacements, we no longer have the strength to evacuate yet another time,” he added.

One woman on a cart, Um Alaa, said it was the fourth time she has had to evacuate since October last year. “We don’t know where to go. We are going to look for a spot away from this dangerous place,” she said. “The whole of Gaza has become dangerous.” Um Ismail, a woman with small children, said people were defenseless. “Why are they fighting us?” she said. “We are not Hamas, we are simply people staying put in our homes. They displaced us not once, but 10 times. Why? What have we done?” Abu Muhammad Hajjaj, a resident of Gaza City who had previously been displaced, lamented the lack of resources. Without money for a car, or even a tent to live in, “we don’t know where to go,” he told CNN. “People are crying and complaining of everything: disease, hunger, poverty, lack of hygiene, lack of medicine. You search in all of Gaza for paracetamol for a headache and you can’t find it,” he said. Palestinians flee with their belongings in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, on August 21, 2024. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/AP Steadily shrinking Nearly 84% of the enclave has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war, according to the United Nations’ main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, UNWRA. All the while, the Israel-designated “humanitarian zone” has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis. “Areas that were (in) the humanitarian zone are now the frontline,” said Louise Wateridge, spokesperson for UNWRA. Gazans “are never more than a few blocks away from the frontline now,” she told the UN’s news service. The evacuation orders have complicated aid efforts, too. The UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA reported that parts of a major road, crucial for humanitarian missions going from south to north, were caught up in the evacuations for Deir al-Balah. It is now “nearly impossible” for aid workers to travel along the route, preventing the delivery of critically needed supplies, the UN reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden. Getty Images Related article Biden spoke with Netanyahu Wednesday at a critical moment in Gaza talks Among those fleeing are staff from the international non-profit Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders. “The continuous forced displacement of people is inhumane,” MSF project coordinator Jacob Granger said in a statement on Wednesday. “People have no belongings left, nowhere left to go. There is no room to put tents up. The overcrowding, severe lack of water, and minimal sanitation services are fueling the spread of diseases.” The UN estimated in July that up to 1.9 million people in the strip have been displaced, almost the entire population of 2.1 million Gazans. Last week, the enclave’s Health Ministry estimated that more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas. That figure does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but the ministry said most of the dead are women and children. Israel said last month that it had killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers. Ceasefire talks Throughout the evacuations, US and Israeli leaders have continued discussing a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal – with President Joe Biden speaking with his Israeli counterpart Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, the White House said. It comes at a critical moment after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this week that it may be the last opportunity for a deal. CIA Director Bill Burns and other senior negotiators are expected to return to Cairo for further high-level talks this weekend. A major sticking point is the future of the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border, which the IDF currently controls. On Tuesday, Blinken said Israel had agreed to military withdrawals from Gaza that are laid out in the recent proposal, despite reported comments from Netanyahu. Blinken was responding to Israeli media reports that Netanyahu conveyed to America’s top diplomat that Israel would not leave the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim corridor, which bisects Gaza, “regardless of the pressure to do so.” This story has been updated with additional information.

Transport Minister Miri Regev, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, has been appointed by the government to organize the memorial. CNN video Related video Hear from woman who’s husband is still held by Hamas “A year has passed since citizens were abandoned in the greatest disaster in Israel’s history. One-hundred-and-nine hostages have yet to return, and the living have not been brought back for rehabilitation, nor have the bodies of the murdered been returned for burial,” the forum added. The forum said it would instead join communities of the Gaza border area and southern Israel to mark October 7. Monthslong talks to release the hostages in exchange for a ceasefire in Gaza have repeatedly stalled as mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt ramp up efforts to reach an agreement. Israel insists that it won’t end the war until Hamas is eliminated from Gaza and has demanded that it retain control over the Gaza-Egypt border and restrict the movement of armed men from the south of the strip to its north. Hamas has rejected those demands. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli government press office. This week, the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from tunnels in Gaza in an Israeli military operation in the city of Khan Younis. Israel’s war in Gaza was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,200 people have died in Gaza during the war, according to Palestinian authorities. ‘Do what is right’ Hostage families have repeatedly accused Netanyahu of stalling negotiations and abandoning the captives to keep his governing coalition intact . Hardline ministers in his cabinet have threatened to collapse the government if he agrees to end the war. “Together, we’ll demand the restoration of security, the return of the hostages, the rehabilitation of communities, and an investigation into the failures that led to the terrible disaster of October 7,” the forum said.

According to Israeli public broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate, many of those kibbutzim that were attacked on October 7, including Be’eri, Re’im, Nirim, Kfar Aza, Nahal Oz, Nir Oz, Yad Mordechai and Nir Yitzhak, will boycott the event. Representatives of the towns of Ofakim and Sderot will participate, according to Kan. Leader of Israel’s National Unity party and former war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Wednesday said that it should be the affected communities – and not Regev – organizing the event. “The nature of this day must be determined by those who endured the inferno: the residents of the Western Negev settlements, the hostages and their families, the families of the fallen, and the wounded,” Gantz wrote on X. Addressing Regev, Gantz added: “It is not too late to reconsider and do what is right. Transfer the responsibility for managing the ceremony to the Minister of Culture, establish a joint steering committee with the leaders of the Western Negev communities and the bereaved families, and truly listen to them.”"

On Wednesday, Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported that Israel’s withdrawal from the 8.7-mile strip of land along the border between Gaza and Egypt would be an element of the proposal agreed to by Netanyahu. Blinken and other US officials have declined to detail the “bridging proposal” the US laid out last week, which is designed to bring Israel and Hamas closer to a ceasefire agreement. But Hamas insists that the IDF withdraw fully from Gaza and that citizens must be allowed to return home. Israeli officials counter that a solution must be found to better control the Egypt-Gaza border, which has long been used for smuggling. But the prime minister’s office quickly denied any intention to leave the area, which Israeli troops seized in May. “Israel will insist on the achievement of all of its objectives for the war, as they have been defined by the Security Cabinet, including that Gaza never again constitutes a security threat to Israel. This requires securing the southern border,” his office said in a statement on Wednesday, describing Kan’s reporting as “incorrect.” The statement also appeared to contradict comments by Blinken on Tuesday, when he said that Netanyahu had agreed to the bridging proposal and its proposed troop withdrawals. “The agreement is very clear on the schedule and the locations of IDF withdrawals from Gaza, and Israel has agreed to that,” said Blinken in remarks to reporters before departing Qatar. Blinken was speaking in Qatar at the end of a short trip to the region as the US makes what it hopes is a final push for all sides to agree to a ceasefire agreement that would halt the fighting in Gaza and free the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The top US diplomat said Monday in Israel that the onus would be on Hamas to also agree to the latest proposal to bridge the outstanding issues. A US senior administration official has previously criticized Netanyahu’s reported comments about not withdrawing as “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line.” CIA Director Bill Burns and other senior negotiators are expected to return to Cairo for further high-level talks this weekend. Meanwhile, the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group arrived in the Middle East on Wednesday, according to US Central Command, bolstering US forces as the region braces for a potential Iranian attack. The aircraft carrier was ordered to the Middle East in early August in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Iranian officials vowed to retaliate against Israel for the assassination. On August 11, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the carrier and its accompanying destroyers to accelerate their transit to the Middle East amid widespread concerns that Iran may be preparing for a large-scale, coordinated attack against Israel with its regional proxies. On Tuesday, Iran said that its response to Israel must be “carefully calibrated” to avoid derailing the ceasefire negotiations. But Iran’s mission to the UN made it clear that a response was still coming. “The timing, conditions, and manner of Iran’s response will be meticulously orchestrated to ensure that it occurs at a moment of maximum surprise,” said the Iranian mission in a statement to CNN. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group joins the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group. The USS Theodore Roosevelt is expected to remain in the region for several more days before it returns to the US, according to three US defense officials. The Pentagon previously announced that the USS Abraham Lincoln would replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The US also has the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, several destroyers and the USS Georgia, a guided missile submarine.

The Middle East has been on high alert since last month’s assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, which came the day after Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr was killed in an airstrike in Beirut. Israel took responsibility for the killing of Shukr, but has not confirmed or denied its role in Haniyeh’s death. Iran and its regional allies – Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza – blamed Israel for both killings and promised to retaliate, spurring weeks of high-wire diplomacy to prevent the breakout of a full-scale regional war. CNN video Related video How the failure of America’s Iran deal is now affecting Middle East But the comments from the IRGC spokesman, three weeks on from the twin killings, may indicate a cooling of Iran’s earlier, more bellicose rhetoric. Naeini said Iran’s response could differ from previous operations against Israel, saying that Tehran will not take “hasty action.” “For now, the Zionists must live in instability and Iran’s response may not be a repeat of past operations,” he said. “The response scenarios are not the same. Our commanders have the experience and the art of effectively punishing the enemy and will not take hasty action.” In April, Iran launched some 300 projectiles at Israel – its first-ever direct attack on the country – after blaming it for a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, which killed Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander. Naeini added that “the Zionist regime (Israel) has accepted the defeat, even American politicians have acknowledged this and have not yet achieved any of their goals,” referring to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has been fought for more than 10 months with the aim of defeating Hamas and returning the hostages it took from Israel on October 7. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Monday, August 19. Handout/Maayan Toaf/GPO Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ramped up after the twin killings of Shukr and Haniyeh, as Arab and Western officials sought to avoid an all-out war. Impact on Gaza ceasefire deal There have been some indications that Iran may abandon plans to attack Israel if a ceasefire deal is reached. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said Tuesday that its retaliation against Israel for Haniyeh’s assassination must be “carefully calibrated to avoid any possible adverse impact that could potentially influence a prospective ceasefire.” “The timing, conditions, and manner of Iran’s response will be meticulously orchestrated to ensure that it occurs at a moment of maximum surprise,” the mission said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. The statement came a day after the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said there is “no direct connection” between Iran’s support for reaching a ceasefire deal and its determination to avenge Haniyeh’s killing, according to state news agency ISNA. In an interview in the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday, Mohsen Rezaee, former commander-in-chief of the IRGC, told CNN that “Iranian actions will be very calculated ones,” adding that there has to be a ceasefire in Gaza “soon.” Iranians attend the funeral procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024.

Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters Related article Iran’s mixed signals leave some allies in the dark and set region on edge “The United States and Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If in the first weeks of the Gaza war the United States had stopped Israel and (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, the war would not extend. So the main element of the extension of the war are the US and Israel. The more this war extends the more the United States will be damaged,” he said. Regarding Iran’s response to Israel, Razaee said: “We have investigated the possible repercussions. And we will not let Netanyahu, who is sinking in a swamp, save him himself. The Iranian actions will be very calculated ones.” Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor for the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the IRGC’s statement on Tuesday is unlikely to signal Iran scrapping its plans to attack Israel but rather indicates a decision to delay it. “Iran finds itself between a rock and a hard place right now,” she said, adding that the recently elected government of Masoud Pezeshkian, considered a moderate in the country, would be keen not to look weak domestically by not responding to Israel. She added, however, that the government currently lacks the bandwidth to “invite an escalation spiral right now” as it aims to focus on domestic priorities and de-escalate on the foreign policy front. This approach could shift depending on the outcome of the Gaza ceasefire talks, which Iran is keen not to disrupt, she said. “That also means the negotiations are much higher stakes. So, if they do fail, there’s an even greater incentive for the Iranians to carry out an attack.” After talks resumed last week in Qatar’s capital Doha, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge gaps in ceasefire negotiations, and that “the next important step is for Hamas to say yes” to the same terms ahead of further negotiations expected this week. Some officials have suggested that Tehran is dragging its feet, fearing that its response could trigger a wider war. One diplomat said he believed Hezbollah and Iran had “trapped themselves” in their own vows of reprisals.

In a joint announcement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) named them as Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell and Yagev Buchshtab. All but Munder had been announced dead in recent months by the Israeli military. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a “complex operation” to retrieve the bodies. “We will continue working to achieve the goals of this war - returning the hostages to Israel and dismantling Hamas,” Gallant said on X. A joint statement by the ISA and IDF said the operation was “enabled by precise intelligence” from the two agencies’ intelligence units, and the IDF Intelligence Directorate Hostage Headquarters. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office.

Munder was taken along with his wife, daughter and grandson, who were later freed during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder’s son, Roee, was killed during the attack. Nine-year-old Ohad Munder told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 on Tuesday that the death of his grandfather and the other hostages “shouldn’t have happened.” “There have already been many times when there were negotiations for (a) deal… and then they say no – and in the end they don’t want it, and always regret it at the last minute. All the hostages could have returned alive even on the first day. They could have brought back grandfather and all the other hostages,” Ohad said. Metzger’s wife Tami was also kidnapped and later released in the November truce. Popplewell, who was 51 when abducted, and Buchshtab, 35, were taken from Kibbutz Nirim, the kibbutz said in a statement. In May, Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed Popplewell, a dual British-Israeli citizen, had died more than a month earlier of wounds he sustained after an Israeli airstrike hit the place where he was held. CNN was not able to independently verify the claim by Hamas. The IDF said in July that Buchshtab was believed to have been held in Khan Younis and died several months ago, while the IDF was operating there. It did not detail the circumstances of the death at the time. In a statement Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked those involved in the retrieval operation for their “bravery and determined action.” “Our hearts ache for the terrible loss,” he said. IDF to probe cause of deaths The chief spokesperson of the IDF said Tuesday it was investigating what caused the deaths of the hostages. Earlier on Tuesday, a report in the Israeli media had claimed that some of the fatalities may have been linked to an Israeli military operation in Khan Younis. Israeli outlet Ynet had reported that an IDF preliminary assessment was that the hostages may have died due to suffocation after the IDF hit a nearby Hamas target and carbon dioxide flooded the tunnel where they were being held. Asked in a news conference whether the IDF had killed the hostages, spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari referred back to a statement he made in June, when he had said the “the hostages were killed while our forces were operating in Khan Younis.” However, he did not confirm that the hostages had been killed as a result of Israeli military action. Hagari said the IDF would need to “find out all the details and these bodies are in Israel, they will be brought for burial but were also examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine.” The IDF would inform the families and the public of its findings, Hagari said. The chief spokesperson also said the IDF would not be able to return all hostages through rescue operations, which is why Israel is active “on all channels.” About 1,200 Israelis were killed and some 250 others kidnapped during Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 92,000 injured during Israel’s war in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. Ceasefire talks The news comes as negotiations for a ceasefire continue, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that Netanyahu agreed on Monday to a US “bridging proposal” for a deal after the pair met in Tel Aviv. Mediators presented the bridging proposal to Israel and Hamas last week to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides, a joint statement between the United States, Qatar and Egypt said. Blinken said the next step in the ceasefire talks “is for Hamas to say yes.” He arrived in Egypt on Tuesday for talks with top officials to “get the latest from them on what they are hearing” from Hamas, Blinken said. Further high-level negotiations are expected to resume as soon as this week in either the Egyptian or Qatari capital. The same day, representatives of an Israeli hostage family forum said Netanyahu told them that Israel would not leave the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer strip of land that serves as a buffer zone on the border between Egypt and Gaza, and had also appeared to cast doubt on a hostage and ceasefire deal. Netanyahu said in the meeting that there “might not be a deal,” but the remark came in the context of Hamas potentially ruling out an agreement, the Tikva forum’s Zvika Mor, father of hostage Eitan Mor, told CNN. Mor added that Netanyahu had insisted on maintaining Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor, but had not committed to maintaining control over the Netzarim corridor — which intersects one of Gaza’s two main north-south roads to create a strategic, central junction. Sham Abu Tabaq, age five, saw her father and sister shot dead in front of her. CNN Related article She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter. Then soldiers brought her to an Israeli hospital In a statement released after the meeting, Netanyahu’s office did not directly mention either the prime minister’s reported comments regarding the Philadelphi Corridor or the possibility of no deal. Meanwhile, Hamas rebuked US President Joe Biden’s comments about the group “backing off” from a ceasefire deal. Speaking to reporters outside the Democratic National Convention early Tuesday, Biden said: “Israel says they can work it out, they’re prepared – but I was told Hamas is now backing off. It remains to be seen, we’re going to keep pushing.” Hamas said in a Tuesday statement that “Biden and Blinken’s statements are misleading claims, and do not reflect the true position of the movement, which is keen to reach a cessation of aggression.” “We consider these statements a renewed American green light for the government of Zionist extremists to commit more crimes against defenseless civilians, and in pursuit of the goals of exterminating and displacing our people,” it added. Hamas has previously indicated it will not accept the latest proposal, saying on Sunday that it doesn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions in the prisoner exchange, among other issues. In a statement Sunday, the militant group blamed Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum said Tuesday that the recovery of hostage bodies provided “necessary closure,” and called for urgency to finalize a deal. “The Israeli government, with the assistance of mediators, must do everything in its power to finalize the deal currently on the table,” it said in a statement. Still, Israel’s military operation continues, with airstrikes across Gaza killing at least 40 on Tuesday, officials in the Palestinian enclave said. At least eight people were killed and four people remain missing, according to the Gaza Civil Defense, after an Israeli airstrike targeted a school where authorities said thousands of displaced people were sheltering from violence. Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN most of those killed and injured in the strike on the Mustafa Hafez school were women and children and that a number of people were still under the rubble. The IDF said in a statement that the Israeli Air Force had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control center” inside the school and that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.” Israeli forces have repeatedly targeted schools used as shelters for civilians in Gaza, claiming that Hamas is operating inside the compounds. Later Tuesday, at least nine people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the central city of Deir al-Balah, according to health officials at the city’s Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. Arwa Damon, a former CNN senior international correspondent and president and founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA), who is in central Gaza, heard the strike and saw a number of injured people while she was at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Damon told CNN she saw two blood-covered children, a woman screaming on a stretcher, a man with a massive foot injury and a number of women wailing. In a separate incident, at least four people were killed in a strike on a house in Khan Younis under which a makeshift phone-charging point was located, health officials at Nasser Hospital, which received the casualties, told CNN. The phone-charging station that was hit is one of many in Gaza that sell mobile accessories and allow others to charge their phones for a fee. The stations are primarily for people who live in tents and do not have electricity. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. This story has been updated with additional information.

Blinken was responding to Israeli media reports that Netanyahu told a group of families of terror victims and hostages that he conveyed to Blinken that Israel will not leave the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border and the Netzarim corridor, which bisects Gaza, “regardless of the pressure to do so.” They are “strategic military and political assets,” Netanyahu added, according to the reports. Blinken and other US officials have declined to detail the proposal the US laid out last week. The ceasefire deal is structured in three phases and would eventually include the full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza. But Israeli officials have repeatedly insisted that a solution must be found to better control the Egypt-Gaza border, which has long been used for smuggling. The location of troops in the Philadelphi corridor and the question of whether Palestinians will be able to able to return home in the north have been two of the biggest hurdles in the ceasefire negotiations. Hamas has insisted that the IDF withdraw fully from Gaza and that citizens must be allowed to return home. Blinken said that Netanyahu told him directly in their meeting that Israel agreed to “the bridging proposal and thus the detailed plan” for withdrawal. A US senior administration official strongly pushed back on Netanyahu’s comments about not withdrawing, calling them “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line.” Blinken was speaking in Qatar at the end of a short trip to the region as the US makes what it hopes is a final push for all sides to agree to ceasefire agreement that would halt the fighting in Gaza and free the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The top US diplomat said Monday in Israel that the onus was now on Hamas to also agree to the latest proposal to bridge the outstanding issues. Following top-level meetings in Doha last week, follow on negotiations meant to hammer out the final details of a potential agreement between Hamas and Israel have continued with experts from the different sides. The senior negotiators, including CIA Director Bill Burns, are expected to re-convene in Cairo later in the week or over the weekend. Even as US officials stress the urgency of the need for an agreement, they have begun to downplay the prospects of a full-fledged agreement being reached quickly. On Tuesday, the top US diplomat noted that even if the bridging agreement is agreed by Hamas and Israel, “we also have to complete the detailed implementation agreements that go along with putting the ceasefire into effect” and urged flexibility. Once Hamas agrees to the proposal, Blinken said, it will be “very important that everyone do what’s necessary to bring the flexibility to the table to make sure that we can get the implementation agreed.” Blinken referred back to the so-called Tokyo Principles that state the US will not accept “any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel.” Blinken wrapped his trip the region on Tuesday with stops in Egypt and Qatar. A senior administration official said he had “very productive” meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, and intel chief Abbas Kamel. Blinken was slated to meet with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani in Doha Tuesday night, but the meeting was canceled. A US official said the Qatari leader was unwell. The top US diplomat instead met with Minister of State Dr. Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi. On Monday, Blinken met in Israel with Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog. On Tuesday, Hamas released a statement criticizing both the top US diplomat and President Joe Biden as being “misleading” about the group’s position on a ceasefire agreement. The statement also asserted that mediators in Egypt and Qatar “know that (Hamas) dealt positively and responsibly in all previous rounds of negotiations,” and again blamed Netanyahu for obstruction. A senior administration official on Tuesday suggested that Hamas has not sent a formal response to the bridging proposal, noting that Egypt wants to see a response from the group as soon as possible. The official also stressed that even if both sides agree to the bridging proposal, there will still need to be additional conversations on specific details and technical and implementation commitments. “We fully expect as the conversations will continue, part of the next step if Hamas were to also accept this bridging proposal, is that discussions will continue on some of the more the more technical details,” they said. Still, there is “a fierce urgency of now,” Blinken said Monday, noting that “intervening events come along that may make things even more difficult, if not impossible.” This is “probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken said in remarks earlier Monday."

Behind her dark eyes are memories she has hardly begun to process. She has experienced war. She has been forced from her home. And she was in her father’s arms when he was fatally shot, and saw both him and her older sister left for dead in the street. But this is not your increasingly typical story of tragedy and loss in Gaza . That much is clear from the place where CNN met Sham and her mother, Sanaa: a Palestinian hospital in Jerusalem. And then, there’s this: Sanaa doesn’t just blame the Israeli military for killing her husband and daughter and shooting her in the leg – though certainly she does blame the Israeli military. An Israeli soldier may also have saved her life. That should not be extraordinary. All militaries are obligated under international law to help injured civilians. But in the war in Gaza, stories like Sanaa’s are exceedingly rare. “He had mercy towards us,” she said of the soldier. But he and his comrades, she said, “also took from me the most precious thing I had.” Sham Abu Tabaq, 5, was in her father's arms when he was shot dead, her mother says. CNN Sanaa and her husband Akram – a schoolteacher – lived with their daughters Sham and Yasmeen in Beit Lahia, in the northernmost end of Gaza. She worked at a foundation that provides support for orphans. Like many women in Gaza, she dressed conservatively and often covered her face, which is marked by deep burn scars from a childhood accident. In the days after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, and Israel’s ensuing military campaign, the family were forced from their home – fleeing Israel’s unprecedented bombardment of the Gaza Strip. When a brief ceasefire was announced in late November as part of a hostage release deal, they saw an opportunity to return. “We were so happy we weren’t even able to sleep,” Sanaa recalled. “A truce was happening, and we were going to go home.” They departed the United Nations-run health clinic where they had been living, in the Jabalya refugee camp, and began the roughly three-mile journey on foot. They were almost home, she said, when shots rang out. “It was like there was a sniper and he was shooting at us. We didn’t see him,” she said. “Suddenly we were all injured.” Sanaa Abu Tabaq, who suffered burns as a child, saw her husband and daughter shot dead during the November ceasefire in Gaza. CNN ‘They finished him off’ Seven-year-old Yasmeen’s condition was the most serious. She was shot in the back and shoulder. Akram was struck in the stomach, and Sanaa in the leg. Only Sham was left unscathed by the hail of bullets. Jiab Suleiman distributes food to children living in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, in April.

And Yasmeen was in a very terrible condition – two bullets, and she was all covered in blood. So, I told him, ‘We can’t.’ He said, “I’ll try to crawl.’ So he crawled a little bit. They finished him off! He remained in his place. He was killed,” Sanaa said. For several hours they lay there in the middle of the street – too injured and fearful to move. Sanaa held Yasmeen, promising her daughter that an ambulance was on the way and that they would survive. But no help was on the way. False hope was all Sanaa could offer her daughter in that moment. Life drained out of Yasmeen, and she succumbed to her wounds. Sanaa was unable to retrieve her daughter Yasmeen's body. Sanaa Abu Tabaq “I laid my daughter Yasmeen on the ground, may God bless her soul. And I covered her with a blouse. And I told Sham, ‘Come on darling, let’s crawl.’” Crawling along the ground, speaking in whispers, they left behind the bodies of their family and made it inside a partially bombed two-story house. They huddled in a bathroom as night fell. “In the morning, around 7:30, we heard the sounds of the Israelis and of the tanks,” Sanaa said. “I told her, ‘Sham my darling, the Israelis have come. They are going to shoot us. But don’t be afraid. It’s over. And we are going to die.’ She said, ‘Okay mom, but hide me. I don’t want to see them when they come and shoot me.’” As Sanaa cradled her daughter, an explosion shook the house, blowing in the door of the bathroom where they were huddled and shattering the window above them, sending glass raining down. Soon, the soldiers were inside the house. After some tense moments of shouting, she said, the soldiers were convinced that Sanaa and Sham were not harboring militants and tended to their wounds.

The video, which does not have audio, shows two soldiers applying field dressings as Sanaa – curled in a corner – speaks with someone off-camera. The IDF would not make any of the soldiers concerned available for an interview with CNN. Sanaa soon began pleading with an Arabic-speaking soldier, who denied that his forces had killed Sanaa’s husband and eldest daughter, and instead blamed Hamas and its leader, Yahya Sinwar, for their deaths.

I just want my family to take my daughter.’” “He told me, ‘No, we cannot hand you over to Gaza. Wait a little bit. I might be able to help you,’” Sanaa said. Sanaa says the Israeli soldiers concluded they could not treat her in the field. Her condition was critical, she says, and she needed to be treated in a hospital. After making several calls, she recalled, the Arabic-speaking soldier said they would take them to a hospital in Israel. They carried her out of the house on a stretcher with Sham. As she was being loaded onto a Humvee, Sanaa says she saw her daughter Yasmeen’s body in the street. “I told him: ‘This is Yasmeen. Please bring her to me.’ He said no. I told him, ‘Then, please bury her for me,’” Sanaa recalled. “They kept going with the stretcher.” A shoe on the floor of the house in northern Gaza where Sham and Sanaa sheltered over a terrifying night in November.

Standing in an open area, soldiers doing a security check ordered Sanaa to remove her jilbab – a full-body covering garment – in front of female soldiers, while male soldiers said they would look away. All the while, she continued to bleed from the bullet wound to her leg. “Then they made me lift off my blouse and my undergarment items,” she recalled. “Sham – they took off all her clothes as well.” “If it was not for Sham, I wouldn’t have agreed to take off my clothes. Because I was scared that if I didn’t take off my clothes, they would shoot Sham. Or they would shoot me in front of Sham, and I would never know what happened to her. If I had been alone I would have rather they shoot me, and I wouldn’t have taken off my clothes.” They continued to Kaplan Medical Center, in the central Israeli city of Rehovot, where doctors treated her wounds. CNN obtained Sanaa’s medical files, which show that a bullet pierced her right calf, fracturing both bones and damaging an artery. She was then transported to a Palestinian hospital in Jerusalem to recover. ‘This is God who stood by my side’ For nine months, she has had a slow recovery, with physical therapy. She and Sham have lived in a single, shared hospital room. She has no idea what happened to the bodies of her daughter and husband. It is a vexing limbo – aware of the privilege of their safety yet pining for a home and life that has been irrevocably changed. And she is terrified at being sent back into the warzone that was her home. Indeed, Israeli authorities are now planning on returning the pair to Gaza next month unless another government takes them in, according to hospital officials, Israeli officials and human rights organizations. The Israeli military denies its soldiers shot Sanaa and her family. In a statement to CNN, the IDF said that the family inadvertently approached a concealed Israeli position. When soldiers shouted at the family to stop, their position was revealed to nearby militants, who began firing on the Israelis. The family, the IDF said, was “caught in the intense exchange of fire,” adding that “the troops did not open fire at the four people nor did they aim at them.” A mug with a image of Akram Abu Tabaq, Sham’s father and Sanaa’s husband, who was shot dead while trying to return home during the November ceasefire in Gaza. CNN Sanaa called that claim a lie. The IDF claimed that the militants fired grenades on their position – Sanaa said she did not hear any explosions. “If we had heard the voice of Israelis, we would have fled and returned (to the shelter). If we had heard the voice of resistance, we would have fled and returned,” Sanaa said. “It’s true he helped me,” Sanaa says of the Arab-speaking soldier who helped facilitate the decision to take her out of Gaza, to Israel. But she cannot bring herself to thank him. And she says she would not, if she saw him again. “This was a miracle from God that the soldier who was speaking to me in Arabic was helping me,” she said. “This is God who stood by my side, and He put mercy in them towards me. It is from God,” she said. “Not by (the soldier’s) own will.” Video Ad Feedback Watch CNN’s full video story 06:43 - Source: CNN This story has been updated."

Despite the claims of Netanyahu’s agreement to the bridging proposal, there are still significant challenges before a deal can actually be reached. Not only has Hamas not agreed to the proposal but negotiators are still working on specific details on how an agreement would be implemented. They are also working to establish “clear understandings on how the different parties are going to make good on their commitments,” the top US diplomat said. Ahead of his meetings with Israeli officials Monday, Blinken said the push to finalize a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza has reached a “decisive moment,” as he visited Israel before going on to Egypt and Qatar on Tuesday. This is “probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken said in remarks alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv before the two met. “It is time for everyone to get to yes, and to not look for any excuses to say no,” Blinken said. “It is time for it to get done. It’s also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process.” At his press conference, Blinken underscored the urgency of the moment, noting that “intervening events come along that may make things even more difficult, if not impossible.” “We’ve experienced that throughout this process, so there’s the fierce urgency of now,” he said. The announcement by Blinken and the Israeli prime minister’s office that Israel had agreed to the bridging proposal followed a three-hour meeting between the top US diplomat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem earlier Monday. Both sides described the meeting as constructive. Netanyahu committed to sending senior negotiators to “complete this process” in either Qatar or Egypt, Blinken said. It is unclear what exactly is in the “bridging proposal.” It was put forward last week by the US, with the support of Qatar and Egypt, following two days of high-stakes talks in Doha. The mediators have been stepping up efforts as the Middle East braces for a possible Iranian attack on Israel, and after the death toll since October in Gaza reportedly reached 40,000 people — a bleak figure that underscores 10 months of suffering, malnutrition and despair in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s war with Hamas. On Sunday evening, Hamas and Netanyahu traded accusations suggesting that a deal may still be far off. Hamas suggested it had rejected the proposal. Hamas said the latest proposal didn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions on the exchange of prisoners, among other issues. The group blamed Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached and reiterated its desire to enact a three-phase proposal presented by US President Joe Biden, which would include the release of hostages from Gaza, a “full and complete ceasefire,” and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It called on mediators to “compel the occupation to implement” that plan. Netanyahu shot back, saying Israel will not be “giving in to Hamas’s demand” to end the war in Gaza as a condition of a deal. “The Prime Minister has strongly insisted on this fundamental demand, which is vital to achieving the goals of the war, and Hamas changed its position,” a statement from his office said Sunday. “The Prime Minister will continue to work on advancing a deal that will maximize the number of living hostages and which will enable the achieving of all of the war objectives.” At his news conference Monday, Blinken said he could not “speculate on exactly what Hamas’s intentions are,” but expected to learn more in his conversations with Egyptian and Qatari officials on Tuesday. “We’ve seen public statements, but we’ve seen public statements before that don’t fully reflect where Hamas is,” he said. Other key sticking points in talks include Israel’s insistence on controlling the border between Gaza and Egypt, having a veto over which Palestinian prisoners are released and preventing the movement of armed men from southern Gaza to the north. Death toll continues to rise As the diplomatic efforts continue, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. At least 15 people were killed in two separate Israeli strikes on Gaza Monday, including seven former bodyguards of the late Hamas political bureau leader Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN. The strike on the Al-Shati refugee camp northwest of Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip killed nine people, including the bodyguards, according to Basal. The second strike hit an area behind the Austrian Towers - residential buildings west of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, killing at least six people and injuring 15 others, Basal said. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on both incidents for comment. Separately, an Israeli soldier was killed in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced in a short statement Monday. IDF said earlier Monday that its troops “expanded the operation in the Gaza Strip to the Khan Yunis area and the outskirts of Deir al-Balah,” in a statement. “The troops are eliminating terrorists, destroying combat compounds above and below ground,” the statement added.

Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images A ‘fraught moment’ for Israel Speaking alongside Herzog on Monday, Blinken acknowledged it is a “fraught moment” for Israel over concerns about the possibility of attacks from Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, and said the US has “taken decisive actions… to deter any attacks and if necessary to defend against any attacks.” “We’re working to make sure that there is no escalation, there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places and to greater intensity,” he said. As Blinken arrived in Israel on Sunday, there was an explosion in Tel Aviv that Israeli officials declared to be a terror attack. Hamas’ armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the explosion. In the evening, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed seven members of the same family, medical officials said. Six children and their mother were killed in the strike on a home in Deir al-Balah, according to the Al-Aqsa hospital. The children’s father was injured, a hospital spokesperson said. It comes just a day after an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people, all from the same family, in the al-Zawayda area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Nine children were among those killed, according to the Gaza Civil Defense. In a statement Sunday, the Israeli military said forces continue to operate in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.

Hamas’s armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the explosion, in a statement on its Telegram account. Police said the person suspected of carrying the explosive material was killed, while a passerby sustained injuries. “This was a terror attack involving the explosion of a powerful explosive,” the Israel Police Spokesperson’s Unit and the Shin Bet Spokesperson’s Unit said in a joint statement Monday. “As a result of the explosion, a passerby was moderately injured (according to medical sources) and was transported to receive medical treatment,” it added. A police official told CNN early Monday that “a major disaster was averted, and dozens could have been killed.” The official refused to comment on what may have been the intended target. Later Monday, police in Tel Aviv said that the suspect who carried out the explosion had no criminal record and was unknown to security forces. After the blast, the Tel Aviv District Commander conducted “extensive searches” throughout the greater city area, the joint statement said. Police said they had received dozens of calls reporting the loud explosion on HaLehi Street. Hamas said the “martyrdom operation” was carried out in cooperation with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s armed wing, the Al-Quds Brigades. “The Brigades confirm that martyrdom operations inside the occupied territories will return to the forefront as long as the occupation’s massacres, the displacement of civilians, and the continuation of the policy of assassinations continue,” its statement added. The blast comes as the city remains on high alert amid rising regional tensions related to the war in Gaza. It was unclear whether the act was linked to the complex security situation.

Six children and their mother were killed in the airstrike on a home in Deir al-Balah on Sunday, according to the Al-Aqsa hospital. The children’s father was injured, a hospital spokesperson said. Muhammad Awad Khattab, the children’s grandfather, told CNN: “They were taken by surprise when a missile hit them and completely destroyed their apartment.” “What did they do to deserve this?” he added. “What resistance did they have?” As the war rages in Gaza, Blinken landed in Israel on Sunday night where he will, in the words of a senior administration official, “continue to stress the importance of getting this [deal] done.” The top US diplomat will meet on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and President Isaac Herzog, according to a senior State Department official. Following his meetings in Israel, Blinken will continue on to Egypt on Tuesday. Cairo has been a key negotiator in the ceasefire talks. The fresh strike in Gaza comes just a day after an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people, all from the same famly, in the al-Zawayda area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Nine children were among those killed, according to Gaza Civil Defense. In a statement Sunday, the Israeli military said forces continue to operate in Khan Younis and Dir al-Balah. It said the military struck “targets in the area from which the launches were fired toward Nirim (Friday) and destroyed loaded launchers in the area of Khan Younis.” The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders in north Khan Younis and east Deir al-Balah on Friday, further reducing the boundaries of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone. Palestinians in Gaza have faced constant evacuation orders. According to the UN, since October of last year, more than 80% of the Gaza Strip has been subjected to such orders, severely impacting the local population’s access to essential services and shelter. Israel’s campaign in Gaza – launched following the Hamas attacks of October 7 – has killed more than 40,000 people and reduced much of the territory to rubble. Adding to Gazans’ woes, doctors this week detected the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years. Peace efforts accelerate Blinken’s arrival comes amid urgent efforts to finalize an elusive Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. A new ceasefire plan drawn up by the US, Qatar and Egypt was presented on Friday following two days of high stakes talks in Doha. Mediators have been stepping up efforts amid fears of Iranian retaliation for the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Blinken’s visit has become an established pattern from the top US diplomat of traveling for in-person meetings to project high-level public pressure around the need for an agreement. The senior administration official would not say how the US intends to pressure the Israeli government to take the deal. “Think it is apparent that a deal would not only be in the interest of the Israeli people, but would also help alleviate some of the suffering in Gaza. We’re going to raise all of these issues directly,” they told the press traveling with Blinken. US officials including President Joe Biden have expressed fresh optimism of finalizing a ceasefire agreement. However, Hamas has dismissed the progress, with a senior official from the militant group telling the BBC that mediators were “selling illusions.” In a statement issued on Sunday, the militant group blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached. It said the latest proposal made following high-stakes discussions between mediators in Doha does not include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions in the prisoner exchange, among other issues. “After listening to the mediators about the recent round of talks in Doha, it became clear to us once again that Netanyahu continues to place obstacles to reaching an agreement, sets new conditions and demands in order to thwart the efforts of the mediators and prolong the war,” Hamas said in a statement. “The new proposal meets Netanyahu’s conditions and is in line with them, especially his refusal to a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and his insistence on continuing the occupation of Netzarim Junction and the Rafah Crossing and Philadelphi Corridor. He also introduced new conditions in the prisoner exchange file and backtracked on other terms, hindering the completion of the exchange deal,” the Hamas statement read. “We hold Netanyahu fully responsible for thwarting the mediators’ efforts, obstructing reaching an agreement, and the full responsibility for the lives of his soldiers who are exposed to the same danger our people face, due to his continued aggression and deliberate targeting of all aspects of life in the Gaza Strip,” the statement continued. Hamas reiterated its desire to enact a three-phase proposal introduced by Biden, which would include the release of hostages from Gaza, a “full and complete ceasefire,” and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The organization called on mediators to “compel the occupation to implement” that plan. Previously, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office had said the Israeli negotiating team was still cautiously optimistic about reaching a ceasefire-hostage deal. A statement from the PMO on Saturday said there was “hope that the heavy pressure” on Hamas from the United States and mediators will “allow a breakthrough in negotiations.” Speaking at the beginning of the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel is “holding very complex negotiations” for the release of “our hostages.” Calling the return of hostages a national mission of the highest order, Netanyahu said Israel must negotiate with a “murderous terrorist organization that is unbridled and obstinate.” A statement released later from Netanyahu’s office said Israel would not be “giving in to Hamas’s demand” to end the war in Gaza as a condition of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. “The prime minister has strongly insisted on this fundamental demand, which is vital to achieving the goals of the war, and Hamas changed its position,” the statement said. Netanyahu also insisted on remaining in the Philadelphi Corridor “in order to prevent terrorist elements from rearming.” “The prime minister will continue to work on advancing a deal that will maximize the number of living hostages and which will enable the achieving of all of the war objectives,” the Israeli statement added.

All of those killed in Lebanon were Syrian nationals. A woman and her two children are among the dead, according to the ministry. The strike also wounded at least five. They include three Syrians, one Sudanese and one Lebanese, the ministry said. Two of the Syrians are in critical condition and undergoing surgery at a nearby hospital. Israel’s military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the area of Nabatiyeh overnight. The death toll from the strike is one of the largest in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its war on Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7 that killed around 1,200 people. Mohamed, 14, was about to go to sleep when he saw a missile hit a warehouse nearby. He told CNN that rescuers worked through the night to retrieve the dead bodies from under the rubble, where they found a decapitated body and a severed arm. Pointing to the sky buzzing with the sound of an unseen drone, Mohamed said: “They are always flying over here 24/7, sometimes they fly so low you can see them.” Referring to the victims, who are believed to all be Syrian migrants, Haitham, a Syrian national guard at a nearby company, said: “They escaped one war and got killed in another.” Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon launched a volley of rockets towards Ayelet Hashahar in northern Israel in response to the strike, the group said in a statement.

Aziz Taher/Reuters Israel’s military confirmed that sirens had sounded in Ayelet Hashahar after “approximately 55 projectiles” crossed from Lebanon. “No injuries were reported,” the Israel Defence Forces said. In a separate incident, the IDF said one of its soldiers was severely injured and another lightly wounded after a projectile from Lebanon fell in Misgav Am. Also on Saturday, a drone struck and killed a person on a motorcycle in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, according to Lebanon’s state-owned National News Agency (NNA). Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been exchanging almost daily cross-border fire since Israel launched its war on Gaza, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in 10 months. Tensions between Lebanon and Israel deepened further late last month when an Israeli strike on Lebanese capital Beirut killed the top military commander for Hezbollah, Fu’ad Shukr. Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas’ political leader the next day in Tehran, Iran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in that incident. An industrial area destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Nabatiyeh. Mohammad Zaatari/AP This has prompted speculation of looming retaliatory attacks on Israel by Hezbollah and Iran. Two sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN earlier this month that Hezbollah looks increasingly like it may strike Israel, independent of what Iran may intend to do. Given Lebanon’s proximity to Israel as its direct neighbor to the north, Hezbollah could act with little to no notice, one of the sources said – which is not true of Iran. 15 members of same family killed in Gaza On the ground in Gaza, an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people from the same family in al-Zawayda, in the central part of the enclave, a spokesperson for the local civil defense said Saturday. Nine children were among the dead. CNN video on site shows people searching the rubble and pulling out the body of a child in the morning. When asked by CNN to comment on the incident, the Israeli military said “reports that civilians were injured as a result of the strike is under review.” In a later statement released on Saturday, the IDF said it killed several militants in central Gaza, including one who launched rockets toward Israeli troops. Fighting in Gaza has reduced much of the territory to rubble and displaced almost the entire population. Israel issued new evacuation orders in central Gaza on Saturday, the ninth across Gaza in August alone. The UN has warned such orders severely impact the local population’s access to essential services and shelter. Meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike in the West Bank town of Jenin on Saturday killed two commanders of the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. The Qassam Brigades said the strike had targeted a vehicle carrying the two men, whom it said had planned and executed multiple attacks, including a gunfire attack in the Jordan Valley in the West Bank on August 11 that killed a 23-year-old man. Earlier on Saturday, the IDF confirmed hitting the vehicle, identifying the men killed as “the terrorist Ahmed Abu Arrah from Aqabah” and “the terrorist Raafat Dawasi from Silat al-Harithiya.” ‘Cautious optimism’ on truce talks: Israel On Friday hostage and truce talks ended and are due to resume next week. International mediators presented a new proposal intended to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between Israel and Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Saturday its negotiating team is still cautiously optimistic about reaching a ceasefire-hostage deal. “The team expressed cautious optimism to the prime minister regarding the possibility of moving forward with the deal, based on the latest American proposal (which is based on the May 27 outline) – and includes elements acceptable to Israel,” the office said in a statement. “There is hope that the heavy pressure on Hamas from the United States and the mediators will lead to the removal of its opposition to the American proposal, and will allow a breakthrough in negotiations,” the statement said.

It was the first time members of the Palestinian women’s soccer team had met since the start of the war in Gaza, an ongoing trauma for Palestinians inside and outside the enclave. The team was en route to Dublin, Ireland – the first time a senior Palestinian women’s team had ever played in Europe. “Everyone was crying at the airport because that’s literally the only way for we sisters to meet. No one is playing. People are dying,” the 26-year-old – who plays as a winger for the team – later told CNN on the phone from her home in the West Bank. This season’s Palestinian-based women’s league was slated to start on October 9, 2023, two days after Hamas’ devastating assault on Israel, that prompted a military campaign that has so far killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than a million more. After months of fearing for their relatives and friends inside Gaza, the team finally got their 90 minutes of solace, kicking off against local Irish club Bohemians FC in May. Palestinian soccer player Bisan Abuaita Palestinian Football Association Adding extra significance to the match, it was played on the 76th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba , or catastrophe, during which approximately 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes or were expelled by Jewish militia groups, in violence that accompanied the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Thousands of Palestinian flag-waving fans filled Dalymount Park, with the proceeds going to charitable organizations to help refugees back home. Irish President Michael Higgins was among those in attendance. Just two weeks after the match was played, Ireland would go on to recognize Palestinian statehood , in a coordinated move with two other European nations, Spain and Norway, a decision that was condemned by Israel . Ireland is considered one of the most pro-Palestinian nations in Europe, and earlier this year filed an intervention in the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The Palestinian side won the match 2-1, but the result was less important than the game itself. “Leading the team out was unforgettable,” said 25-year-old captain Mira Natour, a doctor who will soon return to her native Bethlehem in the West Bank, where she works in a government hospital. “It was a moment that filled me with enormous pride and a heavy sense of achievement. Not just for me, but the entire team and our nation. It was a symbol of our resilience; representing Palestine on the international stage despite all the challenges we face.” Palestinian women's team captain Mira Natour Palestinian Football Association Teammate Abuaita, who travels between Bethlehem and France to help displaced Palestinian women and children, described the “surreal” moment of being able to return to competitive soccer. She had barely kicked a ball since her local club won the Palestinian Cup the previous year. “It felt amazing,” she said. “Wearing the kit gives me goosebumps. With what’s happening lately, it’s like double the goosebumps. “Everyone was crying when we heard the national anthem (pre-match) because you remember everything and everyone that you’re playing for. Each one of us knows people who are suffering, who (have been) martyred.” ‘Sisters’ assemble The Palestinian players traveled to Ireland from far and wide – some from their homes in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and others from the global diaspora living thousands of miles from the site of the conflict. Five players from the West Bank, including Abuaita, had to drive to Jordan and fly from Amman. There are no airports in the Palestinian territories and the women would have needed a permit to fly from Israel’s Tel Aviv airport. Even though the distance to Jordan’s Queen Alia Airport is relatively short, three separate security checkpoints along the way meant the trip took around 10 hours, Abuaita said. But at least they could travel. Since the team’s establishment in 2013, there has yet to be a Palestine women’s team member from Gaza, due to Israel’s blockade of the enclave. “Unfortunately, we don’t have players from Gaza on our team. One of the main reasons why is the blockade that was forced upon Gazans since 2007,” said team manager Deema Yousef. “This means citizens cannot leave the strip without a permit granted by the Israeli government, which is extremely hard to obtain,” said Yousef, a representative of the Palestinian Football Association. Other players came from the Palestinian diaspora in Germany, Sweden, Canada and Saudi Arabia.

Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Eighteen-year-old goalkeeper Charlotte Phillips was born in Canada to a Bahamian father and Palestinian mother. Phillips’ grandparents, George and Odette, are Nakba survivors whose family members were killed in front of them, she said. They left Jerusalem in the mid-70s and moved to Canada and went on to open a successful Palestinian restaurant in Toronto, said Phillips, now a university student in Toronto. “I can’t always fully relate to the struggles,” Phillips said. “I know what it means to be Palestinian in Canada, but I don’t know what it means to be Palestinian living in occupied Palestine. So, playing in a game like that in front of my teta (grandmother) and sidi (grandfather) was so significant to our family history.” Nonetheless each meetup of the team, like the match in Ireland, is charged. “It was so incredibly emotional,” Phillips recalled. ‘We are still fighting’ Both Natour and Abuaita described the team’s bittersweet feeling of clocking valuable minutes on the field, while remembering those struggling in war-torn Gaza. Abuaita said her team plays as a mark of respect for those killed in the conflict, and as a reminder to the world that Palestinians are still fighting. “We play for all those people who were killed, for those footballers and athletes who were murdered. And for those athletes who are still unable to play, because in Gaza now there’s zero stadiums – they were all destroyed. Being able to show people we’re here and that we’re still fighting in Palestine is an honor,” she said. Palestinian players celebrate their first goal during the international solidarity match between Bohemians and Palestine at Dalymount Park in Dublin. Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Since the game in Dublin, both the Palestinian men’s and women’s teams have played a handful of international friendly matches, with the former still in contention for a place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada after an impressive outing in the Asian group stages this summer. “Football is a source of hope and unity for our people. It allows us to tell our story – we are more than just a conflict,” captain Natour said. “Most importantly, it inspires the younger generation to dream and strive for a better future, no matter what. When I look at my teammates with diverse backgrounds and unique talents, (I realize) we’re not just athletes but role models and advocates for our country, both on and off the field.”"

Both France and the UK, however, have downplayed such a prospect, with the UK emphasizing the need to break the “current destructive cycle of retaliatory violence” in the Middle East.

Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images When asked about Katz’s statement, a UK foreign office spokesperson stressed that the UK is “working in lockstep with our allies to deescalate tensions,” adding that they “urge all parties to refrain from perpetuating the current destructive cycle of retaliatory violence.” “We call on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that would further escalate regional tensions and jeopardise the opportunity to agree a ceasefire and the release of hostages. No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East,” the spokesperson added. A source with knowledge of Friday’s meeting between the Israeli, French, and UK foreign ministers told CNN that the three ministers “did not discuss joining a coalition for any attack on Iran.” Meanwhile, a senior United States administration official struck a harsher tone, warning on Friday there could be “cataclysmic” consequences and “particularly for Iran” if Tehran decides to strike Israel and escalate the conflict in the Middle East. The death toll in Gaza passed 40,000 people this week, underlining the urgency behind the latest round of talks.

The “bridging proposal” presented on Friday was intended to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides, a joint statement from the US, Qatar and Egypt said. US President Joe Biden expressed optimism about the state of ceasefire and hostage release talks that are expected to resume in Cairo next week. “We are closer than we’ve ever been,” he said, adding that the talks had brought the chances of a deal “much, much closer than it was three days ago.” But the Hamas leadership sees the new US proposal as responding and conforming to Israel’s conditions, a senior Hamas source privy to the details of the negotiations told CNN. The source accused Israel of adding new conditions in order to stall the agreement. Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiating delegation returned to Israel late Friday feeling cautiously optimistic about the prospects of reaching a deal, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. “They narrowed the gaps,” the source said. “These were very productive and positive talks.” The source, however, cautioned that the bridging proposal has yet to be submitted to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza — a process that is expected to occur this weekend. The two days of discussions took place amid tensions across the region about a potential Iranian attack against Israel, which carries the risk of scuppering already fragile negotiations. Biden on Friday also sent a warning message to Iran and Iranian-backed proxies that they should not take any actions “to undermine” the progress of the talks. The US president added that he is sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel this weekend to “reaffirm” the White House’s “iron-clad support for Israel’s security.” Two high-stakes days According to a diplomatic source close to negotiations, the talks were attended both days by CIA director Bill Burns, Mossad chief David Barnea, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence head Abbas Kamel. The joint statement from the US, Qatar and Egypt said the proposal “builds on the areas of agreement over the past week,” and “bridges remaining gaps in a manner that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.” Senior officials from the US, Qatar and Egypt will meet again in Cairo before the end of next week, “with the aim to “conclude the deal under the terms put forward” Friday, the joint statement said. The talks were “serious and constructive,” the statement added, though it did not elaborate on what points of agreement were achieved over the past week. Israel on Friday said it welcomed the mediators’ efforts but did not explicitly endorse the latest proposal on the table. “Israel appreciates the efforts of the US and the mediators to dissuade Hamas from its refusal to a hostage release deal,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement. “Israel’s essential principles are well known to the mediators and the US, and Israel hopes that their pressure will lead Hamas to accept the May 27 principles, so that the details of the agreement can be implemented.” The death toll in Gaza since Israel started its war against Hamas passed 40,000 this week, just as mediators arrived in Doha to discuss a ceasefire. Abed Rahim Khatib/dpa/picture alliance/AP/File Related article High-stakes Gaza ceasefire talks have ended. Here’s what to know Later that evening, an Israeli source told CNN that a working-level delegation has remained in Doha and another working-level delegation is expected to fly to Cairo this weekend to work through the technical details of the implementation of an agreement, the source said. Hamas has not rejected a hostage release deal, as the statement from the PMO suggested. On Thursday it reiterated its stance that there will be no hostage deal or ceasefire agreement without a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The senior Hamas source privy to the details of the negotiations confirmed to CNN that the armed group believes Israel continues to evade and obstruct and insists on adding new conditions to stall the agreement. Hamas did not attend the talks but engaged separately with Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The death toll in Gaza since Israel launched its war against Hamas reached 40,000 people earlier this week, a bleak figure that underscores the desperation in the enclave for a reprieve from ten months of bloody conflict. CNN Related article More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 10 months of war in Gaza, health ministry says But discussions to bring about a pause have been shrouded in uncertainty since Israeli strikes in late July killed Hamas’ former political leader and senior figures in Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. It is understood that both sides have failed to agree on the implementation of the finer details of the proposal. A regional diplomat familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the continued sticking points for Hamas are Israel’s restrictions on the movement of people from southern Gaza to the north, its demand for a veto over which Palestinian prisoners would be released, as well as its continued presence at the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Both Israel and Hamas may be forced to be more flexible in the days ahead in order to reach a deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already facing significant pressure from the US – which is expected to be conveyed during Blinken’s visit to Israel next week – and the Qataris and Egyptians plan on bringing more pressure to bear on Hamas. It is too early to tell if there will be an agreement, but the Israeli source said there is potential for a deal to be announced when top officials convene again mid to late next week. ‘Ready for any possible contingency’ A major Iranian reprisal attack against Israel could still disrupt the ceasefire talks; previous negotiations were at an advanced stage before the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a Hezbollah military commander in Beirut, US officials have said. Iran has blamed on Israel for Haniyeh’s death. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, Iran’s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri expressed skepticism about the integrity of the negotiations, accusing the US of bias in a phone call with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. “By supplying the Zionists with war weapons, the US is itself an accomplice, not a neutral mediator,” Bagheri tweeted. Meanwhile, a senior US administration official has warned that there could be “cataclysmic” consequences and “particularly for Iran” if Tehran decides to strike Israel and escalate the conflict in the Middle East. The official added that the United States has encouraged Iran, through intermediaries, to not attack as there is a “path” to achieve a ceasefire and hostage deal on the table. The de-escalation and potential for a ceasefire deal are “separate,” the official said, but are happening in “parallel.” When asked by CNN’s MJ Lee whether the US would be involved in any attacks on Iran – after Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that he told his British and French counterparts that he expects their nations to attack Iran in the event of an Iranian attack on Israel – the senior administration official sidestepped, saying the situation is “very hypothetical.” “We have deployed the military resources to the region that are needed for every possible contingency, and we’re working in very close coordination with partners and allies,” the official added. “We are ready for any possible contingency, and we’re going to help defend Israel, and not going to get ahead of anything else that.

Blinken’s visit comes on the heels of an initial round of high-level negotiations that wrapped up in Doha on Friday. According to a joint statement from the three main negotiators — the United States, Qatar, and Egypt — the US presented a “bridging proposal” meant to resolve the key gaps remaining between Hamas and Israel in a way “that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.” The statement did not provide specific details about the proposal. “Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Israel on August 17 to continue intensive diplomatic efforts to conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees through the bridging proposal presented today by the United States, with support from Egypt and Qatar,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement. “This proposal would achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, ensure humanitarian assistance is distributed throughout Gaza, and create the conditions for broader regional stability,” he said. “Secretary Blinken will underscore the critical need for all parties in the region to avoid escalation or any other actions that could undermine the ability to finalize an agreement,” Patel said. Blinken’s trip to Israel follows what has become an established pattern from the top US diplomat of traveling for in-person meetings to project high-level public pressure around the need for an agreement. US officials have also consistently argued that a key factor in shifting the Israeli government’s positions related to Gaza has been persistent — and in-person — American engagement. Blinken is expected to meet with key Israeli government officials while in the country. The top US diplomat’s trip follows a parade of other high-level US officials traveling to the region, including CIA Director Bill Burns and top National Security Council official Brett McGurk. The flurry of travel comes as the US and its allies seek to deter a potential retaliatory response from Iran or its proxies for the killing of a top Hamas official in Tehran weeks ago. There are strong concerns that such a response could spark a widespread war."

More than 70 armed settlers invaded the town of Jit on Thursday, firing bullets and tear gas at residents and setting several homes and cars and other property on fire, according to the head of Jit’s village council, Nasser Sedda. Sedda said his cousin, Rashid Sedda, was killed in the attack. The Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health confirmed the 23-year-old Palestinian died after sustaining a chest injury. “We have attacks but nothing to this level,” Sedda told CNN. “We haven’t seen anything like this before, and without a prior warning. They caught the people off guard – women, children, and elders were there.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said dozens of Israeli citizens, some masked, set fires and threw rocks and Molotov cocktails before being dispersed by Israeli security forces. One person has been apprehended for questioning over the rioting, and authorities are looking into the death of the Palestinian resident, the IDF said, without naming the resident.

Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images It is launching a joint investigation into the attack with security agency ISA and Israeli Police. Militant group Hamas on Friday called on Palestinians in the West Bank to “rise up against the crimes of the occupation and to confront the terrorist attacks of settlers” after the raid. “The policy of raids, assassinations, and unleashing herds of settlers will only increase our people’s devotion to their land and sanctities,” it said in a statement. ‘A serious nationalist crime’ Videos of the attack on Jit showed vehicles on fire and flames on the ground floor of a two-story building. Another video shows three medics performing CPR on Rashid Sedda. Residents of the town can be seen running toward the burning vehicles and putting out the flames with a fire extinguisher, while someone shouts, “The settlers attacked us and set fire to the cars.” The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it treated three injuries from settler attacks in the town, including an elderly woman affected by gas inhalation and two young men injured by stones. Disavowal and condemnation came quickly from top Israeli officials. A man standing next to burnt cars points at the damage in his house. Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images A statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack, warning that he views the incident with “utmost severity.” “Those responsible for any offense will be apprehended and tried,” it read. Moshe Arbel, Israel’s interior minister, called the attacks a “serious nationalist crime” that runs “contrary to the values of Judaism,” and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant slammed the “violent, radical riots” as “the opposite of every code and value upheld by the State of Israel.” Israeli soldiers ride in a tank along the border with the Gaza Strip on August 7, 2024.

The attack had harmed “the law-abiding community of settlers and the settlements as a whole and the status of Israel in the world during a particularly sensitive and difficult period,” he said. The attacks meanwhile drew a qualified response from Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister, who said he “told the [IDF] Chief of the General Staff this evening that the fact that we don’t let soldiers shoot any terrorist who throws stones is leading to events of the type that occurred tonight.” “At the same time, it is unequivocally forbidden to take the law into one’s own hands,” he added. Another far-right member of Netanyahu’s government, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “The rioters tonight in Jit are in no way related to the settlements and the settlers. They are criminals who should be dealt with by the law enforcement authorities with the full severity of the law.” Some West Bank settlement leaders also denounced the attacks, seeking to distance themselves from the rioters whom they said were “outsiders.” There has been strong international condemnation too. The European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said the attacks aimed at “terrorizing Palestinian civilians.” “Day after day, in an almost total impunity, Israeli settlers fuel violence in the occupied West Bank, contributing to endanger[ing] any chance of peace,” Borrell wrote in a post on X Friday. Germany’s Foreign Ministry also condemned the attack, writing in a post on X that “this violence is unacceptable and the attacks must stop immediately.” The United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, on Friday called on the Israeli government “to stop settler violence.” A man checks the damage in his house, a day after the attack on the village of Jit. Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images For years, Israeli settlers have attacked Palestinian communities in the occupied territory. From October 7, 2023 to August 5, 2024 alone, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has recorded at least 1,143 settler attacks against Palestinians . Of those, at least 114 attacks “led to Palestinian fatalities and injuries,” according to OCHA. The US imposed a series of sanctions this year on Israeli settlers accused of violence in the West Bank, blocking their financial assets and barring them from entering the US. “The United States remains deeply concerned about extremist violence and instability in the West Bank, which undermines Israel’s own security,” the State Department said in a statement last month. Israeli settlements, primarily inhabited by Jewish Israeli citizens, are built on lands controlled by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. While the international community deems these settlements illegal under international law, Israel disputes this classification. The controversial settler movement has grown in power over the years and is seen by the outside world as a major impediment to peace in the region."

Sign up here. CNN — Mediators in talks for a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel made a last-ditch effort this week to revive stalled negotiations, with high-stakes discussions wrapping up Friday against a backdrop of tension and desperation in the region. The meeting in Doha started on Thursday and has now ended, a diplomat familiar with the discussions told CNN. A breakthrough wasn’t expected but efforts will continue. Technical teams will meet again in the coming days, starting Saturday, until the main figures meet again in Cairo next week, the diplomat said. It took place as the Middle East braces for a possible Iranian attack on Israel , and after the death toll since October in Gaza reached 40,000 people , a bleak figure that underscores 10 months of suffering, malnutrition and despair in the enclave. The fear of an Iranian attack poses a serious threat to any hopes of a ceasefire that have already appeared tenuous in recent weeks, after Israeli strikes took out Hamas’ former political leader and senior figures in Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. But the talks went ahead, despite some initial fears they would be scrapped. Participants on Thursday included CIA director Bill Burns, Mossad chief David Barnea, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence head Abbas Kamel, a diplomatic source close to negotiations told CNN. In the meeting, Qatar, Egypt and the United States were expected to present a plan to implement a deal that could bring about a ceasefire in the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The deal was proposed by US President Joe Biden in May – but unresolved differences have left the path forward unclear. Here’s what we know about the status of the talks. People protest in Tel Aviv ahead of the latest round of talks, calling for a deal that would secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Florion Goga/Reuters What happened in the talks? Mediators presented a bridging proposal to Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides, a joint statement between the US, Qatar and Egypt said on Friday after talks wrapped up for the week. The statement, published by the Egyptian presidency and Qatari foreign ministry, said the proposal presented to both sides “builds on the areas of agreement over the past week,” and “bridges remaining gaps in a manner that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.” The talks were “serious and constructive,” the statement said. CNN video Related video Hear from woman who’s husband is still held by Hamas But the statement did not elaborate on what points of agreement were achieved over the past week. Hamas had said it would not participate in talks but engaged separately with Qatari and Egyptian mediators, a source told CNN, adding that the mediators are still working to bridge the gap on the remaining key differences. “Our position was clear… we will not go for new negotiation rounds. We will only go to implement what has been agreed on,” Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told CNN on Tuesday. On Thursday, the militant group reiterated that there will be no hostage deal or ceasefire agreement without a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. What is Biden’s proposal? In May, Biden laid out a three-phase proposal the administration said was submitted by Israel that would pair a release of hostages from Gaza with a “full and complete ceasefire” and a release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The first phase would last six weeks and include the “withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza” and the “release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners” and the implementation of a temporary truce. CNN Related article More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 10 months of war in Gaza, health ministry says Phase 2 would allow for the “exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers” and a permanent end to the fighting. In Phase 3, a “major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who’ve been killed will be returned to their families,” the US president said. Israel launched its war against Hamas after the group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 100 of those hostages remain in Gaza, their families back home pleading for a breakthrough to secure their safe return. It is unclear how many of the original hostages set for release are still alive. Hamas and Israel have been engaged in tedious negotiations for months. Officials from Qatar and Egypt act as intermediaries, delivering messages to Israeli and Hamas representatives in shuttle-style diplomacy since representatives from the warring parties are not present at the same location. Technical teams have flown in and out of Doha and Cairo to iron out details for a potential agreement. What are the key remaining sticking points? Despite an initial positive reaction from Hamas and Israel, both sides failed to agree on the implementation of the finer details of the proposal including the sequencing of the hostage-prisoner exchange, the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released and how far back Israeli forces should withdraw in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of undermining the deal as far-right members of his ruling coalition threaten to collapse the government despite pressure from the US and families of hostages. Throughout the war, the prime minister has been caught between two potent political forces: the far-right members of his governing coalition who have been opposed to any suggestion that Israeli troops should leave Gaza, and the relatives of hostages held by Hamas, who have formed a powerful pressure group and have implored Netanyahu to reach a deal. US President Joe Biden presents a ceasefire proposal at the White House on May 31. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Last month, the prime minister reversed on a key Israeli concession in ceasefire negotiations, demanding that armed men be barred from returning to northern Gaza during an eventual ceasefire, an Israeli source familiar with the talks told CNN. Israel had previously agreed to allow Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza. Netanyahu’s office on Tuesday rejected claims that the prime minister had changed positions, saying his most recent stance “does not introduce extra conditions and certainly does not contradict or undermine” the May proposal. Netanyahu’s office instead accused Hamas of adding unrealistic demands to its position. A regional diplomat familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the remaining sticking points for Hamas are Israel’s restrictions on the movement of people from southern Gaza to the north, its demand for a veto over which Palestinian prisoners would be released, as well as its continued presence at the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. What is Hamas’ position? US officials had said that talks had reached an advanced stage until Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran in late July in an assassination Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility, but Iran has vowed vengeance. There were concerns that the assassination would throw a wrench in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The militant group replaced Haniyeh with Yahya Sinwar, the hardline Hamas leader in Gaza who is one of Israel’s most wanted men. While Haniyeh, a relative moderate, lived in Qatar and was susceptible to pressure from his host country, Sinwar is believed to be deep underground in a tunnel in Gaza and is hard to reach. Hamas on Thursday denied it was having difficulty communicating with its leader Sinwar, after one of its top officials Osama Hamdan reportedly acknowledged in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday that there are “some difficulties” and delays in communicating with him. Hamas hasn’t ruled out an agreement with Israel, but said that it won’t engage in further negotiations. It instead asked mediators for a plan to implement a ceasefire proposal put forward by Biden. A Hamas source told CNN on Wednesday that the group has adopted a position of “intentional ambiguity” over whether it will attend ceasefire talks, adding that its position on a potential ceasefire is firm whether not it attends the talks. Asked why Hamas has been unclear about whether it will attend the ceasefire talks, the source said: “This ambiguity is the movement’s position, which was announced in its latest statement, is intentional and did not come by chance. It comes as a result of Netanyahu’s behavior.” Why is this round of talks so important? This latest round of ceasefire talks were the result of a major diplomatic effort by mediators Qatar, Egypt and the US to push for a last-ditch effort to end the war and free the hostages as Iran prepares to attack Israel. The urgency of the talks was highlighted by the three mediators, who issued a rare joint statement last week calling on the warring parties to return to negotiations and offered what they called a “final bridge proposal” to overcome the remaining sticking points. The details of that proposal have not been made public.

Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images In parallel, US and Middle East diplomats have been mobilizing to dissuade Iran from launching an attack on Israel that could lead to a wider regional war. Both Iran and the US have said that that lines of communication between them are open through intermediaries. There have been some indications that Iran may abandon plans to attack Israel if a ceasefire deal is reached. But the country’s mission to the United Nations said on Saturday that Tehran’s retaliation is “totally unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire.” As of Tuesday afternoon, US officials didn’t believe that Iran has decided on a course of retaliatory action against Israel, according to two US administration officials. Furious diplomatic backchannel efforts are ongoing to try to deter a wide-scale attack and de-escalate the volatile situation, one of those officials said.

The conversation between Al Thani and Kani was “positive,” a diplomat familiar with the call said. Biden acknowledged the challenges facing a ceasefire deal Tuesday, telling reporters traveling with him to New Orleans he’s “concerned” about negotiations between the two parties amid the looming threat of an attack on Israel from Iran. The president rebuffed questions on what he’s doing to pressure Israel and Hamas to come to the bargaining table for proposed ceasefire deal talks Thursday, telling reporters, “If I told you what pressure tha﻿t I’m putting on it, it wouldn’t be very much pressure would it?” The regional diplomat who spoke to CNN said there is concern that Iran may not hold back on striking Israel, as the diplomat believes the Biden administration is not applying enough pressure on Netanyahu to reach an agreement. The lack of clarity on whether the Israeli prime minister will adhere to Biden’s May proposal, the source added, suggests time is running out to strike a deal before an Iranian attack. Qatar and Egypt, the source said, may not have enough influence to push Hamas to compromise. This story has been updated.

The ministry said 40 people had died in Gaza during the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths since October 7 to 40,005 – about one in every 55 people in the enclave. More than 92,401 have been injured. The health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its figures but says most of the dead are women and children. Israel said last month that it had killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers.

Ali Jadallah/Anadolu/Getty Images In addition, at least another 10,000 people are missing and believed to be buried under rubble in Gaza, the Gaza government’s media office said earlier this week. The soaring figures give a window into the daily suffering , malnutrition and volatility in Gaza after 10 months of conflict. United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has described it as “a very grim milestone at the world’s watch,” on X, adding that it is “a direct result of a collective failure to reach a ceasefire.” And the milestone has been passed at a particularly unpredictable point in the conflict. A new round of ceasefire talks are due to begin Thursday, after the killings of senior figures in Hamas and the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah upended the leadership of both organizations and made the negotiations appear precarious. The news follows an especially deadly weekend for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. At least 93 people were killed overnight into Saturday when an Israeli strike hit a school and mosque in the eastern part of Gaza City where displaced people were sheltering, according to local officials. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed to CNN that it hit the compound, saying its air force “precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control center embedded” in the building. Israeli military officials have said they try to minimize harm to civilians in Gaza and that Hamas bears the blame for using civilians as “human shields.” People check the damage inside a school used as a temporary shelter for displaced Palestinians in Gaza City, following an Israeli strike on August 10. Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed to CNN that it hit the compound and said that “at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated” in the strike. It later said it had identified 12 more militants who were killed in the strike. The strike was almost universally condemned, including by some of Israel’s closest allies. Thursday marks “a grim milestone for the world,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said after the figures were announced. “Most of the dead are women and children. This unimaginable situation is overwhelmingly due to recurring failures by the Israeli Defense Forces to comply with the rules of war.” Fading hopes for a ceasefire Israel launched its war against Hamas after the militant group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 100 of those hostages remain in Gaza, their families back home pleading for a breakthrough to secure their safe return. Hopes of a hostage-for-ceasefire agreement seemed to diminish in recent weeks after Israel launched a series of strikes against senior figures in Hamas and in Hezbollah, which has been sparring with Israel on a near-daily basis since October, in solidarity with Hamas. But Egyptian and Qatari mediators have conveyed to Israeli officials in recent days that Yahya Sinwar, the new head of its political bureau following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, wants a ceasefire deal, an Israeli source familiar with the matter said. Israel said it would send a delegation to the talks. Hamas, however, has said it will not participate in talks Thursday but is willing to speak to mediators afterwards if there are “developments or a serious response from Israel,” the source told CNN.

Florion Goga/Reuters A hardliner and, according to Israel, one of the masterminds behind the deadly October 7 terror attacks, Sinwar was previously believed to be dismissive of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Hamas said Sunday it has asked mediators to implement a ceasefire plan based on previous ceasefire talks such as those put forward by US President Joe Biden and the UN Security Council in July. International pressure is intensifying for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas. A drumbeat of Western criticism of Netanyahu’s actions has grown louder in recent weeks, with the election of a Labour government in the United Kingdom and the confirmation of US Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for November’s presidential election. Harris’ comments on Gaza signal a shift in tone from Biden’s steady support of Israel. US Vice President Kamala Harris meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 25. Nathan Howard/Reuters Harris said Saturday that “far too many” civilians have been killed in Gaza, saying a deal “needs to get done now.” And Netanyahu faces anger from some quarters at home. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a powerful voice in Israel, has for months repeatedly called on Israel and Hamas to finalize a hostage-and-ceasefire deal. “A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home. Time is running out. The hostages have no more to spare. A deal must be signed now!” the forum said in a statement last week . A humanitarian catastrophe A ceasefire deal would provide a reprieve for the approximately 2.2 million Palestinians who have been living in nightmarish conditions in Gaza. Nearly everyone living in Gaza has been displaced in the conflict, with many people forced to flee repeatedly as the Israeli military operation expanded, often into places it previously said had been cleared of Hamas fighters. In recent days, some 75,000 people southwest Gaza after Israeli evacuation orders were issued, according to UNRWA chief Lazzarini. Displaced Palestinians flee from Hamad City following an evacuation order by the Israeli army to leave parts of the southern area of Khan Younis, on Sunday, August 11. Abdel Kareem Hana/AP Less than a sixth of the area of Gaza is not under Israeli evacuation orders, Lazzarini said late last month. “Quite often, people have just a few hours to pack whatever they can & start all over again, mostly on foot or on a crowded donkey cart for those who can afford it,” he said Sunday on the social media platform X. So dire are conditions in Gaza that gravediggers in the enclave are struggling to find space to bury those who have died. A grave digger in Khan Younis, Najy Abu Hateb, told Reuters he is “exhausted.” “Since the war began, we haven’t stopped for even a minute, and we hope the war ends … there’s no place (to bury people),” Hateb said. Hateb said gravediggers have been forced to dig up old graves to bury the new bodies. “We have reached a situation that forced us to bury people even with sand, placing bodies on top of one another,” he added. Earlier this week Fikr Shalltoot, the Gaza Director for aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians, said the impending milestone “means that 40,000 families are grieving, and their hearts are broken.” “Many people are losing hope and some are losing faith, but mostly people are losing trust in the international community. They are angry and disappointed and believe that the world has failed them and let them down,” she said in a statement. This story has been updated.

Hashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen has been charged with four counts of threatening to use explosives and one count of destruction of an energy facility, and is being held behind bars pending a resolution in the case. According to court records, Hnaihen began smashing the windows of several businesses in the Orlando area and leaving “warning letters” threatening to “destroy or explode everything here in whole America. Especially the companies and factories that support the racist state of Israel.” Hnaihen also attacked a Florida solar panel farm, smashing panels and cutting wires, court records say. According to court documents, beginning around June 2024, Hnaihen targeted and attacked businesses in the Orlando area for their perceived support for Israel. This photo shows damage and one of the targeted businesses. US Department of Justice “The solar farm’s engineers and law enforcement investigators quickly realized that Hnaihen’s attack bore signs of premeditation and sophistication,” prosecutors wrote in a detention memo. “For example, whenever Hnaihen cut a wire, he would cut so close to the panel that it was impossible to splice in a new wire, permanently decommissioning the entire panel.” In two hours, he caused $700,000 in damages, prosecutors say. CNN has reached out to a defense lawyer for Hnaihen. Hnaihen also attempted to purchase a firearm and lied about his lack of US citizenship, prosecutors say. During a background check, however, prosecutors say the issue was discovered and Hnaihen was not able to purchase the weapon. Prosecutors warned the judge presiding over the case that Hnaihen’s alleged threats and destruction were escalating in recent weeks.

US Department of Justice “The Court should be aware that on July 9, 2024, two days before the Orange County Sheriff’s Office arrested Hnaihen, employees at an industrial propane gas depot in Orlando, Florida, discovered an identical copy of the defendant’s Warning Letter posted outside the facility,” prosecutors wrote to the judge when requesting that Hnaihen remain behind bars. “No damage was discovered at that time, but operations at the facility were significantly disrupted while a fire department hazmat team cleared the scene,” prosecutors wrote. “Final fingerprint analysis is forthcoming.”"

The city woke up the next morning to find that another Iran-supported official, Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh , had been killed in an assassination in the heart of the Iranian capital, Tehran. The chances of war, for months stowed away into the deeper crevices of this city’s psyche, had grown manifold. “Do you think I am sitting in Hezbollah’s war room?” said one exasperated political leader with ties to the powerful Beirut-based armed group. “I have no idea what’s going to happen next. You probably know more than I do.” Other officials in contact with Iran and Hezbollah said they were similarly in the dark as to how Tehran and its allied non-state fighting groups might deliver the “severe revenge” its top military officials, and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have promised. The death toll in Gaza since Israel started its war against Hamas passed 40,000 this week, just as mediators arrived in Doha to discuss a ceasefire. Abed Rahim Khatib/dpa/picture alliance/AP/File Related article High-stakes Gaza ceasefire talks resume this week. Here are the main obstacles to a deal Israel said the attack in Beirut served as a response to a rocket strike that killed 12 children in the town of Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which it blamed on Hezbollah. Hezbollah has vehemently denied the charge. In his televised addresses since then, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said a response to the attack in southern Beirut was “inevitable,” dismissing Western attempts to prevent a retaliatory strike as futile. But he was scant on the details. “God willing, our response is coming,” Nasrallah declared solemnly in one address. “We may act alone, or we may act with the axis,” he said, referring to the Iran-backed network of armed groups that span Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. The alliance of fighting groups has been referred to by some Israeli commentators as a “ring of fire” around Israel – no match for Israel’s military might but with a strategic depth that sends jitters through the country as it awaits Hezbollah and Iran’s anticipated attacks. The messaging from Iran and its powerful non-state partner seems cryptic by design. Nasrallah and his backers have touted the benefits of the “psychological war” in which Israelis brace for an attack, with little sense of when that might come and what form it might take. But there are also indications that Tehran is dragging its feet, held back by the prospect of triggering a wider war. One diplomat said he believed that Hezbollah and Iran had “trapped themselves” in their own vows of reprisals. Some have suggested that a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza may serve as an off-ramp, as the international community gears up for talks in Doha on Thursday. Iran has rejected the idea. Iranians attend the funeral procession of assassinated Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024. Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters A region kept on high alert The consequences of any reprisal are difficult to foresee. Both Iran and Hezbollah are looking to thread an extremely narrow needle, where they produce enough impact to deter future attacks on the Lebanese and Iranian capitals but stop short of igniting an all-out war. This may prove impossible. There is a widespread view that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must keep a war going in order to keep his growing domestic problems at bay. Iran, its non-state actors, and even the international community, appear powerless to stop it. “It is highly questionable whether there is any deterrence to be re-established,” said Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj.media, an online outlet covering the region. “This is going to go on, and over time this is going to be very dangerous.” It is possible that Iran and Hezbollah may have come to terms with this, recognizing that the open-endedness of their messaging around the anticipated response may be the strongest weapon at their disposal. Rockets fired from southern Lebanon are intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system in northern Israel, August 4, 2024. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images On most nights over the last two weeks, Israeli and US officials sounded alarms about an imminent response. This has not yet come to pass. It draws a striking contrast with the last time the region was on the brink of an all-out war, when Iran responded in April to an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus with a massive swarm of airborne weapons that were largely shot down by Israel and its allies. In the days that led up to that attack, diplomats and officials close to Hezbollah to whom CNN spoke in Lebanon had a rough idea about what Iran’s retaliation would look like: a show of force calibrated to cause very limited damage. Their estimates about the timeframe were largely accurate. Iran at the time was telegraphing its next move through US allies in the region. Today, there is no evidence of that happening. “There’s definitely an element of psychological warfare to this delay,” said Shabani. “But while you’re keeping the Israelis guessing, you’re also keeping the Lebanese and the Iranians on alert.” Uncharacteristically, Nasrallah conceded in his last speech that the killing of Shukr and Haniyeh must be considered “successes scored by Israel.” That sense of failure is palpable in Lebanon and in Tehran, where political tensions are on the rise and the economy has taken a hit.

Chris McGrath/Getty Images In Tehran, the Haniyeh assassination happened a day after the inauguration of Iran’s first reformist president in decades, Masoud Pezeshkian. Western analysts said Pezeshkian’s election could remedy rifts with the West. But the attack that killed Haniyeh has put a damper on those hopes. In Beirut, the summer season is normally a boon for the struggling economy. Fireworks that lit up the night sky in the days leading up to Israel’s attack in southern Beirut have given way to sonic booms produced by Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier overhead, shaking windows and keeping frightened Lebanese families at home. “I cannot think about what happens next,” said the political leader with ties to Hezbollah who CNN spoke to. “All I can do is make the appropriate preparations to help my community in case the worst happens.” CNN’s Ben Wedeman, Sarah El Sirgany, Crendon Greenway and Charbel Mallo contributed reporting."

Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Since then, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians – including more than 16,400 children – and wounded more than 92,000, the ministry reported. ‘Unrelenting’ war on children Al Qumsan is one of hundreds of thousands of survivors who have no time to mourn their loved ones against the backdrop of a 10-month Israeli offensive that has killed entire families, deepened a humanitarian crisis , and turned cities into wastelands .

Israeli media reported this week that Gallant, speaking to lawmakers in a private security briefing, had dismissed Netanyahu’s war aim of achieving “absolute victory” over Hamas as “gibberish,” branding those who say this is achievable as “heroes with war drums.” Netanyahu’s office shot back, saying Gallant’s comments jeopardize talks to release the hostages held in Gaza. “When Gallant adopts the anti-Israel narrative, he harms the chances of reaching a hostage deal,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. It said Gallant was obligated to pursue the twin goals of Israel’s war in Gaza: Eliminating Hamas and the release of the hostages seized by Hamas in the October 7 attacks. The barbed exchange is the latest in a series of spats between the two men during more than 10 months of war, and comes as Israel has been bracing for a possible attack by Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon. That has prompted the United States to bolster Israel’s defenses, sending a guided missile submarine to the region over the weekend.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to avenge the killings last month of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh , who died in an explosion in Tehran, and of Hezbollah’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr , who was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in a Beirut suburb. Iran blamed Haniyeh’s death on Israel, and a source familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Haniyeh was assassinated with an explosive device hidden in the guest house where he was staying. The death of Haniyeh, who had been a key player in ceasefire talks, threatened to derail the negotiations to halt the war in Gaza and escalate the conflict, with Iran warning that “blood vengeance” for the killing was “certain.” Hezbollah also promised that Shukr’s blood “will not have been shed in vain” and threatened to retaliate, forcing Israel to confront the prospect of a war on multiple fronts.

Mahmoud Issa/Reuters Related article Israel and US brace for Iranian attack as diplomats push hard for Gaza ceasefire Critics have accused Netanyahu of being more interested in defeating Hamas and preserving his government than returning the hostages. Far-right members of his coalition have threatened to collapse the government should a deal go through. There is growing frustration in the international community with some of these far-right ministers, as Western leaders push for a deal. On Monday, the European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell told CNN he would put forward a proposal at the EU to sanction far-right Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir. Borrell had called for sanctions against Smotrich and Ben Gvir in a post on X, days after Smotrich said it would be “moral” to starve two million Gazans until Israeli hostages are freed. “The EU has no taboo in activating its Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime against any individual involved in serious violations of Human Rights, like the Hamas operatives and extremist Israeli settlers we already sanctioned,” Borrell told CNN in a statement on Monday. “Since last October, Ministers Smotrich and Ben-Gvir statements inciting to hate and activities related to humanitarian aid clearly fall into this category,” the EU foreign policy chief added. A group of hostage families on Saturday accused the prime minister of “ gambling ” with the lives of the hostages to ensure that his government survives, according to the Times of Israel. The US, Egypt and Qatar – key mediators in talks between the warring parties – have urged Israel and Hamas to return to the negotiating table to consider a “final bridging proposal.” Discussions are set to resume Thursday in the Egyptian capital Cairo or the Qatari capital Doha. Deepening schism Gallant, who has emerged as a top interlocutor for advisers to US President Joe Biden, has often stressed the need for a ceasefire deal. He has previously called on Netanyahu to declare that Israel would not establish civilian or military control over Gaza, although the prime minister has remained vague on his plans for the “day after” the war. In his leaked comments, Gallant also claimed he had in October proposed a pre-emptive attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that Netanyahu had not supported the strike and had missed the opportunity. “The conditions today for a Lebanon war are the opposite of what they were at the beginning of the war,” Gallant reportedly told lawmakers. Responding to Gallant’s claims, Netanyahu’s office deflected blame for the failure to reach a ceasefire deal, saying Gallant “should have attacked (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar, who refuses to send a delegation to the negotiations, and who was and remains the only obstacle to the hostage deal.” In a later post on X, a chastened Gallant said he had told the private meeting that he is “determined to meet the goals of the war and to continue the fighting until Hamas is dismantled and the hostages return,” and also criticized the leaks from “sensitive and confidential forums.” Israeli soldiers walk past Palestinians fleeing the north along the Salaheddin road in the Zeitoun district on the southern outskirts of Gaza City on November 28, 2023.

In June, top military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the idea that Israel could “make Hamas vanish” is “throwing sand in the eyes of the public.” CNN recently reported that nearly half of Hamas’ military battalions in northern and central Gaza have rebuilt some of their fighting capabilities, despite Israel’s unrelenting assault, according to a joint analysis with the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project and the Institute for the Study of War."

The F-15 sale is believed to be the biggest weapons package for Israel and was announced alongside approved potential sales of medium tactical vehicles, medium-range air-to-air missiles, high-explosive mortar cartridges and tank cartridges. The notification of the State Department approval of those sales went to Congress on Tuesday, news releases from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said. Weapons sales must be approved by Congress. In most circumstances, the administration formally informs Congress of the intended arms sales after informal discussions with the heads of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees. Once the sales are formally notified, as they were on Tuesday, lawmakers have 30 days to block them. They can do that by passing a joint resolution of disapproval. Deliveries of the equipment will not begin for years. The aircraft, for example, are not expected to be delivered until 2029. Two key congressional Democrats gave their approval for the significant F-15 sale in June. CNN reported Friday that the State Department notified lawmakers it was providing $3.5 billion to Israel for the use of purchasing US weapons and military equipment. Although the weapons will not be delivered for years, the sale is nonetheless likely to provoke an outcry from critics of the Biden administration’s policies toward the war in Gaza. The US government has come under sharp scrutiny for what some say is a failure to pressure Israel on its prosecution of the war, which has killed tens of thousands in the Palestinian enclave. The announcement of the sales comes amid significantly heightened tensions in the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation against Israel after the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Israel has not commented on the killing. It also comes ahead of the expected resumption of ceasefire talks later this week, and just days after an Israeli strike on a mosque and school in Gaza killed at least 93 people . Gaza’s Ministry of Health estimates nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas. The United Nations estimates nearly 2 million people have been displaced. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a post on X on Tuesday for “advancing critical force buildup initiatives that assist Israel in developing and maintaining its qualitative military edge in the region.” “As we fight to defend Israel on 7 different fronts, your message of support and commitment to Israel’s security, are clear,” he said. In total, the approved sales announced Tuesday included up to 50 F-15IA multi-role fighter aircraft , and mid-life update modification kits of fighter jets and other related equipment, valued at $18.82 billion; 30 AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) and one AMRAAM guidance section for an estimated $102.5 million ; 32,739 120mm tank cartridges and other equipment for an estimated $774.1 million ; 50,000 High Explosive mortar cartridges and related equipment for an estimated $61.1 million ; and an unclear number of modified Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles 8-ton cargo trucks and related equipment for an estimated $583.1 million .

Fitch kept a negative outlook on the country’s credit, meaning it could cut the rating again in the future, as it notched down the credit rating from “A+” to “A.” The downgrade underscores the financial toll of the war, which has also seen tens of thousands of people killed and has shaken the region and the world. Analysts from Fitch said the “the conflict in Gaza could last well into 2025,” and there are risks of the conflict spreading. “The downgrade to ‘A’ reflects the impact of the continuation of the war in Gaza, heightened geopolitical risks and military operations on multiple fronts,” Fitch said in a statement. Israeli military action in Gaza has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, after Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7. At least 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel that day, and more than 250 others abducted in the Hamas-led assault, according to Israeli authorities. Responding to Fitch’s decision, Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the rating downgrade was “natural” given the war and geopolitical risks but added that the country’s economy remained strong. “Israel’s economy is strong and we are navigating it correctly and responsibly,” Smotrich said Tuesday in a post on X, adding that “the economic indicators point to the economy’s robustness and the high trust we have in the markets.” As ceasefire negotiations remain in limbo , an Israeli air strike killed at least 93 Palestinians in a school and mosque in Gaza sheltering displaced people, according to local officials over the weekend. The United States is also set to provide Israel with $3.5 billion in military aid , CNN reported. “In addition to human losses, (the conflict in Gaza) could result in significant additional military spending, destruction of infrastructure and more sustained damage to economic activity and investment, leading to a further deterioration of Israel’s credit metrics,” Fitch said.

The central government’s budget deficit is centered on military operations, mitigating economic disruptions, and also relocation expenses for the northern part of Israel as the potential for another front with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah looms in the coming weeks. ﻿Fitch also expects Israel’s debt-to-GDP to remain above 70% into 2025, whereas the median A rating ratio is 55%. Fitch said a de-escalation of the conflict and fiscal reforms that lower the debt-to-GDP ratio could help the the country get its rating back up. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Israel’s credit rating from A1 to A2, also still investment grade, in February. Moody’s said the primary driver of its decision was an “assessment that the ongoing military conflict with Hamas, its aftermath and wider consequences materially raise political risk for Israel as well as weaken its executive and legislative institutions and its fiscal strength, for the foreseeable future.” CNN’s Samantha Delouya and Irene Nasser contributed reporting.

Mediators have urged Israel and Hamas to return to the negotiating table in a renewed push to strike a ceasefire deal after the talks risked being derailed by the recent assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders which Iran and its Lebanese proxy have vowed to avenge. Negotiations are set to resume in the Egyptian capital Cairo or the Qatari capital Doha on Thursday. Last week, the United States, Egypt and Qatar – key mediators in talks between Israel and Hamas – said they will use the meeting to present a “ final bridging proposal ” and urged both sides to attend. A major Iranian attack reprisal against Israel could risk disrupting the ceasefire talks that US officials have said were at an advanced stage prior to the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. In a joint statement Sunday evening, France, Germany and the United Kingdom endorsed the calls for the warring parties to strike a deal, saying “there can be no further delay” given the simmering threat of a regional conflagration. The White House said Monday that it shares Israel’s concerns and expectations about an attack from Iran in the coming days, pointing to increased American force posture in the region as preparation for an Iranian reprisal. “It’s difficult to ascertain, at this particular time, if there is an attack by Iran and its proxies what that would look like,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. But State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a separate press briefing Monday: “We fully expect these talks to continue to move forward.” Patel would not say outright who the US believes is the biggest obstacle to achieving a deal, but said that the onus is on Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. Israel said it will send a delegation to the Thursday talks, but Hamas hasn’t confirmed its attendance, even if it has signaled that it still wants a deal. Following Haniyeh’s assassination, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain,” and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that “blood vengeance” for the killing is “certain.” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian furthered those threats on Monday, telling a Vatican official in a phone call that the assassination warrants Iran’s right to “self defense” and to “respond to an aggressor,” Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. There have been some indications that Iran may abandon plans to attack Israel if a ceasefire deal is reached. But the country’s mission to the United Nations said on Saturday that Tehran’s retaliation to Israel’s suspected killing of Haniyeh is “totally unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire,” adding that it has a right to self-defense. The US and Israel continued preparations for that scenario over the weekend. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a guided missile submarine, the USS Georgia, to the Middle East and accelerated the arrival of a carrier strike group to the region, the Pentagon said Sunday evening. The US also released $3.5 billion to Israel to spend on US weapons and military equipment, months after it was appropriated by Congress. And on Monday, the Israeli military suspended vacation flights for permanent personnel in anticipation of an attack. Iran’s UN mission said it hopes that its attack on Israel “will be timed and conducted in a manner not to the detriment of the potential ceasefire.” “Direct and intermediary official channels to exchange messages have always existed between Iran and the United States, the details of which both parties prefer to remain untold,” it added.

William Gore/US Navy/Reuters/File Meanwhile, Hezbollah – the Iran-backed militant group in southern Lebanon – fired a barrage of about 30 rockets toward northern Israel Sunday night. Although rocket fire toward Israel from Lebanon has become a near-daily occurrence since the outbreak of war in Gaza, Israeli officials fear a larger-scale response from Hezbollah after the assassination of the group’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr in a Beirut suburb last month But as the world watched Iranian airspace and the Israel-Lebanon border, the worst of the weekend’s fighting was again confined to the Gaza Strip, as an Israeli strike on a mosque and school in Gaza City killed at least 93 Palestinians on Saturday, according to local officials. With the number of Palestinians killed during 10 months of war edging closer to 40,000, Israel’s strike sparked global condemnation. Qatar and Egypt condemned the strike, calling it a violation of international law, and the US National Security Council said the White House was “deeply concerned” about reports of civilian casualties.” In the aftermath, the three mediators renewed their calls for the warring parties to agree to a ceasefire deal. Although the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters, the strike was a reminder that, despite its earlier claims to have dismantled Hamas in the north of the Strip, the militant group has reassembled in areas previously deemed clear. Palestinians pray next to the bodies of those killed in an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City on Saturday. Abed Sabah/Reuters Renewed talks After Haniyeh’s assassination, Hamas named Yahya Sinwar – its leader in Gaza and one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack on Israel – as the new head of its political bureau, suggesting that Hamas’ most extreme faction had taken over, further dimming hopes of a ceasefire deal. But, following the call from mediators last week to return to talks, Hamas requested a plan to implement the existing offer proposed by US President Joe Biden in July, rather than pursuing additional negotiations. “Out of concern and responsibility towards our people and their interests, the movement demands the mediators to present a plan to implement what they presented to the movement and agreed upon on July 2, 2024, based on Biden’s vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and to compel the occupation (Israel) to do so, instead of going for further negotiation rounds or new proposals,” Hamas said in a statement Sunday. A regional source familiar with the talks told CNN on Monday that Hamas is planning to attend the diplomatic talks. The organization’s mixed messaging comes as each side involved in the negotiations positions itself to try to take advantage and pressure opponents in the run-up to the high-stakes talks. Egyptian and Qatari mediators have told Israel that Sinwar wants a deal, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN. The source said that US officials have made clear to their Israeli counterparts that the time to strike a deal is now, in order to prevent a regional war. But, despite growing pressure at home to help bring the hostages home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stymied attempts to reach an agreement. “Nobody knows what Bibi wants,” one Israeli source said, calling Netanyahu by his nickname. Netanyahu accused his defense minister Yoav Gallant of adopting an “anti-Israel narrative” following reports in Israeli media about a closed meeting Gallant had with parliament. Gallant allegedly told lawmakers that last October he had proposed to preemptively attack Hezbollah in Lebanon, that Netanyahu had not supported the strike, and that current conditions for such a strike have now changed. He also allegedly called Netanyahu’s “absolute victory” line, a slogan regularly used by the prime minister, “nonsense”. The comments irked Netanyahu, prompting him to issue the statement criticizing the Israeli defense minister. “He should have attacked Sinwar, who refuses to send a delegation to the negotiations, and who was and remains the only obstacle to the hostage deal,” Netanyahu said in a written statement. Gallant responded to the critcism on X, saying: “I’m determined to meet the goals of the war and to continue the fighting until Hamas is dismantled and the hostages return.” Though not directly addressing his leaked comments, Gallant said leaks from “sensitive and confidential forums” was one of the “weak points that were discovered during the war” and that “we must act against it with all severity.” “We are facing challenging days in which we’ll be required to stand firm and take powerful defensive and offensive actions,” Gallant said.

Whether the Israeli prime minister wants one remains shrouded in uncertainty. Netanyahu’s allies have told journalists and other government officials that the Israeli prime minister is ready to make a deal, regardless of the impact on his governing coalition, two Israeli sources said. But the Israeli security establishment remains considerably more skeptical of Netanyahu’s willingness to strike a deal given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. Yahya Sinwar was made the political leader of Hamas. Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images/File Related article Hamas names Oct. 7 architect Yahya Sinwar new political leader. What does it mean for ceasefire talks? “Nobody knows what Bibi wants,” one Israeli source said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. What is clear is that Netanyahu is going to face a mountain of pressure this week from the United States to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal. But even as the mediators told Israel that Sinwar wants a deal, Hamas on Sunday cast doubt on its participation in the next round of ceasefire negotiations scheduled for Thursday, saying it has asked mediators to implement a ceasefire plan based on previous ceasefire talks such as those put forward by US President Joe Biden and the UN Security Council in July. “Out of concern and responsibility towards our people and their interests, the movement demands the mediators to present a plan to implement what they presented to the movement and agreed upon on July 2, 2024, based on Biden’s vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and to compel the occupation to do so, instead of going for further negotiation rounds or new proposals,” the Hamas statement reads. Hamas indicated that its latest stance was influenced by an Israeli attack Saturday on a school in Gaza that killed at least 93 people , according to local officials. US officials have made clear to their Israeli counterparts they believe the time to reach a ceasefire deal is now, in order to avoid a wider regional war, the Israeli source said. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a powerful voice in Israel, has also called on Israel and Hamas to finalize a hostage and ceasefire deal. “A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home. Time is running out. The hostages have no more to spare. A deal must be signed now!”, the forum said in a statement on Thursday. At the same time, Netanyahu’s coalition partners have made it clear they do not want Israel to strike a deal with Hamas. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called the proposed ceasefire deal a “surrender deal” on Friday. W riting on social media platform X , he said: “I call on the Prime Minister not to fall into this trap and not to agree to a shift, even the slightest, from the red lines he set just recently, and they are also very problematic.” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby rebuked Smotrich’s comments, saying “his arguments are dead wrong.” However, Netanyahu’s political future largely depends on his coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal. The Knesset (Israel’s parliament) is currently out of session for its summer recess, which would make it harder – although not impossible – for Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir to collapse the current government. And Israeli sources indicated that Netanyahu may call for elections if a ceasefire deal is reached, which would allow him to control the timing of such elections. Delegations working ‘around the clock’ Mediators are set to convene with Israeli and Hamas negotiating teams in Cairo or Doha this week. But negotiations are already underway with technical delegations working “around the clock” through key details ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Israeli source said. The talks come at an extremely tense time in the Middle East. A pair of high profile assassinations in Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks has sparked fears of retaliation that could lead to a wider conflict. Israel last month killed Fu’ad Shukr, the top military commander of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group. The next day, Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, in what is seen as a major embarrassment for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which was hosting Haniyeh.

Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and, according to Israel, one of the masterminds behind the deadly October 7 terror attack was named the new head of the group’s political bureau following Haniyeh’s assassination. Sinwar has not been seen in public since October 7 and is believed to be hiding in the tunnels trenched beneath Gaza. Haniyeh has played a key role in ceasefire talks but Sinwar’s role has been more limited, given the his difficulties in communicating with the outside world.

Rocket fire toward Israel by Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon has become a near-daily occurrence since the outbreak of war in Gaza, as fears grow over the possibility of an Iranian attack that could escalate into a wider regional conflict. The latest Hezbollah salvo was fired in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza and in retaliation for Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon, the militant group said in a statement. It comes after Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the town of Ma’aroub, southern Lebanon, injured 12 people including six children. About 30 rockets were launched from Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that some fell into open areas and no injuries were reported. Earlier Sunday, the IDF said its instructions to the public had not changed amid a possible military response from Iranian forces to the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. “The IDF and the security establishment monitor our enemies and the developments in the Middle East, with an emphasis on Iran and Hezbollah, and constantly assess the situation,” IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. “IDF forces are deployed and prepared in high readiness. If it becomes necessary to change the instructions, we will update about it in an orderly message on the official channels.” Mediators in ceasefire-hostage talks between Israel and Hamas are making a renewed push to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table this week, as concerns grow that the conflict could spiral into a regional war.

Gaza Civil Defense said people were performing dawn prayers at the Al-Tabi’in compound in the Al-Daraj neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City when it was hit overnight into Saturday. Israel confirmed it carried out the strike, saying it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters. “We recovered at least 90 people who had been killed,” Gaza Civil Defense Spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN, adding that “many of them are torn apart, many are still unidentified.” Videos seen by CNN of the aftermath of the strike show a large number of bodies strewn on the ground. Witnesses said there was no advance warning of the attack. “All of these people who were targeted were civilians, unarmed children, the elderly, men and women,” said Fares Afana, director of ambulance and emergency in northern Gaza. “These were innocent people praying … Where is the entire world?” said one man, who lost his daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren in the strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed to CNN that it hit the compound, saying its air force “precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control center embedded” in the building. The military also said that before the airstrike, “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and intelligence information.” In later statements, the IDF said “at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated” in the strike. They said “precise munitions” were used and disputed the damage being reported by Gaza officials. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari also said that a top Islamic Jihad commander – Ashraf Juda – was likely at the school that was struck, but it’s not clear whether he was hit. CNN is not able to independently verify the statements of either side in relation to the strike. Saturday’s strike is the fifth on a school in Gaza by the Israeli military since last Sunday, according to CNN’s previous reporting. Following the strike, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, said Israel was “genociding the Palestinians one neighborhood at the time, one hospital at the time, one school at the time, one refugee camp at the time, one ‘safe zone’ at the time.” People sift through the rubble inside a Gaza school struck by the IDF on August 10, 2024. Omar al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images Israeli military action in Gaza has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in the enclave – almost its entire population, according to figures from the United Nations. Israel launched the military offensive on October 7, after militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 others abducted in the Hamas-led assault, according to Israeli authorities. On Saturday, Basal said many of the dead were yet to be identified and others transferred to hospital are seriously injured. “There are still large quantities of body parts and torn bodies inside Al-Ahli hospital,” he said. “Families are having a hard time identifying their children.” One woman, known as Um Ahmed, told CNN that she could not find her husband in the aftermath of the strike. “I went to look for my husband and I didn’t see anybody, they were all in pieces,” she said. Um Ahmed told CNN the mosque was full of young people who were “all in pieces and dismembered” in the aftermath of the strike. “The bodies here are not identifiable. … They are all dismembered body parts,” said a man who came to check on the school after hearing of the strike during his morning prayer. Israel told US it used smaller munition to limit civilian harm Qatar and Egypt, who have been leading mediation efforts with the United States, condemned the strike and called it a violation of international law. The three countries have been making a fresh push to bring the warring parties to the negotiation table for a ceasefire and hostage deal. A spokesman for the US National Security Council said the White House was “deeply concerned about reports of civilian casualties” following the strike. “We are in touch with our Israeli counterparts, who have said they targeted senior Hamas officials, and we are asking for further details,” NSC spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. “We know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate out of, but we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimize civilian harm,” he went on. Savett added, “We mourn every Palestinian civilian lost in this conflict, including children, and far too many civilians continue to be killed and wounded. This underscores the urgency of a ceasefire and hostage deal, which we continue to work tirelessly to achieve.” Israeli officials have told their American counterparts they used small munitions – as opposed to larger bombs – during the airstrike in Gaza specifically to mitigate civilian harm, a US official familiar with the matter said. When asked about the strike, an Israeli military official earlier told CNN the Israel Defense Forces had used “three small and precise munitions that cannot cause the damage the Palestinians claim they have caused.” CNN also reported earlier that Israel used at least one US-manufactured precision-guided bomb during the strike, according to weapons experts. Footage of the aftermath filmed by CNN showed parts of an explosive device that Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, confirmed were from a GBU-39 small diameter bomb. According to weapons expert Chris Cobb Smith, the GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition “designed to attack strategically important point targets” while causing low collateral damage.

Qatar’s Foreign Ministry called it “a horrific massacre.” Egypt accused Israel of “deliberately killing civilians,” and said the strike was “clear evidence” that Israel does not have the political will to end the war. European leaders also expressed outrage at the strike. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said he was “appalled” by the strike in a post on X and called for an immediate ceasefire. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he was “horrified” and also called for a truce. The Palestinian Authority condemned the strike and said it also held the US responsible, calling it “part of a pattern of daily atrocities committed by Israeli occupation forces.” Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, said Saturday that “far too many” civilians have been killed. “I mean, Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas. But as I have said many, many times, they also have, I believe, an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties,” Harris said ahead of her rally Saturday evening in Las Vegas, Nevada. Harris added that, “We need to get the hostages out. We need a hostage deal, and we need a ceasefire. And I can’t stress that strongly enough, it needs to get done. The deal needs to get done. It needs to get done now.” Saturday’s attack follows similar lethal strikes by Israel over the past week. Airstrikes on multiple school buildings sheltering displaced Palestinians last weekend killed at least 47, including many children, and injured dozens more. Videos obtained by CNN from the area of last Sunday’s strike – which the IDF also claimed targeted Hamas infrastructure – show extensive destruction and dead bodies in a schoolyard. In the videos, medics and rescuers carry injured children to waiting ambulances. Palestinian officials told CNN that Israel did not give civilians any warning before the airstrikes occurred.

They’re misleading the Israeli public.” In a post Friday, Smotrich called the proposed ceasefire deal a “surrender deal,” writing on social media platform X, “I call on the Prime Minister not to fall into this trap and not to agree to a shift, even the slightest, from the red lines he set just recently, and they are also very problematic.” Smotrich’s comments followed President Joe Biden and the leaders of Qatar and Egypt releasing a joint statement Thursday calling on representatives from Israel and Hamas to resume ceasefire talks on August 15 in Doha or Cairo.

The exchange also comes amid the threat of retaliatory strikes against Israel after a pair of high profile assassinations in Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks.

Even before the joint statement, the US has been lobbying its allies in the region for peace amid fears of an escalating conflict. Biden spoke Monday with King Abdullah of Jordan and with his national security team, who outlined US military assets in the region, where they’ve been deployed in anticipation of a possible attack on Israel from Iran or Hezbollah. Biden also spoke Tuesday with Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke Friday with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi for the second time in a week, according to a State Department readout of their call, about “efforts to calm tensions in the region.” “The Secretary and Foreign Minister Safadi discussed the joint statement by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar which called for an immediate ceasefire to provide relief to both Palestinians in Gaza and the hostages and their families,” according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in the statement.

Sources told CNN it is not unusual for it to take time for money to be released from these packages. But the funding was released this week as Israel and the broader region have been bracing for an attack by Iran and/or Hezbollah following Israel’s assassinations of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and Beirut earlier this month. Israel won’t receive $3.5 billion worth of US-made weapons immediately. Instead, the funding is so Israel can procure systems that are being built now and likely won’t be delivered for several years. The supplemental funding also allocated billions of dollars’ worth of equipment that the Pentagon can draw from its own stockpiles to send directly to Israel on a much faster timeline. US diplomats and the Biden administration have also been pushing peace efforts in the region in recent weeks, amid the looming threat of retaliatory strikes against Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi for the second time in a week, according to a State Department readout of their call Friday, about “efforts to calm tensions in the region.” “The Secretary and Foreign Minister Safadi discussed the joint statement by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar which called for an immediate ceasefire to provide relief to both Palestinians in Gaza and the hostages and their families,” according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in the statement.

But thousands remain unaccompanied,"On Tuesday morning, as Abdallah stood on a dusty street in northern Gaza amid the debris of bombed buildings, he received a call he had waited nine months for.","Aug 9, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Antoinette Radford,Middle East,"CNN — On Tuesday morning, as Abdallah stood on a dusty street in northern Gaza amid the debris of bombed buildings, he received a call he had waited nine months for. “UNICEF phoned me and said they would send them over. Please, please God,” he said wiping the tears from his eyes, in a video shared with CNN by the UN children’s agency, UNICEF. After nine months kept apart by war, his children were on their way to him. “During those nine months, each day lasted nine years,” said Abdallah, whose last name was withheld by UNICEF to protect his identity and those of his family members. Ten days after the war started, Abdallah’s pregnant wife and three children fled to the south of the Gaza Strip seeking safety. But two months ago, his wife, mother-in-law and one of his sons were killed. “I have been eagerly awaiting them. Every day I yearned to hug them, see their mother and their brother. But that was God’s will. Their mother was martyred and so was their brother. I pray God will reunite me with the rest of my children safely,” he said. When Abdallah finally held his youngest son in his arms Tuesday, it was the first time he had ever met him. Over the course of four hours at the end of June, CNN documented what life is like for children in Gaza – from stolen moments of joy, to death that comes far too soon. CNN international correspondent Jomana Karadsheh reports. Clipped From Video video Related video What four hours reveal about life for Gaza’s children “My sweetheart, this is the first time I get to see you,” he said as he kissed his now 6-month-old son, in a moment captured on video by UNICEF. CNN did not speak to Abdallah directly but was provided with his account by the UN agency. Abdallah’s children were returned to his care as a part of a reunification program run by UNICEF in Gaza, which helped seven children from four different families find their parents again on Tuesday alone. The program has been running since March, and its mission is to track down relatives of unaccompanied children who have been orphaned or become lost or separated from their family in the strip, where the burden of Israel’s war against Hamas is weighing particularly heavily on Gaza’s youngest. Of the more than 39,600 people killed by Israel since it launched its invasion into Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, more than 16,000 are children, according to the latest figures released by the Ministry of Health in Gaza on August 7. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers. The ministry does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians. Family members are stepping up to provide care where they can despite repeated displacements. One of the children involved in Tuesday’s UNICEF mission was reunited with his grandmother, who will now take care of him after his mother, father and siblings were killed. But aid workers have told CNN that an increasing number of children – whose parents have either been killed or separated from them – are living with no support. Under-18s make up close to half of the population of the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian census figures. Israel’s repeated evacuation orders and the resultant forced displacement of populations are also causing spikes in reports of child abuse, as families are torn apart and support networks break down, according to Liz Allcock, head of protection at Medical Aid for Palestinians, an aid organization based in the United Kingdom. Displaced children gather to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in the Deir al-Balah governorate in central Gaza on August 8. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images Conflicts and war are known to exacerbate child protection issues, Allcock told CNN. “It’s not unique to Gaza,” she said. What makes Gaza different, however, is the repeated displacement of the population due to intense Israeli bombardment and frequent evacuation orders, she said. “There is largely a surge in reports (of child exploitation) during and following evacuation orders,” Allcock said, adding that this is when children are often becoming separated from their families and exposed to risks. Site visits to displacement camps in Gaza, led by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in June, documented a “significant number” of unaccompanied and separated children. OCHA’s Inter-Cluster Coordination Group – which oversees groups within OCHA working on matters like food security, protection issues and health – coordinated the visits. In one camp, community members raised concerns about an “alarming” increase in child exploitation and abuse, as well as gender-based violence, one assessment published online said. Other sites across the strip have also reported incidents of child labor and “rising concerns ” about child exploitation. It’s not known exactly how many children in Gaza are unaccompanied or separated, according to UNICEF. But using analysis of other global conflicts, the organization estimates that this population stands at around 19,000 children. That number doesn’t consider that Gaza has a high population of children, however. Nor does it consider the large proportion of extended family in Gaza that are stepping up and looking after many children whose parents are killed. UNICEF is unable to verify exact numbers due to a lack of access into Gaza. ‘It’s very common for families to get separated’ Abdallah’s experience of being reunited with his children is not the norm in war-torn Gaza. Child protection agencies face an uphill struggle to reunite unaccompanied and separated children with their families, according to Jessica Dixon, who coordinates child protection efforts in Gaza and West Bank for UNICEF. “Lots of children are being left without parental care,” she told CNN on Wednesday, on the final day of a two-week humanitarian visit to the enclave. “It’s very common for families to get separated. Crossing the checkpoints – from north to south, across Wadi Gaza – lots of people are being taken into detention. That’s been another cause of family separation.” Wadi Gaza is a strip of wetlands bisecting the enclave. Many children have lost their entire families to Israeli air strikes. Just three weeks into the conflict, Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care doctor with Medicines Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, told CNN that doctors in the strip had coined a new term: “WCNSF – wounded child, no surviving family.” Brothers Amjad, aged 2, and Ahmad, aged 7, are shown in Nasser Hospital, southern Gaza, before their medical evacuation to Egypt. CNN Related article Wounded and sick children leave besieged Gaza Strip, in first medical evacuation for weeks Some parents across the strip are also struggling to support their children – both physically and psychologically – given the limited time, space and resources they have to offer, Dr. Yasser Abu-Jamei, a psychiatrist and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, told CNN. Dixon told CNN that as a result of these intense pressures, one key concern that protection agencies have is that of neglect and abandonment of children across the strip. Faced with significant deprivation of resources, many families are barely surviving, often unable to feed themselves, Dixon said. Agencies like UNICEF are working hard to identify and support children at risk of exploitation, particularly unaccompanied and separated children, she said. But there are many operational constraints restricting their efforts and more information is needed about unaccompanied and separated children living in displacement camps, she added. “There is a huge lack of access. There is a lack of security, a lack of communications,” she said. “Phone networks are so difficult, to get hold of different people and for service providers to make contact with different families.” For now, aid organizations are doing what they can to try to reunite children with their families. On UNICEF’s recent reunification trip, the organization created identification bracelets to give to children in case they become separated from their parents – hoping to make Abdallah’s experience one shared by many others in the strip."

The leaders of the United States, Qatar and Egypt said on Thursday they may present what they called a “final bridging proposal” next week, urging Israel and Hamas to conclude a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. The three countries have been leading mediation efforts to strike a deal, and US officials claimed they were getting close before the political leader of Hamas, a principal negotiator on the deal, was killed last week in Iran in a blast widely believed to have been orchestrated by Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. On Thursday night, the mediators stepped up the pressure on Israel and Hamas to resume talks in either Cairo or Doha next week. A source familiar the discussions told CNN that a meeting is being planned for August 15 and is expected to happen, but Israel and Hamas need to confirm their attendance. “The three of us and our teams have worked tirelessly over many months to forge a framework agreement that is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude,” the three heads of state said in the statement.

On Thursday, the three mediators argued that they are “prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues.” The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed Israel will send a delegation to the talks. “Following the proposal of the United States and the mediators, Israel will send on August 15 the negotiating delegation to a place to be determined to summarize the details for the implementation of the framework agreement,” according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. CNN has reached out to Hamas officials for comment. Yahya Sinwar, a senior Hamas official and one of Israel’s most wanted individuals, has been named as the new political leader of the organization, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh, who was based in Qatar. Sinwar, reportedly hiding in a tunnel beneath Gaza, is difficult to reach and is considered a hardliner in his stance towards Israel. Warning Israel and Iran Washington has been warning both Israel and Iran against escalating the violence after 10 months of war in Gaza, in calls with Israel directly and indirect communications through allies to Tehran. “The risk of a major escalation if they do a significant retaliatory attack against Israel is extremely high,” a US official said Iran was told. Escalation would mean “a serious risk of consequences for Iran’s economy and the stability of its newly elected government if it goes down that path,” the official added. The warnings are not meant to imply that the US would carry out its own military strikes against Iran, the official said.

Just days before Haniyeh’s killing, the mediators met with Israel’s head of intelligence, Mossad director David Barnea, in Rome to receive Israel’s latest proposal. Barnea left after just a few hours following a strike attributed to Hezbollah in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights that killed a dozen people. If a meeting happens next week, it would be the first movement on talks that were feared over following Haniyeh’s assassination, and would resurrect hopes that an agreement may be reached.

But could Tehran instead be prepared to pull back in exchange for progress on Gaza peace talks? That was the hope among regional leaders gathered at an emergency summit in Jeddah. It was Wednesday and the world was on edge. Flights across Iran and its neighbors were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel’s war in Gaza. With his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran’s Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri whispered to an aide bending close to catch his words. Cameroon’s foreign minister sat to Bagheri’s right, Yemen’s to his left, along with a room full of other foreign ministers from Muslim-majority countries, all there to help prevent the situation from spiraling into a wider conflict. Since Hamas’s political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, the Islamic Republic’s leaders have vowed vengeance against Israel, whom they claim was responsible. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. Yahya Sinwar was made the political leader of Hamas. Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images/File Related article Hamas names Oct. 7 architect Yahya Sinwar new political leader. What does it mean for ceasefire talks? The unassuming venue for such a last-ditch effort to quell Iran’s seething rage was the headquarters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC), modest by Saudi Arabia’s rapidly modernizing and glitzy standards. It sits in a dusty, nondescript corner of the Red Sea city of Jeddah. The play in the room, if it can be called that, was carefully articulated to CNN by Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, who stepped out of the high stakes talks to promote the initiative his vulnerable kingdom is championing: “The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.” The thrust, to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to soften his stance in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, isn’t new. But the payoff this time may be much more attractive than previous attempts. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US and its allies have communicated directly to both Israel and Iran that  “no one should escalate this conflict,” adding that ceasefire negotiations have entered “a final stage” and could be jeopardized by further escalation elsewhere in the region. Safadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation. Iran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its hasty threats against Israel in the immediate aftermath of Haniyeh’s killing: a Gaza ceasefire that would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians in the Palestinian enclave than it does for taking revenge would fit the bill. But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honor and deterrence are at stake. France’s President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday, retaliation against Israel “has to be abandoned”. Pezeshkian’s response suggests he is listening. “If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire,” he said. Could Hezbollah act alone Nearly ten months since Israel’s war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas brutal October 7 attack which saw around 1200 people in Israel killed and at least 250 others taken hostage, almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian health officials - and there is still no end in sight to the conflict The catch in the Gaza ceasefire escalation off-ramp play is that it is heavy on hope and short on substance. For it to work, Netanyahu will have to buy in to it too. Hamas just made this harder by replacing Haniyah with his tougher counterpart inside Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, an architect of the October 7 attacks, and anyway, right now they are in no mood for meaningful talks. The change, if it’s going to come, according to the consensus at the OIC  has to be from the outside, from the only person who remotely has the clout to temper Netanyahu – US President Joe Biden. Iranians attend the memorial procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024. Majid Asgaripour/Reuters But almost a year into the conflict, Biden refuses a showdown with Israel’s most hardline, right-wing government in its history, that also adding to the frustrations in Jeddah. Riyad Mansour, Palestine’s Permanent Observer at the UN, was in the room with Bagheri and the others. “The region does not need escalation,” he said  “What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran” What Bagheri did get in Jeddah was the kind of diplomatic support intended help get them off the ledge, with Mansour saying “With regard to what Iran wanted about, you know, the respecting its territorial integrity and its sovereignty, there was, you know, a strong support to this sentiment.” ISRAEL - AUGUST 05: An airstrike is being carried out by the Israeli army in the area in southern Lebanon, seen from Israel, on August 5, 2024.

One US official and one western intelligence official told CNN that fears are higher now about Hezbollah taking action than Iran, raising the prospect that the Lebanon-based militia group may act without them. For Netanyahu this may look like semantics intended to blunt Israel’s desire for an overwhelming response against either aggressor. He views Iran and Hezbollah as different hands of the same theological head. With the exception of direct IranianIsraeli exchange of fire in April, Hezbollah has always landed the punches on Israel Iran hesitates to take, and may this time throw a double blow, one for Shukr and one for Hamas’s Haniyeh. Were that the case Israel’s retaliation against Hezbollah could just as quickly become the regional escalation dragging in Iran that everyone fears. What is clear, the Jeddah meet and the back channel diplomacy buys diplomatic space and time to develop an off ramp that has a least a little traction for now. Both Iran and the US, to a degree, are buying in to it. Whether this fizzles out to another false horizon is with Bagheri and his president."

The coastal city of 77,000 residents sits just 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border with Lebanon, where the Israeli army and Hezbollah fighters have been exchanging fire for nearly 10 months . Unlike many other communities at the Israel-Lebanon border that have become ghost towns since October, Nahariya stands out as one of the cities that has not been depopulated as it doesn’t fall within the evacuation zone. Almost 62,000 residents of border communities have been displaced since Hezbollah and Israel started exchanging fire in October after Israel launched its war in Gaza. Forty-three Israelis have been killed and another 250 injured, according to the Israeli prime minister’s Office. Across the border in Lebanon, at least 400 people have been killed since October 8 and more than 94,000 have been displaced , according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Though life continues in Nahariya, streets are less busy than usual, locals told CNN. While pedestrians and motorists are present, the atmosphere contrasts sharply with Tel Aviv 80 miles down the coast, where bars, beaches and restaurants remain bustling. Tommy Lowenstein, 67, said the situation is “tense” in the north. “We feel it. We see it in the streets, we see less people.” Nahariya has declared a state of emergency, according to an official at the city’s municipality. Residents can hear everything from outgoing artillery fire over the border to rockets that land nearby on a daily basis, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media. The sound of rockets that fall in nearby towns and kibbutzim (agricultural communes) are regularly heard in Nahariya.

While the city’s residents have been accustomed to cross-border attacks, the conflict has escalated in recent days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr on July 30. The next day, former Palestinian prime minister and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran in an attack Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied involvement. Israel has been anticipating a retaliatory attack from Iran and its regional proxies. But two sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN on Wednesday that it looks increasingly likely that Hezbollah may strike Israel independently of Iran. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Tuesday that the group will attack Israel but is keeping the country waiting as “part of the punishment.” Feels like war is ‘getting closer to us’ Liz Levy, 40, lives in Nahariya with her three children and says the war is taking a mental toll on her family. “Two days ago, I had a panic attack,” she told CNN. “Every three days, there’s a siren. It’s very scary.” Levy said she worries about bringing up her children in a climate of war, adding that her children cry whenever they hear blaring sirens warning of incoming rockets. “My daughter, she is 7 years old, and she also had a panic attack,” she said.

They (Hezbollah) are pointing at us,” Shira Jorno, 23, told CNN. “We feel it getting closer to us.” The Nahariya municipality has added more than 40 new shelters in the city since the war began and has conducted multiple training sessions to prepare medics and emergency workers for an attack, the municipal official said. Asked whether the city will have to evacuate if the conflict escalates, the official said there is nowhere to move such a large population. “Nahariya has not been evacuated as a decision that was taken together with the army because there is nowhere to go,” the official told CNN, adding that as the conflict zone expands in the north, it is difficult to keep moving people south. “Now they (Hezbollah) say Haifa (will be attacked), after Haifa it will be Tel Aviv.

Unfortunately, I received a lot of bad messages online, one said ‘Prepare for your death!’” Following the carnage of the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were murdered, security has always been tight around the team. Tensions have been heightened further by Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks and Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza . But as unsettling as the messages were, Reuveny says that he used them as fuel for his fire. “I actually think that it gave me strength,” he explained. “I didn’t read all of them, but I read some of them and it did give me some motivation. I just wanted to prove to the haters that Israel is a strong country, and those messages are not going to bring me down.” Up until this summer’s Olympics, Israel had only seen three of their athletes crowned as Olympic champions, but one of them was Reuveny’s windsurfing coach Gal Fridman – who became his nation’s first gold medalist in 2004 in Athens. Reuveny was only four years old at the time, but as he grew up, he became aware of the legend. “Windsurfing has been a really big sport in Israel because of him,” the now-24-year-old explained. “And right now, 20 years later, when we walk in the airport or in the street, people recognize him and ask for pictures. It just shows how big of an idol he is to all the people in Israel.” Reuveny celebrates after placing second in the semifinals of the men's IQFoil windsurfing event. Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images Reuveny wasn’t expected to medal in the Olympics this summer, but he says that he always believed in his own ability and Fridman’s advice might just have made all the difference. “My coach told me that a lot of people are going to lose it under pressure,” he said. “He just kept telling me to stay calm.” Reuveny’s teammate Sharon Kantor won silver in the women’s windsurfing and, with a total of six medals of the time of writing, this has been Israel’s most successful Olympics ever. Days after climbing to the top of the podium in Marseille, Reuveny is now pinching himself in the Olympic Village in Paris. “I’ve been looking up to gold medalist athletes all my life and dreaming about being like them,” he said. “No one thought I could actually win gold. It kind of sounds surreal when you call me an Olympic gold medalist, every few hours I check the medal to see if it’s real; I still have the medal and it’s not a dream. I think I made a pretty big impact to Israelis and the Jewish community all around the world.” But Reuveny’s success is a droplet of joy amid the nightmare of Israel’s war in Gaza and the rising concerns of an even bigger regional conflagration. He says that some of his classmates and friends have been killed in the last year, some at the Nova music festival in the October 7 Hamas attacks and others who are Israeli soldiers. Ahead of the interview with CNN, Reuveny asked not to discuss his brother, but he had previously told Reuters that “he’s been a combat soldier since the war began.” “It’s really sad and it’s a hard time for a lot of people in Israel and I’m not the only one who’s been affected,” Reuveny told CNN. More than once, he expressed hopes that the fighting will soon stop. On the eve of the Games, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach described all the athletes at the Games as “peace ambassadors,” and the eight Palestinians in Paris have reportedly been warmly received.

The statement comes after Israeli media obtained leaked surveillance video that allegedly showed Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman base in Israel’s Negev desert. The footage, broadcast by Israeli channel N12, appears to show a group of detainees lying on the ground at the controversial desert detention facility . A group of soldiers can be seen taking a detainee to a corner of the facility. Several Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers, who were working as guards at the base, are under investigation for the alleged “suspected substantial abuse” of a Palestinian prisoner. The IDF said last month that its Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) was formally looking into the allegations. According to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), the alleged victim – a man in his thirties – was brought to one of Israel’s public hospitals in life-threatening condition. He had injuries to his upper body and his rectum, the group told CNN. PHRI said it had raised concern about similar allegations at the base in the past, but that this incident came to light and prompted an investigation because the alleged victim was taken to a public hospital away from the detention center.

Jill Gralow/Reuters Related article Far-right lawmakers break into Israeli detention camp, protesting probe into soldiers’ alleged abuse of prisoner “When there are alleged violations, the government of Israel needs to take steps to investigate those who are alleged to have committed abuses and, if appropriate, hold them accountable,” said Miller, who called the IDF announcement of arrests of those alleged to have involved and an investigation “appropriate.” The IDF said it had no comment on either the leaked video or the State Department’s comment. A report released by the UN Human Rights Office last week said Palestinian detainees from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have faced torture, mistreatment and sexual abuse since October 7 and that least 53 have died in detention. On Wednesday, Israeli lawmakers denounced the video leak. Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for an “immediate criminal investigation” to find out who leaked the video, which he described as having “hugely damaged Israel internationally.” Widespread allegations of abuse In a CNN investigation released in May, Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described widespread abuse at Sde Teiman. The abuse included blindfolding, extreme physical restraint, and prolonged handcuffing, leading to severe injuries. The whistleblowers said that Palestinian detainees at the base were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners’ limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said. The account tallied with details of a letter authored by a doctor working at Sde Teiman published by Ha’aretz in April . Several Israeli and Palestinian rights groups, as well as local and international media outlets, also detailed alleged torture and mistreatment at the camp. Patrick Gallagher/CNN Related article Strapped down, blindfolded, held in diapers: Israeli whistleblowers detail abuse of Palestinians in shadowy detention center Responding to CNN’s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 investigation, the Israeli military said in a statement: “The IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.” “Detainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.” The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk. Earlier in July, following an international outcry over reports of abuse at the Sde Teiman detention facility, Netanyahu told Israel’s Supreme Court that he had ordered an end to long-term imprisonment at the detention center, limiting its use to initial interrogations and a temporary holding facility. The vast majority of prisoners had already been transferred out of the desert facility , according to the Israeli government’s statement to the court at the time.

The Lebanon-based militant group is moving faster than Iran in its planning and is looking to strike Israel in the coming days, one of the sources said. Iran, meanwhile, appears to still be working out how it plans to respond, multiple officials have told CNN. One US military official told CNN that Iran had made some, but not all, of the preparations that the US would expect to see in advance of a major attack on Israel. But given Lebanon’s proximity to Israel as its direct neighbor to the north, Hezbollah could act with little to no notice, the second source familiar with the intelligence said — which is not true of Iran. It is not clear how or if Iran and Hezbollah, the nation’s most powerful proxy, are coordinating on a possible attack right now, the person added, and there is a sense among some officials that the two may not be entirely aligned on how to move forward. Looming attacks would come in response to Israel last week killing the top military commander for Hezbollah, Fu’ad Shukr, in Lebanon. The next day, Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas’ political leader in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in that incident. In the days since, countries around the world are closely watching the region. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation convened an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday at the level of foreign ministers to address ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The meeting, held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, resulted in a draft final communiqué “condemning Israel’s actions” and reaffirming solidarity with the Palestinian cause. A significant highlight of the communiqué was the condemnation of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas leader and former Palestinian Prime Minister, in Tehran. The OIC held Israel responsible for this act, calling it a “heinous crime and a violation of international law and the UN Charter.” The organization warned that such actions by Israel “undermine” regional security and stability. This week, President Joe Biden and his top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have held a flurry of calls with counterparts across the Middle East. They have each had numerous exchanges with the leaders and foreign ministers of Jordan, Qatar and Egypt with a message of de-escalation.

The Palestinian militant group appointed Yahya Sinwar to lead its political bureau on Tuesday, replacing Ismail Haniyeh , who was killed in Tehran in an attack Iran blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. The move consolidates power within the organization under Sinwar, who until this week was the head of Hamas in Gaza. Sinwar, a hardened militant with many years spent in an Israeli prison, is viewed as less compromising in dealings with Israel and closer to Iran than his predecessor. He is accused by Israel of being the mastermind of the October 7 attack and believed to be hiding in a tunnel in Gaza. “I’m surprised about this move,” said Hatem Mohammed, 47, a Gaza-based retired civil servant for the Palestinian Authority that is run by Fatah, a rival party to Hamas. “It’s a hasty, irrational and reactionary move in response to Haniyeh’s assassination. They (Hamas) know internally that he’s not fit for the job. He’s an emotive and hasty person.” Yahya Sinwar attends a parade in Gaza City on May 30, 2021. Ashraf Amra/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Related article Who is Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader Israel has called a ‘dead man walking’ The situation in Gaza, he told CNN, needs a leader who “knows politics,” like “Haniyeh, (former political leader Khaled) Meshaal or (senior Hamas member) Mousa Abu Marzook.” “This appointment sends a message that the war will continue. I don’t know what they were thinking,” said Mohammed, who said he lost five members of his family in the war and suffers from infection brought about by food poisoning. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people in the enclave, according to the Palestinian authorities. Sinwar, meanwhile, is believed by US officials to be deep underground, possibly surrounded by Israeli hostages as human shields. Sinwar’s appointment has cast uncertainty on the fate ceasefire talks with Israel that would also see Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners released. He is hard to reach, is considered more hardline than Haniyeh, and is seen as being less vulnerable to pressure from Arab nations than Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar. ‘The death is all the same’ “We don’t care who they name (as leader). The names are plenty, but the death is all the same. All they’ve brought us is destruction,” said Ismail Jalal, a father of two in northern Gaza who says he struggles to find food for his sick children. “All we’re asking for is a ceasefire. Someone who will be able to reach a deal and save what is left of our people and the children that are dying daily… someone who can practice self-restraint, with no empty slogans.” Abu Fadi Rafeeq from Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, and displaced in Khan Younis, said the decision to appoint Sinwar was “reckless.” The new leader is “stubborn” and “will let the entire population die just so he can keep his word.” “He doesn’t suffer like me. He doesn’t go hungry like me. He hasn’t lost his entire family like me,” he told CNN, adding that he has lost 38 members of his family, including both his parents, his two sisters and their children, and two of his brothers’ wives.

Israel launched the war in retaliation to Hamas-led militants’ October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and more than 250 abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Despite some Gazans being disgruntled with Hamas’ choice of political leader, there are indications that support for the organization remains significant in the enclave. Polling in Gaza faces multiple challenges, including population displacement, people’s reluctance to criticize Hamas publicly and the risks to personal safety in war time. But one survey conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research between May 26 and June 1 in the West Bank and Gaza showed that only 8% of Gazans blame Hamas for their suffering , with two-thirds blaming Israel. Of Gazan respondents, 46% supported Hamas returning to power in the enclave after the war. Satisfaction with Hamas’ performance stood at 64% and Sinwar’s at 50%. “He’s the best choice to lead the next phase,” said Abu Ali, an injured Gazan who said he was a Hamas fighter. “He’s the only one who has lived this ordeal.” CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati contributed to this report."

What does it mean for ceasefire talks?,Israel has accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7. He is believed to be a key target in the siege of Gaza.,"Aug 7, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Kareem Khadder,Middle East,"CNN — Hamas has named Yahya Sinwar – its leader in Gaza and one of the planners of the October 7 terror attack on Israel – as the new head of its political bureau , following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh last week. Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ attack – though experts say he is likely one of several – making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza. He has remained at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, US officials believe. Sinwar has not been seen in public since October 7. The move consolidates Hamas under Sinwar, one of the group’s most powerful figures. Sinwar is seen as a hardliner and his appointment casts further uncertainty over truce talks already rattled by Haniyeh’s assassination. In a statement Tuesday, the group announced “the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as head of the movement’s political bureau, succeeding the martyred leader Ismail Haniyeh, may God have mercy on him.” Sinwar’s predecessor Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, raising fears that Israel’s conflict with Hamas and its allies could develop into a multi-front, fully-fledged war in the Middle East. While the Iranian government and Hamas say that Israel carried out the assassination, Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. In response to Sinwar’s selection, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told the Saudi network Al Arabiya, “There’s only one place we are designating for Yahya Sinwar, and that’s right next to Mohammed Deif and all the other terrorists who are responsible for October 7 [attacks]. It’s the only place we are preparing and designating for him.” Israel said last week that Hamas’ military chief Deif, was killed in a strike it carried out in southern Gaza last month – a report Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied. Two of Hamas’ principal allies – Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – have welcomed Sinwar’s new role.  Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, said the choice of Sinwar “confirms that the objectives sought by the enemy through the assassinations of leaders and officials have failed to achieve their goals.” ‘Not good news regarding the deal’ The move raised immediate questions on the next steps for ceasefire and hostage negotiations with Israel. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, told CNN late Tuesday that the selection of Sinwar to replace Haniyeh means, “you [Israel] chose to assassinate those who negotiate, and we chose those who can oblige you to sign the agreement,” he said. And one man who spent many years in Israeli prisons with Sinwar, Esmat Mansour, told CNN that his new role spells trouble for any future deal. “As far as Israel is concerned, this is not good news regarding the deal, because it has considered the military wing and Sinwar to be the hardliners,” he said. “It’s Sinwar who holds the captives. Now all decisions are within his authority, the military as well as the political decisions, and the decision [whether to hold] negotiations.” He added that Sinwar’s close relationship with Iran could mean other negotiating parties, like Qatar and Turkey, which have good relations with the United States, “lose their ability to influence the deal, or at least weaken their ability to influence.” Ismael Haniyeh, Palestinian leader of the militant group Hamas, arrives to participate in the swearing in ceremony for the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, at the parliament in Tehran on July 30, 2024.

He was elected to Hamas ’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo’s de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). He has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and was sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France. CNN video Related video See how data analyses contradicts Netanyahu’s claim about war in Gaza Mansour told CNN that “Sinwar is a unifying name, there is consensus on that name internally for Hamas…They need a unified movement. Symbolically and politically Sinwar unifies the movement.” Mansour said that other candidates who might have been in the frame would have run into opposition from Hamas’ international allies. “Sinwar has returned the decision-making to Gaza, and in this way they get rid of pressure from the host countries.” At the same time “because he’s on the run, it means that the leadership will be collective,” meaning that other Hamas figures would have leading roles, Mansour said. Some analysts say that Sinwar’s elevation now blurs or even extinguishes the distinction between Hamas’ political and military wings. Devorah Margolin of the Washington Institute, who studies Hamas, posted on X that: “Prior to Oct 7, Hamas long tried to differentiate between its political and military wings. Today’s decision to announce Yahya Sinwar – [who] masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks – as the new politburo chief ends all misconceptions surrounding the group’s structure.” Abu Hein said that Sinwar’s appointment as Hamas’ political leader “signifies, firstly, that the Palestinian cause is in a very dangerous stage, especially with the ongoing war on Gaza. Secondly, it shows that Hamas is a crucial player in the Palestinian arena on the international level.” This story has been updated with additional information."

It’s his (Hamas’) money, it’s his fuel, it’s his civilian control of the Gaza Strip. It just doesn’t work,” he said. Israel has control over aid that enters Gaza and aid groups are in charge of distributing it. While there have been some anecdotal reports from Gazans of Hamas stealing aid, it’s unclear how rampant it is. US Special Envoy David Satterfield said in February that no Israeli official had presented him or the Biden administration with “ specific evidence of diversion or theft of assistance.” Israel is facing mounting criticism from aid groups and international organizations for restricting food aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. A United Nations statement, citing independent experts, indicated last month that famine has spread across the entire enclave. The experts accused Israel of conducting an “intentional and targeted starvation campaign,” which they termed a “form of genocidal violence.” exp Catriona Murdoch gaza man-made famine intv 011203ASEG2 cnni world_00002001.png video Related video How experts believe starvation is being applied in Gaza The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of “starvation as a weapon of war,” among other allegations. Netanyahu has strongly denied the allegations, saying they are based on a “ pack of lies .” He has said that if Palestinians in Gaza aren’t getting enough food, “it’s not because Israel is blocking it, it’s because Hamas is stealing it .” Israel has stated that it will not end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. The conflict began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has resulted in the deaths of more than 39,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. Smotrich on Monday advocated for Israeli control of the aid effort “as a part or as an essential means of realizing the defined goals of the war,” and said only minimal aid is needed in Gaza in the months and years to come. “No one talks about (Israeli) military rule (of Gaza) now. No need to unclog sewers, no need for education, no need for welfare. Gaza in the next two years is (going to be) a war zone. You need food, some medicine and a minimum of sanitation – water, sewage.

UNRWA has 14,000 staff members in Gaza. The investigation was launched in January after Israel accused some UNRWA employees of participating in the attack that left 1,200 people in Israel dead. UN investigators were not able to speak with the accused, though some accused responded to written questions. Christiane Amanpour speaks to former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who led an independent review of the neutrality of the UN relief agency in Gaza. Clipped From Video video Related video Head of an independent review into UNRWA shares her findings Some on the nine were fired in January, when Israel made its allegations. Others were fired after new assertions were made this spring, Juliette Touma, communications director for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), told CNN. The UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigated a total of 19 employees who were accused by Israel of participation in the attack. “The evidence obtained by OIOS indicated that the UNRWA staff members may have been involved in the armed attacks of 7 October 2023,” OIOS said in a statement. In nine other cases, OIOS said that the evidence was “insufficient” for the employees to be fired, but that “appropriate measures will be taken in due course.” In the final case, “no evidence was obtained by OIOS to support the allegations of the staff member’s involvement.” In a statement on X , a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Nadav Shoshani, said: “9 of your employees might have participated in the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.” “Your ‘relief’ agency has officially stooped to a new level of low, and it is time that the world sees your true face.” UNRWA was founded by the UN a year after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, which marked the creation of Israel and the displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homes in an event known by Palestinians as the Nakba (catastrophe). The agency provides a wide range of aid and services to Palestinian refugees and their descendants. It is a major source of employment for the refugees, who make up most of its more than 30,000 employees across the Middle East, and has representative offices in New York, Geneva and Brussels. In a statement on Monday, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said that his agency’s “priority is to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine Refugees in Gaza and across the region, especially in the face of the ongoing war, the instability and risk of regional escalation.” “UNRWA is committed to continue upholding the fundamental principles and values of the United Nations, including the humanitarian principle of neutrality, and to ensuring that all its staff abide by the Agency’s policy on outside and political activities.” Cut off from vital funding The Israeli government in January accused some UNRWA staff members of involvement in the October 7 attacks. The Israeli government did not make their evidence public, nor – according to UNRWA – did they share it with UNRWA. Nonetheless, UNWRA in January said that it had terminated the accused employees’ contracts. The head of the IDF’s Israel Defense Forces’ Military Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, met with senior US officials in January to share his country’s intelligence on the accused. “We gave them specific names and which organizations they are affiliated with, whether Hamas or PIJ or others, and what exactly they did on October 7th. We showed them that we had solid intelligence from difference sources,” an Israeli official told CNN at the time. Following an Israeli strike inside Rafah that took the lives of at least 45 Palestinians on Sunday, Isa Soares speaks with Sam Rose, Director of Planning for UNRWA, about what he calls a ""massacre of civilians"" and the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the ground. Clipped From Video video Related video UNRWA on Rafah strike: ‘Gaza has become hell on Earth’ Israel in February released some details about 12 employees whom it accused, including their names, photos and alleged roles with Hamas. The additional details also included screengrabs of what Israel said were two UNWRA employees – a social worker and math teacher – in Israel on October 7. The defense ministry also provided ID photos of 10 other alleged Hamas members, their positions and alleged involvement in the deadly incursion, but did not provide any supporting evidence to back up their claims. CNN could not independently verify the identity of the men or Israel’s allegations about their involvement with Hamas. The allegations led to several UNRWA’s most important donor countries to withdraw funding from the agency. Most of those countries have reinstated their funding. The United States – historically, UNRWA’s largest donor – has not. Israel accused further employees of involvement in March and April. OIOS investigators met with Israeli officials as part of their investigation and review their intelligence. They also reviewed UNRWA employees’ communications and media reports. “Because of safety concerns,” they did not meet with the accused UNRWA staff or corroborating witnesses. “In some cases, however, OIOS was able to request and secure videorecorded statements from the subjects who responded to a series of set questions addressing the allegations of their involvement in the armed attacks of 7 October 2023,” the UN said in a statement."

Multiple US officials across the region and in Washington told CNN that the US expects Iran to retaliate in the coming days – perhaps even within the next 24 hours – against Israel for Ismail Haniyeh’s killing . But the US has struggled to gauge when the response will come and what form it will take, in part because Iran already moved some of the military assets necessary to carry out a major attack on Israel in April, making it more difficult for US intelligence to predict its actions now, according to two US officials. Officials are relying on multiple streams of intelligence, and there are divisions among national security officials on how and when Iran’s response might unfold. The relative uncertainty has left the Biden administration in a defensive crouch as it tries to rally allies and pressure Iran not to escalate tensions. The killing of Haniyeh – who served as a top Hamas political figure whose job included a role as one of the group’s chief hostage and ceasefire negotiators – along with the killing of Hezbollah leader Fu’ad Shukr in Lebanon last week have thrown the war into its most uncertain phase . While the bulk of the war has been fought between Israel and Iran’s proxies – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – Haniyeh’s assassination on Iranian soil and Iran’s vows of retaliation threaten to throw the conflict into a regional war that could draw in the United States. People await their flights at the Beirut International Airport departure hall on August 5, 2024. Urgent calls grew for foreign nationals to leave Lebanon, which would be on the front line of a regional war, as Iran and its allies readied their response to high-profile killings blamed on Israel.

The extent of the United States’ further involvement in the war largely depends on how exactly Iran responds to Haniyeh’s death. In preparation for possible Iranian retaliation, two US destroyers moved from the Gulf of Oman to the Red Sea in recent days, according to a US official – putting both ships closer to Israel. The destroyers, the USS Laboon and the USS Cole, are part of a number of assets US Central Command has placed strategically across the region amid fears that Iran could soon launch a major attack on Israel for the second time this year. US destroyers helped shoot down ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran at Israel in April. Biden spoke with the Jordanian king Monday morning, where both leaders discussed efforts to “de-escalate regional tensions,” according to a White House readout. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also met with the administration’s national security team later Monday afternoon in the White House Situation Room, where they “focused on the threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and to U.S. servicemembers,” according to a readout of the meeting. The Jordanian king emphasized the need for de-escalation in the region while also warning of extremist settler violence against Palestinians. The US has been asking countries that have diplomatic relations withIran to urge the country not to escalate the conflict, a State Department spokesman said Monday. “We have been sending consistent messages through our diplomatic engagements encouraging people to communicate to the government of Iran that escalation is not in their interest and that we will defend Israel from attacks, and that escalation does not serve Iran’s interest, just as it doesn’t serve the interests of anyone in the region,” the spokesman, Matthew Miller, said. Miller declined to give a timeframe of when the US expects Iran to retaliate. But he added: “We don’t think this attack should happen, and we are working to try to prevent it from happening.” In April, Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles toward Israel in retaliation for the killing of some of its officials at what it considered a diplomatic compound in Syria, the first time Iran had taken direct action against Israel in decades. But that time, officials said, Tehran telegraphed its intent, and the US was able to see the movement of weapons systems and other equipment into place — a key marker that US intelligence officials often use to judge when and what kind of military action an adversary is planning. That intelligence was part of how US Central Command was able to form a defensive alliance and coordinate a strategy that ultimately led to the successful shoot-down of almost all of the projectiles Iran fired that night. This time, according to officials who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, the American intelligence picture is much murkier. The Biden administration is racing the clock to try to keep the situation from spiraling into all-out war — even as officials have privately expressed skepticism that it will be possible to constrain Iran.

Sign up here. Beirut, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem CNN — Middle Eastern nations are bracing for the potential widening of the Israel-Hamas war amid threats by Iran to avenge the killing of Hamas’ political leader in Tehran last week. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of the head of Hamas’ political bureau Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. The country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has warned that “blood vengeance” for the killing is “certain.” Both Tehran and Hamas blame Israel for the killing but Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied involvement. Hundreds of Lebanese prepared to flee the country as nations called on their citizens to leave Lebanon. The US embassy in Beirut on Saturday encouraged citizens who wish to depart “to book any ticket” as several airlines suspended or canceled flights to the country. In Israel, the government evaluated its preparedness and options should Iran and its regional proxies attack, while citizens stocked up on supplies in anticipation of an Iranian assault. This week’s events could determine the course of the war in Gaza and significantly shift the focus away from the besieged enclave if retaliation by Iran escalates into a wider regional conflict involving the United States and other nations. Such escalation could also jeopardize efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and release hostages, despite recent progress in negotiations. CNN video Related video Ret. US general predicts how Iran could escalate attacks against Israel Iran and Israel exchanged direct fire for the first time in April after a decades-long shadow war during which the two sides avoided striking each other’s territory. Iran launched 300 projectiles at Israel on April 13, accusing it of attacking its diplomatic building in Syria earlier that month. Israel responded with a limited strike on Iran . While the unprecedented exchange was contained at the time, another round of fighting may be harder to keep from escalating. The US has boosted its preparedness to defend Israel in case of another Iranian attack. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed comprehensive security strategies to protect Israel, according to a statement on Monday. The discussions included detailed scenarios outlining both defensive and offensive capabilities. And Michael Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, is in the Middle East, according to a US defense official, who would not say what country Kurilla was in or whatever other countries he would be visiting. In a last-ditch effort at diplomacy, regional countries have reached out to Iran to try to calm tensions. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi flew to Tehran on Sunday, a rare trip for a top official from the US-allied monarchy. Separately, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatti called Iran’s Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani to discuss the “unprecedented and very dangerous” regional escalation, according to the Egyptian foreign ministry. ‘A major mistake’ But Iranian officials are not relenting. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told Safadi that Haniyeh’s assassination was a “major mistake by the Zionist regime (Israel) that will not go unanswered,” according to Iranian state TV. In a weekly news conference in Tehran, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday that the country is determined to deter Israel and that “no one should doubt” its resolve in doing so. Israel could also face an attack from its northern front. Israel assassinated Fu’ad Shukr, a high-ranking Hezbollah commander, last week in response to the killing of 12 children with a rocket on the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Shukr’s killing “crossed red lines” and will be met with an “inevitable” response, hinting at coordination with other regional groups. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran “and its minions” on Sunday that his country was determined to “stand against them on every front and in every arena –  far and near.” “Anyone who harms us will pay a very heavy price,” Netanyahu said during a speech in Jerusalem. He reiterated his assertion that increasing military pressure on Hamas was the only way to achieve the goals of the war in Gaza and bring the hostages home. Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri (L) meets with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi (R) in Tehran on Sunday. AFP/Getty Images Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for failure to reach a deal. Anti-government rallies took place in several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding a deal to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza despite regional security threats. Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu said he instructed an Israeli delegation to leave for Cairo on Saturday to continue negotiations for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. He said Israel had an “ironclad commitment” to return all hostages, adding that he’s “ready to go a long way” to win the release of all hostages while maintaining Israel’s security. Israel was considering its options to prepare for a regional attack over the weekend. The government “is reviewing possible actions that would exact a price in the case of attempts by Iran and its proxies to attack Israel,” the Israeli defense ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Gallant said Israel was “prepared very strongly in defense - on land and in the air and we are ready to move quickly to attack or to react,” insisting on the importance of readiness for a quick transition from defense to attack. On Thursday, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that while the country had “very good defense systems” and international partners who have reinforced their deployment in the region, Israel’s defenses were “not hermetically sealed.” Business as usual in Beirut Meanwhile, residents of both Israel and Lebanon are preparing for a wider conflict. Major airlines suspended flights to both countries, leaving some Israeli travelers stranded abroad, and residents of Lebanon scrambled to get on flights out of the country. The US embassy in Beirut said that some commercial options out of the country remained available despite several airlines suspending or canceling flights, and other flights selling out. In the summer months, Lebanon is usually packed with visitors from abroad, mainly from the Lebanese diaspora, giving the country a much-needed economic boost. Many such travelers are considering cutting their vacations short and taking the first flight back home. But even as the specter of war looms over the country, many are operating normally. Along Beirut’s seafront on Sunday, Arabic pop music blared through speakers as groups of men, beers in hand, sunbathed. Behind them, younger men practiced their diving skills in the Mediterranean Sea as children in floaties swam in the rocky sea. Samer Othman, 51, said he doesn’t think the region is on the brink of an expanded war. “If we were to have war, it would have happened 10 months ago,” he said, referring to October, when Hezbollah launched cross border attacks on Israel after Israel launched a devastating assault on Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7 attack during which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. This picture taken from northern Israel near the border with Lebanon shows smoke billowing during Israeli bombardment above the Lebanese Wazzani area on Monday. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Walking shirtless on the corniche with his elderly father, Othman said a lifetime under multiple wars had strengthened him and his countrymen. “The country is used to problems and shocks. We can’t live in fear. Fear can only prevent you from living but it won’t prevent death.” Others, however, were more jittery about the situation. A family was posing for pictures by the rooftop pool of a luxury Beirut hotel when two sonic booms sent them running for cover. They returned to the pool without the children when it turned out there was no airstrike. Israeli jets violating Lebanese airspace often break the sound barrier. The country braces for war in its own way and tends to pick up after itself. Hours after Hezbollah supporters held a funeral procession for Shukr, the Hezbollah commander, Beirut’s skyline was lit with colorful fireworks coinciding with a concert on the other side of town. On Sunday, thousands marched to Beirut port to mark four years since an explosion ripped through the city, killing more than 200 people. To this day, no one has been brought to justice. And with the prospect of war on the horizon, many say they don’t have confidence in their leaders or a choice in what comes next. “This is not a leadership. It’s an existence-ship (sic). This is a situation that we have to live with unfortunately,” Liz Nicholas, 31, said, lowering the placard she’s holding at the march. “They don’t represent me. I don’t think of them as my government or my leadership. They just exist. And for some reason we have to be ok with it or live outside the country like most of us are doing.” Israelis stock up on essentials In Israel, supermarkets reported a spike in shopping for basic goods on Friday. The Victory supermarket chain told CNN that sales of some goods were up 30% compared to regular sales, adding that people bought canned food, cereals, pasta, toilet paper, frozen meat, bottled water and hygiene wipes. The Jerusalem municipality last week issued instructions on what to do in the event that the city comes under attack, distributing a file with a list of parking lots that will be used as shelters, and a list of bomb shelters. It said residents must be able to reach bomb shelters in 90 seconds. “Residents are advised to clean and prepare their bomb shelters in advance,” the file said. Residents were advised to stock enough water and food for three days and to buy batteries and flashlights in addition to medications. Several Israeli agencies and services have stepped up readiness. The emergency services Magen David Adom (MDA) said it was prepared for every scenario after a three-day exercise “aimed at preparing for a potential war in the north and blackout scenarios. The exercise involved handling casualty events and “teams practiced a ‘blackout scenario’ with a focus on using satellite communication tools.” Despite the preparations, many Israelis are continuing with their daily business. In Tel Aviv’s Dizengoff Circus square, Rony Be’er, 75, walked with his friend, Ivana Reiser, 73, on Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the state memorial for Zeev Jabotinsky, Zionist leader and founder of the Israeli right-wing ideology, at Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem, on Sunday. Naama Grynbaum/Pool/AFP/Getty Images “They could hit us any minute now,” Be’er said. Asked what they are doing to prepare for a potential attack, he said: “We don’t do anything. We just walk.” Baer and Reiser say that, like many Israelis, they have ready-made shelters at home used  in other conflicts. Many of Israeli apartment buildings have built-in “safe rooms,” reinforced with concrete as thick as two feet, as well as heavy steel doors. All Israeli buildings erected after 1993 are required to have bomb shelters . Cinemas, libraries and malls are also equipped with bomb shelters. Some remain closed but open automatically when sirens go off. Theater students Roy Dror, 23, and Ron Heckmann, 26, say they’re not doing much to prepare for an attack, but know exactly where the shelters are should the sirens sound. Dror was meant to take a flight to London on Tuesday, but it was cancelled. “So we’re a bit terrified I guess,” he told CNN. “We’re very scared in a way, but life in Tel Aviv and in Israel (is) quite regular.” Heckmann, who grew up in the northern Israeli town of Nahariyah on the border with Lebanon, said he and his family “used to suffer a lot of bombs.” Compared to the north, he said, Tel Aviv feels safe. At MDA, Israel’s main emergency services organization, staff are on high alert. The decades-old establishment has expanded its ambulance fleet since October 7, operating some 1,500 ambulances. The organization has also stocked the country with medical kits and blood bags, spreading them across the state should medics struggle with obstructed roads or network blackouts, MDA chief of staff Uri Shacham told CNN at the organization’s headquarters in Tel Aviv. A non-governmental body, MDA is in close contact with the Israeli military, Shacham said, adding that while it is unclear when an attack might take place. “We are prepared for it to happen in the next five minutes,” he said.

Jamaal Bowman in New York, a big-spending pro-Israel super PAC is hoping to help defeat another member of the “squad” – Missouri’s Cori Bush.","Aug 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Gregory Krieg,Middle East,"CNN — Six weeks after leading the charge to oust Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a New York primary, a big-spending pro-Israel super PAC is hoping to help defeat another member of the House “squad” of progressive Democrats – Missouri Rep. Cori Bush. Already a top target for centrist and Israel-aligned groups, Bush broke ranks with her party’s leadership to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza last year and has been fiercely critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinian civilians. Bush has drawn three challengers as she seeks a third term representing Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, the most prominent of whom is Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney of St. Louis County. The spending in the race has not matched the campaign against Bowman – the most expensive House primary in US history. Nevertheless, the figures – for a safe blue district and one of 435 House seats – are remarkable. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s super PAC, United Democracy Project, has spent nearly $9 million on ads attacking Bush or boosting Bell. Though Bell has been more supportive of Israel’s actions, his campaign has not focused on the issue, and voters in the majority-minority, urban district in the St. Louis area are not clashing over it with the passion seen in in more typically progressive enclaves. Taking a page from Democrat George Latimer, who defeated Bowman in New York in June, Bell’s campaign has been more vibes-based – criticizing Bush for being too ideologically-driven, not being responsive enough to her constituents and – perhaps most potently – voting against President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Ted Shaffrey/AP Related article George Latimer defeats House ‘squad’ member Jamaal Bowman in historic New York Democratic primary “She sold out our president, and she sold out the city of St. Louis,” a person says in a United Democracy Project ad . That vote, like Bowman’s, was lodged in protest of certain aspects of the infrastructure legislation. (The measure, however, had enough support to be passed without their votes.) An ad from the Mainstream Democrats PAC attacked Bush for being the subject of a federal investigation over alleged misuse of campaign funds for security services. Bush has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that she complied with House rules. Bush’s message during the campaign has been simpler and, in many ways, mimics Bowman’s efforts to cast the race as a battle between big money and the grassroots “By supporting our grassroots campaign,” Bush said in a recent fundraising email, “you’re standing up against a grifter politician and the influence of big money in politics and demanding real representation for the people of MO-01.” It’s a tactic that had, before this summer, been effective for progressive House members facing well-financed challengers. Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee fended off a primary challenge for her Pittsburgh-area seat earlier in the year and other “squad” members, most notably New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, are now widely seen as invulnerable. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell speaks during an interview in Clayton, Missouri, on July 29, 2019. Jeff Roberson/AP The Bush-Bell contest, though, is deeper than it is wide. There is no policy gulf to speak of; they are mostly aligned on the broad spectrum of issues that come before House members. They both have strong ties to 2014 police killing of Michael Brown , an unarmed Black teenager, in Ferguson, which is located in Missouri’s 1st District. The outrage around Brown’s death effectively launched the Black Lives Matter movement. Bush, a pastor, became a prominent activist in those demonstrations and she parlayed that profile into twice challenge the 1st District incumbent, William Lacy Clay, in the Democratic primary, succeeding in 2020 on her second attempt. Bell, in contrast, had an earlier start in the political arena. He was elected to the Ferguson City Council in 2015. Three years later, running on a progressive platform, he unseated the controversial St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who had been in office since 1991. But like McCulloch, Bell did not charge the officer who shot Brown, irritating some supporters – including Brown’s father, who was featured last month in an ad for Bush. “I feel like he lied to us. He never brought charges against the killer,” Brown Sr. says in the spot . “He never walked the streets of Ferguson with me. He failed to reform the office.” In late October 2023, weeks after Hamas’ deadly attack inside Israel, Bell backed out of a Senate run against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley to announce that he would challenge Bush instead. At a news conference at the time, he suggested that the congresswoman’s stance on the conflict – she was among the first to call for a ceasefire – drew him to the race. “Understand this unique place that we are with the world literally on fire,” Bell said. “I think that we need to make certain that we are providing that effective leadership, not only in our district but in DC and on the world stage.” Incidentally, a few months earlier, Bell had told Bush in a phone call – first reported by KSDK in St. Louis – that he had no intention of challenging her. “Don’t even think for even a second that that’s the case,” Bell told the congresswoman. “I’m telling you, on my word, I am not running against you. That is not happening.” US Vice President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at West Allis Central High School during her first campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 23, 2024.

Bell’s campaign hasn’t disputed what was said on the phone call, instead arguing that the assurance was given ahead of the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. His campaign manager told KSDK that Bell decided to leave the Senate primary for the House race after receiving “encouragement” from “stakeholders at the local, statewide, and national level.” Since then, it’s been a familiar proxy clash between old foes. AIPAC’s United Democracy Project and another pro-Israel group, Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, have invested in Bell’s cause, along with the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC and billionaire Reid Hoffman’s Mainstream Democrats PAC. In Bush’s corner, Justice Democrats, the group that became famous for recruiting Ocasio-Cortez to first run for office, and the Working Families Party are spending to defend their left-wing ally. The relative outlays, though, are stark – Bell-backers have outspent Bush’s side by about 3-to-1 on advertising. As the incumbent, Bush does have the backing, at least on paper, from House Democratic leadership, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are also on board. Ocasio-Cortez sent out fundraising appeals for the Bush campaign. At home, St. Louis City Mayor Tishaura Jones has also endorsed her. But support for Bell is robust locally too – often a more important mark of how a low-turnout primary will pan out than any other metric. Indivisible St. Louis endorsed Bell, who also has vast support from labor. The editorial board of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is also backing the challenger. Top Washington Democrats have been fairly quiet, not-so-subtly signaling that Bell will be welcome. Many are still cross with Bush for ousting Clay four years ago, breaking his family’s grip on a seat they’d held since before man walked on the moon.

Ali Elaydi Courtesy Ali Elaydi They also desperately need skilled physicians like me. I’m an orthopedic surgeon. Earlier this year I completed my training at Yale medical school and I now work at a small practice in Texas. Like many Americans, I have been eviscerated by images in the news of people who have lost limbs in the bombing by Israel or who were subject to crude amputation because an arm or leg was rendered useless after being crushed by falling masonry. As a physician, I felt compelled to help. I was able to travel to Gaza in April, to help those wounded by Israeli bombardments that have killed and injured thousands who have become trapped in buildings, struck by shrapnel or hurt during missile strikes on refugee camps. After a rule recently imposed by Israel, however, I’m no longer allowed to lend my medical expertise to help in Gaza. The medical mission I was part of, sponsored by an aid group called ‘FAJR’ Scientific , took place at the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, a facility that has since been evacuated. I planned to join a follow-up trip in June with the same aid organization and was to be placed at a hospital in central Gaza. I got as far as Jordan when I learned that I had been denied permission to reenter by Israeli authorities. The reason, I’m told, is that I am Palestinian. Palestinians wait for medical care at the European hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip in May, before the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of the facility. AFP/Getty Images I was born in a refugee camp in Gaza four years into the first Palestinian Intifada . At that time, Israeli forces had invaded Gaza. In those warlike conditions, violence was a normal part of our day-to-day life. We applied for political asylum in the US and were lucky enough to get it. I was five years old when we left. We were among the lucky few who were able to escape using that route. We fled Gaza as refugees. Most of my extended family still lives in Gaza.

I often felt guilty knowing that the loved ones I’d left behind would not benefit from the advantages that I got in the United States. I pursued a career path that would allow me to most impactfully give back to my homeland. Medicine was a natural choice, given my interests and aptitude. In every application, in every personal statement, and in each interview, I expressed a career goal: to provide medical relief to those suffering in Gaza, to help those who couldn’t escape the ravages of war as I had. In April, my orthopedic training at Yale was coming to an end, and the war in Gaza was raging. It almost seemed predestined that the conclusion of my long traineeship corresponded with the worst violence Gaza had seen. I knew it was time to make good on my promise and travel back to Gaza, to contribute my surgical skills, and to provide any assistance I could to a severely depleted healthcare system. That two-week medical mission was a life-changing experience, as much for the volunteers as for the people we were fortunate enough to be able to help. There were 14 of us: 10 orthopedic surgeons, four anesthesiologists. We did a lot of good on that trip, but when it was time to return to the US, we were aware of how much work we still had left to do. I signed up to take part in a monthlong followup mission in June.

Courtesy Ali Elaydi I had already received the necessary approvals from the United Nations and the World Health Organization. I arrived in Jordan several days before I and the other members of the medical team were to travel to Gaza. That’s when, just a few days before we were to depart, the organizers of the trip received a text saying that the Israeli authorities had approved everyone’s entry — but not mine. The message, which was forwarded to me, said that I had been “formally rejected due to Palestinian roots.” Memories of my upbringing, my escape and my first mission to Gaza came flooding back to me, but with an intensified sense of helplessness. A tragedy, my own personal Nakba, was unfolding. I could barely make sense of the words on my phone screen, so strong was my disbelief. Palestinian children stand in a camp for displaced people in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip in April. AFP/Getty Images Related article Opinion: How the suffering in Gaza is different from other conflicts Misery and immense need of the kind I had seen in Gaza is why I went into medicine, and why I wanted to do orthopedic surgery. During that April mission, it was never far from my mind that I was one decision away from still being among the people suffering there. I was able to escape Gaza as a child but that doesn’t make my life any more valuable than the lives of people who live there. I didn’t want to be one of those people who just talked about helping those in need. My training was done. This was my calling. This is why I went into medicine. Israeli policy has made giving back impossible, however. The phone text sent to the medical charitable group that Ali Elaydi had planned to join explaining that Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT — the agency that controls the flow of aid into Gaza — denied his entry into Gaza because of his Palestinian ancestry. Courtesy Ali Elaydi The policy decision exacerbates the already dire conditions in Gaza. The region’s health crisis is not an abstract statistic but a daily reality for millions of people. Hospitals are overwhelmed , medical supplies are scarce and trained medical personnel are even harder to find. Every doctor, every nurse, every healthcare worker makes a palpable difference. I’ve borne witness to this fact. That’s why refusing to allow doctors of certain backgrounds to volunteer cannot be considered simply a bureaucratic prerogative; it is a direct denial of health and well-being to the people of Gaza.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi) Jehad Alshrafi/AP Related article Opinion: In Gaza, fear of ‘the war after the war’ Israel’s policy excluding anyone with parents or grandparents who are Palestinian from being able to take part in humanitarian missions has meant that a lot of my friends who had signed up for upcoming missions were pulled from teams because of the same policy, whether they’ve ever previously set foot in Gaza or not. I suspect that it’s just one of many tactics employed by the Israeli government to restrict the flow of aid to Gaza. On the first mission I was on, I was able to take 10 suitcases of medication with me. On the one I wasn’t allowed to take part in, we were allowed one bag and no medications other than those for personal use. The international community must stand firm in condemning such practices and advocate for the sanctity of humanitarian assistance. The denial of a Palestinian doctor’s right to volunteer — in the process hindering the delivery of humanitarian efforts — is an affront.  Governments around the world, international organizations and individuals of influence should do what they can to help reverse this inhumane policy.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/sport/palestinian-olympic-swimmer-spt-intl/index.html,"Palestinian Olympic swimmer is living a personal dream, fighting for her homeland through sport",24-year-old Palestinian Olympic swimmer Valerie Tarazi tells CNN Sport that she fights for her country and “more recognition” through sport.,"Aug 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Rosanne Roobeek,Middle East,"Paris CNN — In the heart of Paris, the 2024 Summer Olympic Games are in full swing. The Games are unique in bringing athletes together from around the globe in a celebration of sport and unity. Among them is a small but determined group of athletes chosen to represent a nation embroiled in conflict. “This has been my personal dream for the longest time,” 24-year-old Valerie Tarazi told CNN Sport . “But I’m not here for myself.” Tarazi, a swimmer who competed in the 200-meter individual medley, is one of eight Palestinians competing in Paris. Just like every athlete talented enough to make it this far, the Olympic Games marks the culmination of decades of work and investment, but for these Palestinians, the Games represent more than just a sporting achievement. “The harder I train and the better I do, the more recognition Palestine gets,” Tarazi said. “That’s our mission, I fight for my country through sport.” The eight-strong team has formed a close-knit bond, driven by a shared sense of purpose. While most athletes have been consumed with training and peaking at the right time for a career defining opportunity to capture a medal, the Palestinian team’s journey to Paris has been fraught with challenges, both logistical and emotional. “We’re here [for each other] in the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. And we’ve talked about what we want to do as a mission, as athletes,” Tarazi said. “We want to spread our stories and the message of peace.” Flag bearer Tarazi was selected alongside boxer Wasim Abu Sal to carry the Palestinian flag at the opening ceremony. “Honestly, it’s the biggest honor that I can ever have,” she explains.

(AP Photo/Martin Dokoupil) Martin Dokoupil/AP Related article Gaza war weighs heavy on the minds of Palestinian Olympians: ‘I want to be an inspiration’ “Especially at a time where Palestine’s going through a war and a lot of people don’t want us to raise the flag. A lot of people don’t want us to be here. So being able to do that, go down the Seine , honor my family and honor my country means the world,” Tarazi continued. While Palestine does not have full international recognition and is a non-member observer state at the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognized the National Olympic Committee of Palestine as a member in 1995, allowing Palestinian athletes to compete in the Games. The significance of carrying the flag at an opening ceremony in France, a country that does not officially recognize the state of Palestine, was not lost on Tarazi. “Someone actually asked me the other day if the Palestinian flag is a symbol of resistance,” she said. “And, I said, ‘Every other country in the world has a flag. Why can’t we have a flag?’ We’re people, we’re just like everyone else, we’re just athletes, we want to be here and compete.” Casualties These Olympics are taking place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed since the October 7 Hamas attacks. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, as of July, around 400 athletes, coaches and sporting officials have been killed or wounded. Among the casualties in Gaza is Palestine’s first ever Olympian and the flag bearer from the 1996 Games, Majed Abu Maraheel, who reportedly died in the Nuseirat refugee camp earlier this year due to kidney failure. Photo illustration by CNN/Getty/Reuters Related article ‘On the roadsides there were shot up cars where people had been killed’: Facing war, death and destruction ahead of Olympics Asked about Maraheel, Tarazi reflects on following in his footsteps. “He did it for a greater cause, he did it for the Palestinian people. The same way I do it, the same way Wasim, our other flag bearer did it,” she said. “I raise the flag for all of those people, the very innocent victims that had honestly just passed away because of this conflict.” The emotional toll of the situation in Gaza is a constant challenge for the team. “Why do we have to be at the Olympics getting phone calls about our relatives dying?” Tarazi questioned. Some teammates have received such devastating calls, a grim reality that has sadly become the norm: “It’s almost like – we’re not numb to it because it still impacts us, but it’s a normal thing now. And it shouldn’t be.” The reality of the situation on the ground in Gaza is rarely far from Tarazi’s mind in Paris. “I use the fire from everyone else when I am going through a hard time. I just think I could be with my family in Gaza right now, and I could be with my friends who are struggling to find clean water and my little bit of pain or suffering, or one stupid comment. You know, that doesn’t mean anything compared to what they’re going through.” Support and hope Despite the challenges, the athletes have found solace and support from Palestinians worldwide. Messages of encouragement and solidarity have poured in, reminding them of the importance of their mission. “I’ve received so much love and support from people in Gaza,” Tarazi noted. “That means the world to me, that they know I’m here to represent my family, my roots, and everything like that.” For Tarazi and her teammates, the Olympics are a rare opportunity to shine a light on the Palestinian experience and to inspire hope through sport. The fact that there is no regulation-sized pool in all of Gaza underscores the significant obstacles they face in developing athletic talent. “For the basic human right of sport to just not be a reality in Palestine, that breaks my heart,” she said. “It’s given me life skills that I can use for everything. So I know that’s definitely what we’re looking for the future: making sport a human right.” As the Palestinian team competes in Paris, Tarazi says they are not just athletes, they are ambassadors for peace, unity, and resilience. “We want to inspire the younger generation, the next generation of athletes,” Tarazi said. “We all have a common goal. We all strive to promote the Olympic Charter in peace, unity, and solidarity. And that’s so important to everyone here.” French singer Yseult performs ""My Way"" at the end of the Olympic closing ceremony as fireworks go off above the Stade de France on Sunday, August 11.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/middleeast/lebanon-travel-warning-middle-east-tensions-intl/index.html,Foreign citizens urged to leave Lebanon ‘as soon as possible’ as regional tensions spike,Countries are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible” amid heightening tensions in the region.,"Aug 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Saskya Vandoorne,Middle East,"CNN — Several countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and France have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as heightened tensions in the region spark fears of a widening Middle East conflict. The warnings come after the US said it was sending additional warships to the region and as Washington’s embassy in Lebanon called on citizens to book “any ticket available to them.” Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy said his message for British citizens was, “leave now.” The region is on high alert after Iran vowed revenge on Israel, which it blames for the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the capital Tehran earlier this week. Haniyeh’s death came just hours after an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr. In the latest flurry of diplomatic activity, Iran’s state news agency (IRNA) reported that the Foreign Minister of Jordan was making a rare visit to the Iranian capital Tehran on Sunday, to “meet and exchange views with Iranian officials regarding bilateral, regional and international issues.” The developments have raised concerns that Israel’s war in Gaza, which is now well into its ninth month, could spill over into a full-blown Middle Eastern conflict. It is thought that Lebanon-based Hezbollah could play a prominent part in any such retaliation. The militant group has been involved in daily exchanges of fire with Israel; overnight on Saturday Hezbollah fired 30 projectiles, most of which were intercepted by Israel. On Monday, Hezbollah claimed to have launched a drone attack that hit a military target in northern Israel, calling it retaliation for the recent assassinations and a show of support for Gaza. Israel launched multiple interceptors at “suspicious aerial targets” that crossed from Lebanon into Upper Galilee, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Two IDF personnel were injured after one target was downed and firefighters were extinguishing a blaze in the area. In a separate statement, the IDF claimed to have struck “multiple” Hezbollah targets in Lebanon overnight, including a weapons storage facility. It also said it had identified and shot down a “suspicious aerial target” that crossed from Lebanon Monday morning, and had observed a “hostile explosive UAV” that crossed from Lebanon and fell in the area of Malkia. No damage or injuries were reported from the incidents. Many countries already had travel warnings in place but have issued fresh advice in the wake of the latest developments. Smoke billows at the Israeli-Lebanon border from the site of a rocket fired from the Lebanese side, towards the Israeli village of Metullah on Saturday. AFP/Getty Images France told its citizens to make arrangements to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible” in a statement from the Ministry for Europe and Foreign affairs on Sunday. Jordan issued a similar warning to its citizens. The country was involved in shooting down Iranian drones when Iran launched unprecedented retaliatory strikes in April for a suspected Israeli attack on a diplomatic complex. Turkey meanwhile updated its travel advisory for Lebanon, urging those who do not need to stay in the country to leave while commercial flights remain active. “Our citizens should avoid traveling to Lebanon unless it is essential; Our citizens in Lebanon are advised to be cautious, not to go to Nabatiyeh, South Lebanon, Bekaa and Baalbek-Hermel provinces unless necessary, and those who do not need to stay in Lebanon are advised to leave Lebanon, if possible, while commercial flights are still continuing,” Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Öncü Keçeli posted to X on Sunday. Airlines including Air France, Lufthansa and Kuwaiti Airlines have already canceled flights to and from Lebanon while others diverted planes away from the country. Preparing for ‘every possibility’ In a further sign of the region bracing for an Iranian retaliation, the US on Saturday sent a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East. It marked perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting. White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Sunday that the US and Israel are preparing for “every possibility” after the Pentagon sent the additional military assets. “We and our ally Israel are preparing for every possibility. And that’s the vein in which the announcements made by the Pentagon took place. All of those posture adjustments are to prepare for a potential response against Israel from Iran or any other adversary,” Finer told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” And on Sunday, US State Secretary Antony Blinken spoke with the foreign ministers from G7 nations to discuss the “urgent need for de-escalation in the Middle East,” according to a State Department spokesperson. The spokesperson said Blinken and the foreign ministers discussed ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire that would secure hostage releases and the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. They also reiterated their commitment to Israel’s security and urged “maximum restraint from all parties” to keep the conflict from escalating. Israelis have been stocking up on supplies, while a file from the Jerusalem municipality advised residents to “clean and prepare their bomb shelters,” warning they must be able to reach shelters in 90 seconds.

Rescue operations continue in hopes that some people remain alive under the destroyed buildings, which had been serving as shelters for displaced families, he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency have taken responsibility for the strike, saying that they were targeting “terrorists operating inside Hamas command and control centers” that were “embedded” within the schools. The IDF did not respond to CNN’s questions regarding the number of Hamas members and civilians killed in the strike, or whether civilians were warned of the strike in advance.

The two school buildings housed hundreds of displaced people, primarily women and children, according to the local journalist. Both schools were in a densely populated residential area. Palestinian officials told CNN that Israel did not give civilians any warning before the airstrikes occurred. “If a warning had been given, the number of deaths would have been lower,” Basal said. Sunday’s strike follows a series of strikes on the Al-Huda and Al-Hamama schools — also targeting alleged Hamas infrastructure, according to the IDF — that left at least 17 dead on Saturday. In that case, Basal said, “the first bombing was unexpected and resulted in a large number of martyrs and injured individuals. While the martyrs and injured were being retrieved, the occupation forces issued a warning that another strike was imminent.” The death toll from Israeli military action in Gaza since October 7 reached 39,583 on Sunday, with a further 91,398 people injured, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

I send my condolences to the families of the murdered and best wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured.” Netanyahu praised the police officers who “eliminated the terrorist,” adding “we will reckon with everyone who cooperated with him.” Israel’s Minister for State Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site of the attack and repeated a call for Israelis to arm themselves. “I share in the grief of the families and wish a full recovery to the wounded. Our war is not only against Iran, but here in the streets. This is exactly why we armed the people of Israel. More than 150,000 licenses for weapons in the last eight months,” he said, urging people to “carry a weapon, it saves lives.” Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israelis to arm themselves following the attack. Mahmoud Illean/AP Palestinian militant groups celebrated the attack in Holon, with the Popular Resistance Committees, an umbrella organization of armed groups, and the Al-Qassam Brigades posting messages of support on their social media channels. Hamas said in a statement that it “mourns” the perpetrator of the attacks, who it described as a “martyred hero.” “Hamas views this act as a natural response to ongoing Israeli occupation crimes against the Palestinian people, including brutal acts in Gaza, escalating violations in the West Bank, and the assassination of movement leader Ismail Haniyeh,” it said. The assassination of Haniyeh , Hamas’ political leader, earlier this week further heightened tensions at an already volatile time, raising fears that Israel’s conflict with Hamas and its allies could develop into a multi-front, fully-fledged war in the Middle East. Attacks on Israeli civilians are not uncommon, though they usually take place in areas such as Jerusalem and the West Bank, where large populations of both Israelis and Palestinians live. Last July, eight people were injured after a car driver rammed into pedestrians near a Tel Aviv shopping center and then got out of the vehicle to stab civilians.

Often bustling with crowds on a weekend, the coastal city of more than 400,000 residents was quieter than usual, with some attributing the subdued mood to fears of an Iranian attack in retaliation to the assassinations carried out against Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was on “high alert,” and Israeli supermarkets are reporting a spike in shopping for basic goods as citizens stock up. On Wednesday, Netanyahu said that his country “struck crushing blows” to the “the three H’s” – Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, all Iranian-backed, all fierce Israeli foes. The prime minister was celebrating the assassination of Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif , Hezbollah military commander Fu’ad Shukr and retaliatory strikes on the Houthis in Yemen last month. Hamas also blamed Israel for the assassination of their political leader, Ismail Haniyeh , who was killed on Wednesday in Tehran. Israel has not commented on the killing. Netanyahu’s tone stands at odds with the mood on the ground in Tel Aviv, including among families of the hostages still in Gaza. Video Ad Feedback Israeli hostage relative on her ‘worst fear’ after assassination of Hamas political leader 01:31 - Source: CNN Four of Yifat Zailer’s relatives are still held in Gaza by Hamas – Zailer’s cousin Shiri and her husband Yarden, along with their two sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, who spent his first birthday in captivity in January. The Bibas boys remain the youngest of 111 hostages still held in Gaza since October 7, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. In November, Hamas released a video of Yarden Bibas blaming Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two children in an airstrike. CNN has not confirmed the deaths nor the claim of the airstrike. “I thought this would end quicker,” Zailer told CNN’s Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv, saying she is frustrated with the Israeli government because it isn’t listening to what people are saying on the streets. “I feel they (the government) don’t hear it’s enough; I feel they don’t hear the people on the streets shouting, that our priority is getting the hostages back,” Zailer said. Polls have repeatedly shown that most Israelis prioritize the release of hostages over continued war. Israeli hostage Kfir Bibas. Hostages Missing Families Forum Related article Family marks the first birthday of Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage taken into Gaza A recent survey conducted by independent research center the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) showed that 56% of Israelis support a deal to release all the hostages and end the war in Gaza. It also showed that most right-wing Israelis have a greater appetite for the war. “A large majority of those on the left and in the center consider a deal for the release of hostages to be the highest priority,” the survey said, “while the majority on the right prioritize a military operation in Rafah.” Zailer’s family was taken from Kibbutz Nir Or on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel retaliated by waging a war in Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say killed more than 39,000 people in the enclave, most of whom are women and children. The war has also displaced almost all of Gaza’s population, flattened much of the strip and triggered a humanitarian crisis. But Netanyahu has said that the war will continue until Hamas is eliminated, a goal deemed unrealistic by his critics. Hopes that a deal that would release Zailer’s family, along with the more than 100 other hostages, have ebbed and flowed throughout the past ten months of war. The spike in tensions last week only raised the worst of fears. Zailer worries she will wake up one day to find that all the hostages had been killed, she said, “because they (Hamas) decided they have nothing to gain out of them.” ‘We’re waiting for an attack’ As families worry for their loved ones in Gaza, those in Israel are bracing for a possible Iranian retaliation, a move that could plunge the Middle East into an all-out war that drags in other regional players and potentially the United States. On Tel Aviv’s main beach promenade, some Israelis are spending their Saturday swimming and surfing, knowing an Iranian attack could hit their city at any moment. “We’re waiting for an attack, that’s the general feeling now,” Itay Oved, 29, told CNN. While Israelis are used to attacks, he said, many are also tired.

Alona Lelchuk, 31, said this war feels different, however, mainly because there are hostages still in captivity. “We can’t be too proud,” she told CNN. “We need to be alert, we cannot celebrate.” Netanyahu has been accused of losing focus of one of the main purposes of the war, which was to bring back those kidnapped. Without a ceasefire deal, they are unlikely to come home. But the Israeli leader has been under pressure from far-right ministers of his coalition to delay a ceasefire deal and press on with the war in Gaza, which today shows few signs of ending. Even before the last escalation, the prime minister has been accused by critics of obstructing negotiations leading to a deal, and instead clinging to an extended war in efforts to ensure his political survival and that of his coalition. Zailer is worried that as the war drags on and the death tolls rise in Gaza, her concerns for the hostages become less and less “legitimate” in the eyes of the world, especially as Israel increasingly loses international support for its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave. She also worries for the children, Israeli and Palestinian, who will be forced to grow up with the wounds of this drawn-out war. “The children that will grow out of this war will remain with this wound and this fear and this pain,” Zailer told CNN. “On both sides.” CNN’s Eugenia Yosef and Tim Lister contributed reporting."

The demonstrations – a regular occurrence – were notable for taking place despite urgent security warnings as Israel braces for a possible strike from Iran. Some form of military retaliation has been widely expected in the region following the unclaimed assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. Despite the tense security situation, large crowds gathered to Begin Gate in Tel Aviv on Saturday to support the families of the hostages and to call for their release from captivity, according to protest organizers. Videos showed protestors waving Israeli flags and holding up signs with images of the Israeli hostages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a conference in Jerusalem, on February 18.

There are currently 115 total hostages, living and dead, being held in Gaza, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Of that number, 111 hostages were taken during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, which killed over 1,200 people. Israeli’s ensuing military offensive in the isolated Palestinian enclave has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly 2 million, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health and the United Nations. ‘Tell the public the truth’ Family members of captives held in Gaza have harshly criticized Netanyahu’s approach to the conflict, and are now demanding a public explanation for his government’s failure so far to negotiate a deal that would see the remaining Israeli hostages liberated. In a statement released Saturday, an association representing the families accused the Israeli leader of choosing “to escalate the situation instead of securing a deal that would save lives.” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also posted a statement on Telegram calling on Israel’s security chiefs to “tell the public the truth,” writing: “If the government of Israel has given up on the hostages, it needs to be honest with the families and stop playing games.” Anger and impatience over the slow pace of hostage releases from Gaza flared this week following a new report that Netanyahu clashed with top advisors on whether to accept a new hostage and ceasefire deal proposal, which the Israeli Prime Minister Office has rejected as “incorrect.” Supporters and relatives of Israelis held hostage by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip since October lift placards during a rally to demand their release in Tel Aviv on August 3, 2024. Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images Israel’s Channel 12 reported that, at a tense meeting of Israel’s security council on Wednesday night, senior officials had urged Netanyahu to take a hostage and ceasefire deal with Gaza militant group Hamas. The report claimed that Mossad director David Barnea had said “there is a deal ready and that Israel must take it,” while Ronen Bar, the head of Israeli security agency Shin Bet, said it appeared to him the prime minister did not want the outline of the deal on the table.

The description that Hamas supposedly agreed to the terms of the deal is false…” it said. Netanyahu’s office on Saturday released another statement accusing “leaks and false briefings in the media” of misleading the public, and blaming Hamas for hindering negotiations. “While Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to the deal outline, Hamas has been trying to introduce dozens of changes that, de facto, nullify the outline,” the statement said.

In a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday, Biden said the US would “support Israel’s defense against threats,” which would include “new defensive US military deployments,” according to a readout of the call. The statement did not detail what new deployments would occur ahead of an anticipated Iranian attack in response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. According to several US officials, the Pentagon has discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region, but no final decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon.  The officials said an Iranian response could occur in the coming days. The USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group, which includes the aircraft carrier, destroyers and other warships, has been operating in the Gulf of Oman in recent weeks. The strike group could potentially move into the Gulf of Aden or the Red Sea, where Navy warships have intercepted dozens of Houthi launches over the past several months. The USS Wasp amphibious assault ship and several other Navy vessels are currently operating in the Mediterranean Sea. The group includes a Marine expeditionary unit capable of carrying out an evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon if the US ordered such an evacuation. Biden said late Thursday night he is “very concerned” about escalating tensions in the Middle East. “We’re very concerned about it. I had a very direct meeting with (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) today. And – very direct. We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it, and they should move on it now,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Asked whether the assassination of Haniyah impacted the chance of a ceasefire, he said it has “not helped.” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) promised a “harsh” and “painful” response to the assassination . Israel has not commented on the killing. The Iranian response to the killing of Haniyeh may include attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria from Iranian-backed proxy militias in the region, according to the officials. For months, the militias launched scores of attacks on US forces in the Middle East, but those largely subsided after a drone attack killed three US service members in Jordan in January. Officials say Iran could instruct those groups to start firing on US forces once again. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that “international partners” have bolstered their forces in the region, though he did not specify which countries. “We have very good defense systems,” he said of Israel’s own preparations for an attack, “and in addition we have international partners who have reinforced their forces [deployed] in the region, to help us counter the threats.” A Defense Department spokesman said Thursday the Pentagon has no information to provide on the movement of US forces or changes to force condition at this time. The US is expecting the anticipated Iranian attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones launched against Israel on April 13, officials said. But this attack could be larger and more complicated than before, including the possibility of a coordinated attack with Iranian proxies from multiple directions. A coalition of countries, including Jordan and other Arab states, came together in April to share intelligence and intercept the Iranian barrage. But officials say it’s unclear if such a coalition could be stood up again so quickly and whether all of the countries are willing to participate once again. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of its top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. “Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday. The US still believes that no one in the region is interested in an all-out war engulfing the Middle East, officials say, but a potential miscalculation risks sparking a broader conflict.

According to the source, who had been briefed on the operation, the bomb was concealed about two months ago in the guest house where Haniyeh was known to stay in Tehran and detonated remotely once he was inside his room there. The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. US officials were briefed on the operation by Israeli officials only after the assassination, the source said. The New York Times was the first to report the details of Haniyeh’s assassination. Haniyeh’s assassination raised fears once again that Israel’s conflict with Hamas and its allies could develop into a multi-front, fully-fledged war in the Middle East. Iranian state media and Hamas previously indicated that Haniyeh was killed by a rocket fired from outside the building in which he was staying. But the revelation that a bomb was smuggled inside the guest house, which was under the protection of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, indicates a startling breach of security for the IRGC. CNN has sought comment from the Iranian government. An image published by the New York Times shows the building where Haniyeh is believed to have been assassinated. A corner of the building is now covered with a green cloth. Apparent debris also litters the ground floor roof of the building, directly underneath the green cloth. From Telegram/The New York Times It’s unclear when Haniyeh arrived in Tehran, but Iranian state media first reported that he would be flying in to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president on Monday. He had a full schedule of public appearances and meetings before he was assassinated, according to Iranian state media press reports. Haniyeh was first pictured on Tuesday, before the inauguration, meeting with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Iranian state media published images of Haniyeh meeting with Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian. Haniyeh was next spotted arriving at the inauguration ceremony at Iran’s Islamic Consultative Assembly building, where he sat in the front row. Just before 7:00 p.m. local time (11:30 a.m. ET), Haniyeh made his final public appearance at an exhibit at Tehran’s Milad Tower. At 2 a.m. that night, according to state media outlet IRNA, he was killed, with what IRNA described as an “airborne guided projectile.” Iranians gather for the memorial procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, August 1.

According to Hamas and Qatari state media, Haniyeh’s funeral prayer will be held after the Friday prayer at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque in the Qatari capital, followed by the burial at the Imam Founder Cemetery in Lusail city. Video obtained by CNN showed Haniyeh’s wife, Umm al-Abed, crying over the coffin and mourning her husband. “You strengthened us every day, making us as strong and determined as iron. We owe it all to you,” she said. His death marked the start of an unpredictable new phase of Israel’s war with Hamas, coming just hours on from an Israeli strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr, whom it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah said Thursday that Israel’s killing of its top commander had “crossed red lines” and would be met with an “inevitable” response, hinting at coordination with other regional groups. Nasrallah delivered his speech remotely from a large screen in front of a crowd of mourners attending the funeral of Shukr, the highest-ranking Hezbollah commander to be killed by Israel since Mustafa Badreddine in 2016. Nasrallah said Israel’s strike in southern Beirut had prompted a “new phase” in the low-intensity battles between Israel and Iran-backed forces in the region. Iran-backed allies in the region include Iraqi proxy militias, the Houthis in Yemen and groups in Syria. ‘IDF is on high alert’ The chief spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Thursday that Israel was ready to face a range of scenarios amid heightened tension in the region. “The IDF is on high alert, on both defense and offense. IDF forces are deployed in the air, at sea and on the ground, and are prepared for all scenarios, especially for offensive plans within the immediate timeframe.” Hagari said at a briefing Thursday: “We have very good defense systems and in addition we have international partners who have reinforced their forces [deployed] in the region, to help us counter the threats.” But he cautioned that Israel’s defenses were “not hermetically sealed.” Hagari noted: “Iran has been running over the past few years a terror infrastructure, to smuggle Iranian explosive devices into Israeli territory to perpetrate attacks. We will continue operating against the Iranian terror with determination.” Several Israeli agencies and services are stepping up readiness, following the Israeli strike that killed Shukr and threats from Iran that it would retaliate following the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran.

A former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservist has alleged serious misconduct by Israeli forces in Gaza, and a lack of discipline in the command structure, in an interview with CNN.","Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Ami Kaufman,Middle East,"CNN — Destroyed homes, looting, and a desire for revenge. A former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservist has alleged serious misconduct by Israeli forces in Gaza, and a lack of discipline in the command structure, in an interview with CNN. Yuval Green, a 26-year-old former paratrooper, is one of a handful of soldiers who have served in Israel’s war against Hamas and are now publicly criticizing the way it is being prosecuted. Green described the behavior and alleged misdeeds of his reservist peers while serving in the Palestinian enclave, and the day he decided to tell his commanders he could no longer be part of his unit. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 others abducted in the assault, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli military action in the strip has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the United Nations. Green, who served as a medic in his unit, told CNN that prior to October 7 – when he was recruited for reserve duty – he had intended to leave the army, objecting to its conduct in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He had planned to tell his comrades on October 8, but after Hamas attacked, he felt duty-bound to support them as they were mobilized for the war. “When the 7th of October struck, it was difficult for me at this time to tell them that I’m not willing to come with them,” Green said. “So I decided to join my friends … I didn’t know what would be the right thing to do.” Yuval Green, a former Israeli paratrooper, speaks to CNN. CNN Atmosphere of ‘demonizing Gazans’ Green told CNN that he served in the Gaza perimeter in November last year before being sent into the strip on December 2, spending 51 days in the city of Khan Younis , in the south. He said that the anger felt by Israelis after October 7 and calls for revenge were expressed openly in his unit, as they waited to be sent into Gaza, and called it the “demonizing” of Palestinians. “In the days before we entered Khan Younis … there was this atmosphere that was kind of growing of demonizing the Gazans,” he said, adding that he heard people “speaking about killing, ruining all of Gaza. Wiping it out became something that people (were discussing), as if it was some kind of a legitimate idea.” IDF rules of engagement in Gaza have been under great scrutiny. Green claims that IDF commanders on the ground seemed to acquiesce to soldiers’ desires to have fewer restrictions on their conduct than in previous incursions. “I felt like my commanders were trying to kind of go with the soldiers and try to say things that they thought … (were) what the soldiers wanted to hear. You know, saying things like, ‘We’re not going to have any boundaries in Gaza this time.’” Green said he did not serve during earlier cycles of violence in Gaza but took part in guard duty on the Gaza perimeter and in the West Bank, as well as training.

Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images/File ‘We don’t care enough’ about Palestinian lives The war in Gaza has caused widespread material destruction to homes, infrastructure, hospitals and schools. Green says he witnessed the “unnecessary” destruction of Palestinian homes. “We’ve seen a lot of destruction that was not necessarily related to military reasons. Everything tends to (get) really mix up, you know – people are destroying houses because they believe that they should (get) revenge (for) what happened on (October 7) and it mixes up with the reasons to destroy houses for military reasons,” Green said, adding he witnessed “chaos … I could tell you 100% that we’ve destroyed houses at least for reasons that … we don’t care enough about the lives of Palestinians.” Describing the extent of the damage in Gaza, he said, “You can’t imagine it. Cities that are completely ruined.” Palestinians carry out search and rescue operations following an airstrike on December 7, 2023, in Khan Younis. Ahmad Hasaballah/Getty Images/File Accusations of looting Green told CNN that one of the things that bothered him most was witnessing what he alleged was the looting of Palestinian homes by soldiers in his own unit. “You’re seeing looting by your peers all the time. That was something (that) was very difficult for me to see. I mean, people were taking ‘souvenirs’ (from) the Palestinians’ houses, which I think directly relates to the demonization we’ve seen before the entrance to Khan Younis,” he said. “People were taking, you know, necklaces and doing graffiti on the walls and … leaving behind damage to the houses that was just completely unnecessary.” When asked if he thinks this behavior was condoned by IDF commanders, Green said that officially, they disapproved of such conduct – but were unable to stop it.

Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images Related article Killing of Hamas leader leaves Gaza ceasefire hopes dangling by a thread “The superior commanders of the IDF, I think they do believe that this shouldn’t happen – looting or graffiti,” Green said. “But I don’t think (the IDF) has the resources to stop it, and I think, you know, it all comes down to the soldiers (in) the field. You can’t stop any soldier from doing things.” While witnessing the alleged looting, Green said he confronted his peers, which resulted in “a lot of arguments,” but he was unable to sway his superiors to act: “Some of them agreed with me, some of them didn’t – or some of them, you know, were in between.” “But all of them weren’t able to control our actions.” The decision to leave In the end, one specific moment pushed Green to make the tough decision to leave his unit: when a commander allegedly ordered the burning of a Palestinian home they were stationed in. “At some point, my commander told my platoon to burn down the house we’re staying at,” Green recounted. “And I went to him, I approached him and I asked him, ‘Why are we doing that?’ And he gave me a few reasons, and I think those reasons were just not strong enough.” “They were, you know, military type of reasons, but they (were mixed up with) the revenge type of reasons. Now, I think this is just what’s going on in Gaza. Israel is doing things because it needs to fulfil a type of military purpose, but it all mixes up with our need for – or the Israeli need for – revenge.” Illustration by Alberto Mier/CNN Related article The US held off sanctioning this Israeli army unit despite evidence of abuses. Now its forces are shaping the fight in Gaza “I said, ‘I’m not willing to participate in that. I’m not destroying a house that belonged to a few families that would become homeless because of that – and I’m leaving.’ And I just (left) with the next car that went out.” Green said he decided to speak out publicly to put pressure on the Israeli government to accept a ceasefire and hostage deal . The Israeli government said this week that it was Hamas leadership that was preventing an agreement. “I think there are concrete deals on the table right now, that Hamas is agreeing to, that make sense. I mean, those deals say that all the hostages would be freed – and Israel is not accepting the ending of the war. And this is crazy,” Green said. Green added that Israel’s alleged refusal to accept a deal was causing the deaths of hostages. “I’ve seen it from within,” he said. “I mean, we said nothing before we entered Gaza about the hostages. We could have killed them, you know, any moment, and it’s something that has happened. We know about more than 10 hostages that were killed directly from Israeli bombings or, you know, the three hostages that were killed,” referring to an incident of friendly fire by the IDF in December, in which soldiers fatally shot three hostages . The possibility that hostages have been killed during Israeli bombardments is a sensitive one in Israel. There have been occasions when officials have announced that hostages were believed to have been killed while in captivity, but at no point have any such announcements been attributed to Israeli airstrikes. The Israeli army has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on Green’s claims. “We have to tell our government to stop the war. This is the only right solution to save the lives of Palestinians that are dying every day and going through a living hell the past few months, saving the lives of soldiers, Israeli soldiers, that are now present in Gaza and dying every day, and obviously the lives of hostages.” Israeli military vehicles in southern Israel, near the border with Gaza, on December 25, 2023. Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images/File Facing criticism at home In June, Green cosigned a letter with 40 other reservists refusing to serve in the southern Gaza city of Rafah . He is one of only three soldiers who have come out publicly, and his family and friends have voiced concern over his decisions. “Obviously it’s something very controversial in Israel, but I was willing to sacrifice, you know, my privacy and (to come) out with a topic as controversial as that, because I believe that right now, it’s a matter of life and death. “When people are criticizing me for that, and I’ve heard people … that said they were worried that I might get hurt in that process – that always felt very weird because, you know, I went inside Gaza. I literally have risked my life. But people are now more afraid that I might get hurt, you know, by just coming out with words,” he added. “It’s part of the problem with our situation right now.” Reflecting on the violence committed by Hamas, he also urged Palestinians not to support Hamas or call for an intifada: “They don’t understand that those calling for violence are damaging the Palestinian cause, and have been killing Palestinians for years now … I support Palestine too, but don’t confuse between supporting Palestine and supporting the violence of Hamas.” CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on Green’s allegations. Responding to Green’s allegations, the IDF stated: “The actions of the IDF and its operational activity in particular are subject to Israeli law and international law, which is reflected, among other things, in the rules of engagement among other military orders … IDF commanders are guided by values of the IDF ​​and lead the soldiers on the battlefield in a professional manner. When events that defer from the expected conduct occur, they are handled by the commanders as required. “In some cases, IDF forces are required to act to remove a threat posed to them from buildings located in the territory of the Gaza Strip. The destruction of buildings is done with the appropriate means. Actions done otherwise, and not as a result of operational needs, are contrary to the army’s orders and the IDF’s values ​​and are examined. Taking property that is not in accordance with the army’s orders is prohibited by law and is not in line with the values ​​of the IDF. Incidents in which forces acted not in accordance with the orders and the law are examined and will continue to be examined, including as part of investigations by the MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation Division). As a general rule, when details concerning concrete events are given, they are reviewed and dealt with accordingly.”"

The claim of Deif’s death comes a day after Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran. An Israeli military official told CNN they received new intelligence in recent hours that gave them the confidence to confirm Deif was killed, nearly three weeks after it carried out the strike in Khan Younis. The official declined to specify the nature of that intelligence. There was no immediate statement from Hamas. CNN has approached the militant group for comment. Palestinians cycle past destroyed buildings leveled in a previous Israeli military bombardment of Beit Lahia, in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday. Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images Related article Killing of Hamas leader leaves Gaza ceasefire hopes dangling by a thread A Hamas official wrote on Telegram that only the group’s military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, is able to confirm or deny Deif’s death. Izzat Al Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said that unless the Al Qassam leadership announces it, “no news published in the media or by any other parties can be confirmed.” A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had conducted a “precise, targeted strike” on a compound where Deif and another commander Rafe Salama were staying. The IDF announced Salama’s death last month. In recent weeks Israeli officials said they had indications their strike was successful but were not able to confirm that he was killed until now. The strike targeting Deif in Khan Younis on July 13 hit a designated humanitarian zone, killing at least 90 Palestinians. Footage from the Al-Mawasi displacement camp showed bodies in the street and destroyed tents. An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the architects of the October 7 attacks . He led the Palestinian militant group’s armed wing for more than two decades. Israel has repeatedly stated that one of its main war aims is to eliminate Hamas in Gaza. Deif’s death would make him the highest-ranking Hamas military official killed in the strip since the start of the war more than nine months ago.

Handout/Israel Defense Forces Israel says it has killed or captured half of Hamas’s commanders and more than 14,000 combatants since the war began. However, there are clear signs of the group’s resurgence in parts of the strip previously cleared by Israeli forces, who devastated large swathes of the area in the process. Israeli troops have been drawn back to these previously cleared parts of the territory, fighting pitched battles with Hamas units who were previously declared dismantled. Meanwhile, the group’s top leadership are likely to have had their communications compromised by the heavy bombardment, according to experts, with units operating more autonomously in their severely degraded form, and employing guerrilla tactics, such as laying booby traps and staging ambushes.

Born as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as “El Deif” or “the Guest” due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel.

This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated.” “Israel’s defense establishment will pursue Hamas terrorists – both the planners and the perpetrators of the 07.10 massacre. We will not rest until this mission is accomplished,” he added. This is a developing story and will be updated."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/analysis-iran-options-ismail-haniyeh-killing-intl/index.html,Iran has no good options after two deadly strikes on senior allies,One of the few things working in Iran’s favor after the humiliating news that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital overnight is that the regime controls most of the information the world gets to see.,"Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Nick Paton Walsh,Middle East,"CNN — One of the few things working in Iran’s favor after the humiliating news that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital overnight is that the regime controls most of the information the world gets to see. What Iran has said so far is that Haniyeh died after being hit by an “airborne guided projectile” in Tehran where he was attending the inauguration of the Iranian president. But we know little else. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the strike but has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leaders following the October 7 attacks. Haniyeh’s death came hours after Israel confirmed it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon , on Tuesday that killed the most senior military commander of Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed militant group, who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The precise details of what happened at around 2 a.m. (5.30 p.m. ET) in Tehran, will dictate what comes next, as Iran looks to present a narrative that justifies and fashions its response. Whatever the truth and whatever Iran proffers, the attack is clearly a grave violation of its sovereignty and the supposed security bubble of the Iranian capital. Haniyeh was the regime’s guest, and its role as a regional power is compromised if it’s unable to guarantee the simple safety of visiting allies. There are reports he was staying in a guest house for veterans, and it is unclear whose technical responsibility it was to protect this facility – and whether the elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) will be explicitly embarrassed, outside of the wider humiliation of an apparent Israeli assassination deep inside of Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is seen with Haniyeh -- hours before his assassination. Handout/Office of Iran's Supreme Leader/AFP/Getty Images But Iran has stomached comparable violations in the past. The death of its leading nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was met with limited wrath in 2020. The killing of Quds commander Qasem Suleinami, the country’s most fabled military figure, months earlier, led to fiery rhetoric, but instead a limited hit on a remote US base. Iran has stepped back before – and may do so again. There is no shortage of furious rherotic the day after the strikes, but there is no easy route for Iran. It is clear Tehran has been reluctant, for the months since October 7, to launch its most ferocious proxy, Hezbollah, into a full-scale war with Israel from Lebanon. Putting aside the huge humanitarian horror such a conflict would muster for Lebanese and Israelis alike, Hezbollah remains a powerful card that Tehran gets to play probably once. The regime retains apparent ambitions in its nuclear program and a military eroded by sanctions, so Hezbollah is an ace that must be tabled with astute timing. Iran has also tried an unprecedented direct all-out attack on Israel before, in April, after senior IRGC commanders were killed in an Israeli strike on Damascus. In short, the 300 drone and missiles fired - straight from Iran at Israel - just didn’t get through. Around 99% of them were intercepted. Damage after the strike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday. Ahmad Al-Kerdi/Reuters The regime’s response to Haniyeh’s death will define its role as a regional power, and, if it fails to appear potent enough, risks that slipping. A stealthy, asymmetric strike, weeks from now, may not fix the damage done to its prestige. The risk of the unchartered territory we are in is that the gravity of expected responses is not defined – the tit for tat is occurring in an environment evolving by the day. Indeed, the characters making the decisions are changing rapidly, or under intense domestic pressure themselves. This simply accentuates the risk of miscalculation, or of actions taken to satisfy selfish, insular concerns, rather than a wider regional impact. In short, it is a mess that grows, and with it surges the chance of the unexpected. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s first statement on the matter said of Israel, “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment.” But remember this is a superannuated, octogenarian leader who has just endured years of popular unrest and rising conflict with Israel, and 24 hours ago saw a surprisingly moderate president, Masoud Pezeshkian, get sworn in. He is projecting strength internally as much as he is internationally. Separately, Hezbollah had stumbled it seemed into an acute crisis though the militant group’s apparently mistaken targeting of Druze schoolchildren in the Golan Heights at the weekend. It may feel the strike on Haniyeh has removed the spotlight to respond, for the shortest while, although it may be dragged into Iran’s eventual response. But the fact the assassination of its commander, Fuad Shukr, now seems like a distant memory, exposing how rapidly events are unfolding. Tehran is taking its time to reveal how, yet again, its innermost sanctum was violated by Israel. The IRGC trailed a statement about Haniyeh at 2.50 a.m. US time, but it eventually avoided most details of how he was killed. Perhaps it doesn’t know, or doesn’t want to say, or is working out what to say in order to find a response that fits – and that it can execute. Still, red lines have been criss-crossed for months, and this morning we lept a few rungs higher up the ladder of escalation. The agonizing question of the next 24 hours - as Iran fashions its narrative of how this major humiliation came to be - is what remaining steps are there on this well-trodden ladder, and what is at its peak?"
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hamas political leader Haniyeh assassinated in Iran, plunging Middle East conflict into dangerous new phase","Hamas said its political leader has been killed in an overnight strike in the Iranian capital Tehran, a major development that throws the war between Israel and the militant group into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase.","Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Rob Picheta,Middle East,"CNN — Hamas said its political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in an overnight strike in the Iranian capital Tehran, a major development that throws the war between Israel and the militant group into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase. Haniyeh’s death is, both strategically and symbolically, a dramatic blow to Hamas, eliminating its most public figure who headed up the group’s political operations while living overseas. He is the second leader of an Iran-backed group reported to have been assassinated in the last day, following the killing of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander in Lebanon. In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of targeting Haniyeh and his bodyguard in a “strike” on the building in which he was staying in Tehran, where he had participated in Tuesday’s inauguration of the new Iranian president. Hamas officials said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain” and described the killing as a “grave escalation,” while Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing. At a news conference in Tehran later Wednesday, Hamas spokesperson and deputy head Khalil Al-Hayya said Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room where he was staying, and said Israel would “pay the price” for the “heinous crime.” Iranian state run media IRNA said the strike happened at around 2 a.m. local time (6:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday), involving an “airborne guided projectile.” Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was sworn in on Tuesday and Hamas released pictures the same day of Haniyeh meeting Iranian officials in Tehran. State-affiliated Fars said Haniyeh was staying in a residence in north Tehran. Israel’s military said it does not respond to reports in foreign media, though senior officials have previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leadership in response to the group’s October 7 attack on Israel. It later said it was “conducting a situational assessment.” In contrast, Israel did confirm it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr, whom it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Hezbollah later confirmed Shukr’s death. His assassination was the most serious Israeli escalation in its confrontation with the powerful Lebanese militant group since it restarted in earnest last October. Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, launched following the attacks led by the militant group on October 7, has sparked increasingly intense, near-daily ripples of conflict throughout the region. This week’s dual strikes, which came within several hours of each other, seemingly escalate that discord on multiple fronts, and will prompt renewed fears of an all-out war breaking out in the Middle East. In a televised address Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days, but did not mention the death of Haniyeh. “We’ll settle the score with anyone who harms us, anyone who massacres our children, anyone who murders our citizens,” Netanyahu said. In a bellicose speech, he said he did not “give in” to earlier calls to end the war in Gaza “and I am not giving in today.” He conceded “these are challenging days,” but stressed Israel is “ready for any scenario.” This week’s strikes may also dash any remaining hopes of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza being reached in the near future, amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the enclave. Haniyeh had played a leading role representing Hamas in months-long truce negotiations, which have repeatedly appeared to reach the cusp of a breakthrough, only to collapse at the last moment. In a statement after the strike, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum – which is campaigning to free the hostages still held in Gaza – said that “while (Israel’s) military operations over the past 10 months have achieved significant security gains, true achievement can only be realized with the release of all 115 hostages still in captivity.” It urged the Israeli government “to decisively advance negotiations.” Haniyeh photographed at the inauguration ceremony for the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Tuesday, hours before his death. Saman/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images Killing will ‘complicate’ ceasefire talks Haniyeh is the second Hamas senior leader to be killed since the war in Gaza began. In January, the group said the deputy head of its political bureau, Saleh Al Arouri, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Arouri was considered one of the founding members of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The impact of any single death in Hamas’ leadership structure is difficult to predict given the group’s vast and opaque network, and it has been able to weather the death of other key leaders before – including the slaying of its co-founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, killed weeks apart in 2004. But Haniyeh’s death leaves Hamas without its public political figurehead, and likely represents a major setback to its international operations. It would not be expected to dramatically impact its military effort, but his demise may carry symbolic weight throughout the organization.

Ronen Zvulun/Reuters/File Related article Netanyahu reverses on key Israeli concession in ceasefire talks He had taken a central role in hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, and earlier this spring said Hamas was willing to strike a deal – but added it would require Israel withdrawing from Gaza and a guarantee to cease fighting in the enclave permanently, demands that Israel has called “unacceptable.” A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN on Wednesday that Haniyeh’s death could “complicate mediation talks.” The source said Haniyeh – along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar – was a “key decision maker.” “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source added. Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt as recently as early July . Those talks now hang in the balance, despite some hope earlier this month that they were nearing a framework agreement. “How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a mediator in the talks, posted on X on Wednesday. Qatar’s capital, Doha, also hosts the main Hamas political bureau. “Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life,” Al-Thani wrote. Dual deaths raise fears of all-out war The killings of Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah’s Shukr in Beirut are significant in both their timing and location. Brigadier General (Res.) Assaf Orion, senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies think tank, said the two deaths “increase the likelihood of an axis response, adding Iran and other proxy attacks to the menu.” Iran has spent years investing in regional proxy groups, informally known as the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance – supplying them with money, weapons, and training as Tehran has sought to broaden its influence across the Middle East.

Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Khamenei said in a statement referring to Israel. “We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.” Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has brought that longstanding shadow war with Iran out into the open – and inflamed opinion globally. In a speech at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday, Iran’s ambassador to the UN blamed the United States for the death of Haniyeh, saying it could not have happened without US authorization and intelligence support. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the US was “not aware of or involved in” the killing. In calls with both the Jordanian and Qatari foreign ministers, Blinken said it was important to continue the ceasefire talks and to prevent “further escalation of the conflict,” according to State Department readouts. Meanwhile, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, while traveling in the Philippines, said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but if Israel were to be attacked the United States would help defend it. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military, said Haniyeh’s death was under investigation and results will be announced later Wednesday, according to Iranian state media. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Haniyeh’s killing calling it “a cowardly act and a dangerous development,” according to the WAFA news agency on Wednesday. “His Excellency called on the masses and forces of our people to unite, be patient and steadfast in the face of the Israeli occupation,” WAFA reported. A Hamas member for decades Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising. As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. By 2017 he had become chief of the group – and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the US soon after. Some Palestinians expressed shock and sadness at his death on Wednesday. “Ismail Haniyeh is the son of Gaza. He represents my entire people,” Ahmad Al Nims told a journalist working with CNN in Deir el-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip.

Another Gazan, Abu Yasser Hassoun, said the assassination had “struck” Palestinians “like a thunderbolt.” Palestinian analyst Mustafa Ibrahim told CNN that despite some disagreements, Haniyeh held a “special place among the Palestinians.” Over the years, Haniyeh has participated in peace talks with former US President Jimmy Carter , and met with other world leaders including the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian earlier this year. In April, Israeli air strikes killed three of Haniyeh’s sons and four of his grandchildren, according to Hamas. At the time, Haniyeh insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks. “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said. How Haniyeh spent the months after Oct. 7 After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis. CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track Haniyeh’s movements since October 7. Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt. The Hamas leader also spent two periods of time in Istanbul. He watched the October 7 attacks unfold in Hamas’ Istanbul offices. Video that circulated social media following the attacks show him celebrating after watching news reports of Hamas fighters returning to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment. He returned home to Doha in October after the attacks, and took another 14 day-trips there in April. While there in April, Haniyeh met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in addition to a number of Turkish politicians. Haniyeh’s body will be buried in Doha on Friday, after funerals are held for him in Tehran on Thursday.

Sign up here. CNN — The assassination of the political leader of Hamas has plunged the Middle East into fresh crisis and dented already slim hopes of an end to the war between Israel and the militant group that rules Gaza anytime soon. Hamas on Wednesday said Israel killed its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh , in Tehran, Iran, hours after Israel claimed a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s killing. Experts say the assassinations throw an ominous shadow on efforts to procure a ceasefire-hostage deal in Gaza, as well as hopes of de-escalation between Israel and its Iran-backed rivals in the region. Here’s what the killing of the Hamas and Hezbollah leaders means for the Gaza war and the region. Future of ceasefire talks unclear Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas had already hit repeated roadblocks before Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed on Tuesday night. As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement. All of that could now be thrown up in the air by his death.

Vahid Salemi/AP Related article What we know about the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s assassination could “complicate mediation talks,” as he had been “instrumental” to their progress. The source said Haniyeh was a “key decision-maker,” along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source said, adding that “at this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on ceasefire talks.” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas talks, wrote on X: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?” Qatar, which has helped release some of the Israeli hostages, sheltered the Hamas leader before his death, and the group’s political bureau has been based in its capital Doha since 2012. Questions will also be asked about the calculations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who many observers – including families of the hostages – have accused of deliberately stalling on negotiations and dragging out the war to safeguard his own political survival. “Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged ceasefire talks because ending the war will likely end his political career,” said Trita Parsi of the Quincy Institute, a US-based foreign policy think tank, in a post on X. “The assassination buys Netanyahu several weeks, if not months, in which there will be no serious expectation of a ceasefire deal.” People stand near a wall covered with pictures of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks, during a demonstration against the Israeli government, in the northern Israel city of Karmiel on July 25. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, noted that negotiations were already deadlocked even before the assassination of Haniyeh. Now, Baskin said, it is unclear how much longer Qatari and Egyptian mediators will allow themselves “to be played by Israel and Hamas,” adding that it may be time for the mediators to put a deal on the table and ask parties to “take it or leave it.” “And if they leave it, perhaps it’s time for them to leave the parties to themselves,” Baskin told CNN. A faltered negotiation process also extends the risk to the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The Hostages Families Forum said Wednesday that “true achievement” in the war can only be realized with the release of all hostages still in captivity, saying they “implore the Israeli government and global leaders to decisively advance negotiations.” “Time is of the essence,” the Forum said in a statement. “This is the time for a deal.” There are 111 hostages still in Gaza, including 39 believed to be dead, according to data from Netanyahu’s office. Their families have repeatedly slammed Netanyahu for failing to secure their release. No respite for the suffering in Gaza Without a ceasefire, Gaza’s besieged population will find no respite from the war, which has so far killed more than 39,000 people, according to the health ministry in the strip. Swathes of the territory have been flattened, and a humanitarian crisis is rapidly spiraling out of control. The war, which Israel launched in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, has also displaced almost all of Gaza’s population of 2 million, with 86% of the territory now under Israeli evacuation orders. Qatar’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said Haniyeh’s killing “would lead to the region sliding into a cycle of chaos and undermine the chances of peace.” Aftermath of an Israeli military strike on a building in Beirut's southern suburb on Tuesday. Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images Egypt, a key mediator in the conflict but whose ties with Israel have been strained since October 7, had condemned what it called “Israel’s dangerous policy of escalation” and warned against “the nonsense policy of assassination and violation of the sovereignty of states.” In a statement, Egypt said the two killings risk “igniting” confrontation in the region. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the United States was “not aware of or involved in” Haniyeh’s killing and that the Biden administration had been working “from day one” for a ceasefire to prevent the conflict from spreading to other regions. HA Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, said that unless there is an active effort to cool tensions in the region, “escalation will happen by, unfortunately, default.” “The United States has not been willing to use the leverage it actually has on Israel… in order to force Israel into a serious negotiation position,” Hellyer told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “This isn’t sustainable.” CNN’s Mostafa Salem contributed to this report."

The attack on Haniyeh came in the early hours of Wednesday morning, with Hamas pointing the finger at Israel – which has so far declined to comment. All eyes will now focus on two key questions. What happens to Gaza hostage and ceasefire negotiations, given Haniyeh headed up the group’s political operations from overseas and acted as a key interlocuter with international mediators? And will this strike inside Iran prove to be the catalyst for a potential full-blown regional war? Here’s what we know so far. What happened? Haniyeh had been in Tehran for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and was staying in a residence for veterans in the north of the city, state-affiliated news outlet Fars reported. Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room in which he was staying, Hamas spokesperson and deputy head Khalil Al-Hayya said at a news conference in Tehran. He said Israel would “pay the price” for the “heinous crime.” Earlier, Iranian state media IRNA reported that an “airborne guided projectile” had targeted the building at around 2 a.m. local time. IRNA said Haniyeh’s bodyguard was also killed, and that further investigations are underway to determine the details of the operation and the position from where the projectile was fired. Shortly afterward, Hamas decried what it called a “Zionist strike” and a “grave escalation” in its decades long conflict with Israel. One Hamas official said the group is “ready to pay various prices” and that the “moment of truth has come,” adding: “This assassination will not achieve the goals of the occupation and will not push Hamas to surrender.” When asked for comment, Israel’s military said it “doesn’t respond to reports in the foreign media.” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (right) meets Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh (left) at the president's office in Tehran, Iran, on July 30, 2024. Iranian Presidency Office/AP Who was Haniyeh? Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising. As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. He became political chief of Hamas in 2017. The following year, he was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States. Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization. During the war with Israel in Gaza he has taken a central role in hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. Earlier this spring, he said Hamas was willing to strike a deal – but it would require Israel withdrawing from Gaza and a guarantee to cease fighting in the enclave permanently, demands that Israel has called “unacceptable.” How does this impact ceasefire talks? Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt as recently as early July . Those talks now hang in the balance, despite some hope earlier this month that they were nearing a framework agreement. A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s death could “complicate mediation talks.” The source said Haniyeh was “instrumental” in getting certain breakthroughs in negotiations and – along with the Hamas military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar – was a “key decision maker.” “How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a mediator on the talks, posted on X on Wednesday. Qatar’s capital, Doha, also hosts the main Hamas political bureau. “Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life,” Al-Thani wrote. Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid said on Wednesday. In a statement after the strike, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government “to decisively advance negotiations,” to secure the release of the hostages who have been held in Gaza since the October 7 attack on Israel. “While military operations over the past 10 months have achieved significant security gains, true achievement can only be realized with the release of all 115 hostages still in captivity,” it said. “The deal proposed by the Israeli government and supported by President Biden represents the only viable path to secure their freedom, allowing the living to begin rehabilitation and the murdered to receive proper burial.” Video Ad Feedback The assassination of Hamas' political leader deepens fears of an all-out war in the Middle East 03:58 - Source: CNN What has the world said? Leaders from around the region have weighed in, with some condemning the killing and voicing alarm about the potential fallout. Palestinian leaders, including the Palestinian president and prime minister – who come from factions that have deep historical rivalries with Hamas – have condemned the killing and called for Palestinian “national unity.” The White House has seen the reports of Haniyeh’s killing, a spokesperson said, but declined to immediately comment further. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but that the US would help defend Israel if it were attacked. Leaders from Russia and Turkey have both decried the assassination, warning it would lead to larger conflicts in the region. Other Iran-backed militant groups have also voiced sympathy – including Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. Two reported killings, in quick succession News of Haniyeh’s killing came just hours after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon.

If true, Shukr would be the most high-ranking Hezbollah official to have been assassinated since 2016 when Mustafa Badreddine, the group’s top commander at the time, was killed in Syria. Whatever the fate of Shukr, Wednesday’s strike marked the most serious Israeli escalation since confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel began on October 8.

Hamas and Iranian state media said Wednesday that the 62-year-old had been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran . Hamas claimed Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli “strike” on his residence, while the Israeli military declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Haniyeh’s death strikes a significant blow to Hamas at a time when tensions are flaring across the Middle East over the devastating war in Gaza, and raises fraught questions about the future of negotiations between Israel and Hamas. As Hamas’s political leader, he was a key interlocutor with international mediators during stalled hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, following the group’s October 7 attack on Israel. Haniyeh was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising against Israel’s occupation in Gaza and the West Bank. His parents were refugees expelled from Askalan, which later became known as the Israeli city Ashkelon. He was imprisoned several times in Israel for his participation in the uprising, before being deported and returning to Gaza – where he steadily climbed Hamas ranks in the following decade. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (right) meets Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh (left) at the president's office in Tehran, Iran, on July 30, 2024. Iranian Presidency Office/AP Haniyeh was appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004 after the deaths of Hamas’ founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who were killed in Israeli strikes just weeks apart. After Hamas won elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006, Haniyeh became prime minister of the Palestinian Authority (PA) government, but it was short lived. He was dismissed after a year in office by PA President Mahmoud Abbas and remains the only PA prime minister to have taken office after securing a mandate in popular elections. A year later, Hamas seized Gaza after a short-lived, but bloody conflict with the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority, Fatah. Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the territory shortly after that, alongside Egypt. Though regarded as Hamas’s leader in Gaza for many years, Haniyeh did not become the group’s overall political leader until 2017, when he took over from Khaled Meshaal who had led Hamas in exile since 2004. A year later, Haniyeh was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States – which came during a period of tension between Washington and the Palestinians due to the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision made by the then-US President Donald Trump. Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization. He was photographed meeting Iran’s news President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran on Tuesday. Ceasefire and hostage release talks Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 saw at least 1,500 Hamas fighters pour across the border into Israel, in an assault that killed at least 1,200, and some 200 others taken hostage. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health there, and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe in the densely crowded strip. In the months since, Haniyeh had been a key figure participating in international negotiations over the conflict, including the release of hostages still in Gaza. He had shown willingness to reach an agreement if Israel withdrew from Gaza – saying in May that the group was “still keen” to strike a deal with mediators, but that any proposal would have to cease fighting in the enclave permanently.

As recently as early July , Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement. Given his role in negotiations, Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid on Wednesday.

            • Iran: The Iranian foreign minister has warned there are “no red lines” in defending the country’s interests. Iran has informed the US it will retaliate against any new attack by Israel, a source in Tehran said. An Israeli cabinet meeting will be held Sunday as its leaders weigh a response to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.
     
            • Gaza: At least 22 people have been killed by Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza, emergency responders said Saturday. It comes as Israel is intensifying its military operations in the area, issuing evacuation orders and blocking food supplies. A UN inquiry has accused Israel of war crimes during its year-long war against Hamas in Gaza, with Palestinians living in desperate conditions.
     
            • Lebanon: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has told the UN to get its peacekeepers out of Lebanon, warning they are “in harm’s way.” The injury of five UNIFIL staff by Israeli fire has drawn international condemnation. The Israeli military said Hezbollah fired over 300 projectiles into Israel from Lebanon on Saturday. Meanwhile,  Israel has expanded evacuation warnings to over a dozen more villages in southern Lebanon — placing a quarter of Lebanese territory under evacuation orders. Lebanon’s prime minister made another push for a ceasefire.
     
            Some 300 people have been killed in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza since the beginning of the latest Israeli ground operation in the area nine days ago, the Gaza Government Media Office said Sunday.
     
            The office said heavy fighting meant emergency workers had not yet been able to recover dozens of those who have been killed in the area, leaving decomposing bodies in the streets and buildings.
     
            The Israeli military reinvaded Jabalya earlier this month after saying there were signs of “the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area.” This is the third time Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has launched a ground operation in the Jabalya camp.
     
            Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, the closest medical facility to Jabalya, said medical teams in the hospital were overwhelmed by the high number of casualties that keep arriving amid the heavy fighting.
     
            Abu Safiya said the Jabalya camp was now “completely besieged,” which made it impossible to bring in health supplies, food and the specialized medical teams that are so desperately needed there.
     
            He said the hospital currently has enough fuel for 10 days, after a delivery on Saturday. That delivery was delayed by Israel for three days, putting the hospital dangerously close to running out of electricity.
     
            The IDF said it asked people in the area to evacuate, although many locals have told CNN it was too dangerous to try to leave.
     
            Three mosques in southern Lebanon were hit by Israeli fire, leaving them partly or fully destroyed, amid cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.
     
            Videos posted on social media and geolocated by CNN showed a pile of rubble where the Kfar Tebnit mosque minaret once stood. Although the mosque’s main building was left standing, it exhibited some damage as well.
     
            Lebanese state news agency NNA said damage to the mosque was caused by an Israeli airstrike, which also killed four people and “caused serious damage to the surrounding houses and vehicles.”
     
            Another video, also geolocated by CNN, showed the mosque in Dhohaira seemingly blown up by Israeli forces.
     
            NNA reported a third mosque had been damaged in Nabatiyeh, when Israeli aircraft struck the city market repeatedly overnight.
     
            The Lebanese Red Cross said its team responded to “a major airstrike” in Nabatiyeh Saturday night. “Severe fires are preventing us from reaching the targeted area,” the group said on X on Saturday, later adding search and rescue efforts were underway through the night.
     
            The Lebanese Ministry of Health said in a preliminary count that at least eight people had been injured.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on these incidents but has yet to hear back.
     
            At least two Israeli soldiers were severely injured during combat operations in southern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Sunday.
     
            The two were among multiple casualties suffered by the Israeli military in at least two separate incidents. The IDF wouldn’t reveal the exact number but said “multiple soldiers” had been injured.
     
            The Galilee Medical Center said in a statement that seventeen Israeli soldiers injured in fighting in southern Lebanon had been treated at the facility since Sunday morning.
     
        “Dr. Tzvi Shaleg, the deputy director of the medical center, reported that four of them are classified as in moderate condition, while the rest are in light condition (most suffering from shrapnel injuries),” a spokesperson for the hospital told CNN.
     
 
            Iran has “no red lines” in defending its interests, the country’s Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi said Sunday.
     
            “While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests,” Araghchi said in a social media post, also criticizing US arms deliveries to Israel.
     
Key context: His comments come as Iran braces for Israel’s response to its missile attack earlier this month.
     
            Iran has been engaging with countries in the Middle East to determine whether the scale of Israel’s response could be reduced, sources familiar with the matter told CNN earlier this week.
     
            The US has been consulting with Israel and officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned the UN that UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in Lebanon are in “harm’s way,” calling on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to get them out.
     
        “I want to address the UN Secretary-General directly from here: It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and combat zones,” Netanyahu said in a video statement Sunday.
     
 
            The Israeli prime minister went on to say the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had asked UNIFIL to redeploy multiple times but said those requests had been refused. Netanyahu claimed the peacekeepers’ presence was “aimed at providing a human shield for Hezbollah.”
     
            “Your refusal to evacuate UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah. This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers,” Netanyahu added.
     
            The Israeli prime minister also said he regretted that some UN peacekeepers had been injured.
     
            “We regret the harm to UNIFIL soldiers and are doing everything we can to prevent such harm. But the simple and necessary way to ensure this is to remove them from the danger zone,” he said. “It should be done right now, immediately.”
     
Remember: Five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured by Israeli fire in southern Lebanon in just two days. The injuries to UN troops have drawn international condemnation.
     
            Israel’s military told CNN it expresses “deep concern” after two UN peacekeepers were injured in southern Lebanon on Friday.
     
            A peacekeeper from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was hit by gunfire at its headquarters in the city of Naqoura on Friday, according to a statement released by UNIFIL on Saturday.
     
            “He underwent surgery at our Naqoura hospital to remove the bullet and is currently stable. We do not yet know the origin of the fire,” UNIFIL said.
     
            Asked by CNN about gunfire that caused the injury to a peacekeeper, Nadav Shoshani, international spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement that two peacekeepers were “inadvertently hurt during IDF combat against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.”
     
        “The IDF expresses deep concern over incidents of this kind and is currently conducting a thorough review at the highest levels of command to determine the details,” he said.
     
 
            Shoshani added that the IDF is “currently conducting a thorough review at the highest levels of command to determine the details.”
     
Remember:  The peacekeeper hit by gunfire Friday was the fifth member of the UN force hurt in southern Lebanon in just two days.
     
            The injuries to UN troops have drawn international condemnation. On Saturday, 40 countries whose soldiers serve as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon said in a joint statement they “strongly condemn” recent attacks on peacekeepers.
     
            Co-signatories of the statement included the UK, France, India, Germany and Spain.
     
            The Israeli military said it had captured a Hezbollah fighter while storming one of the group’s tunnels and hideouts in southern Lebanon.
     
            “The forces surrounded the building, examined the tunnel shaft, and located an underground complex about 7 meters deep and 50 meters of space where a Hezbollah terrorist was entrenched, along with weaponry and equipment for long-term stay,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
     
            Video shared by the IDF showed a man, climbing up a ladder and exiting a tunnel shaft in his underwear and sneakers. He can be seen holding his hands up as he surrenders to Israeli soldiers.
     
            In the video, the alleged fighter is blurred, presumably to conceal his identity. The Geneva Conventions require prisoners of war to be protected against “public curiosity.”
     
            The IDF said that after surrendering, the Hezbollah fighter was interrogated, arrested and transferred to “a detention facility for further investigation within the country.”
     
            In a response to CNN, a Hezbollah official denied any of its fighters or members had been captured. “Not true,” the official said in response to the Israeli military statement posted on X.

            Four Lebanese Red Cross volunteers were injured by a double Israeli airstrike on a house in Srebbine, southern Lebanon, on Sunday morning, the organization said.
     
            The volunteers had been dispatched to the scene after the initial strike and in coordination with UNIFIL.
     
        “As the team was searching for casualties to rescue, the house was hit for a second time resulting in concussions to the volunteers and damage to the two ambulances,” the Red Cross said.
     
 
            The Red Cross said the volunteers were treated in a Lebanese hospital and are “in good condition.”
     
            “Volunteers should be protected at all times while attempting to rescue casualties,” it added.
     
            CNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces about the incident but has yet to hear back.
     
            Israel’s widening military operations in Gaza and Lebanon – and looming response to Iran’s missile attack – are testament to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s need for political survival, a former Israeli diplomat told CNN.
     
            “Netanyahu does not want to end the war,” Israel’s former consul general to New York Alon Pinkas told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade.
     
            “He wanted to extend, to prolong the war in order to create … a war-like atmosphere which is important to him politically and expedient to him politically,” said Pinkas, who was speaking from Tel Aviv.
     
            Netanyahu’s self-styled image as “Mister Security” seemed irrevocably shattered by the October 7 Hamas attack, but he has since staged a turnaround.
     
            The war to eliminate Hamas in Gaza remains largely popular in Israel, but it has raised complex questions around long-term occupation, relations with Palestinians, and conflict with Israel’s neighbors including Iran-backed proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s war goals have expanded to target Hezbollah, and Netanyahu’s cabinet is weighing its response to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.
     
            “I don’t see him ending the war,” Pinkas said, citing Netanyahu’s repeated rejection of US President Joe Biden’s post-war Gaza plans and refusal to make any ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
     
        “He doesn’t even mention the hostages anymore, there are still 100 hostages in Gaza,” he said.
     
 
            Only a ceasefire in Gaza – where Pinkas believes Israel has already achieved its war goals – could bring about a de-escalation in Lebanon, yet the prime minister has “legitimately but wrongly refused to see that logic.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a cabinet meeting on Sunday, an Israeli official tells CNN, as the country’s leaders weigh their response to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.
     
            The wider region is already mired in conflict. Israel has intensified its military operations in Gaza, issuing evacuation orders and blocking food supplies to the impoverished enclave.
     
            Tensions continue to simmer along the Israel-Lebanon border, with dozens of countries condemning attacks on United Nations peacekeepers. A quarter of Lebanese territory is under evacuation orders amid Israeli airstrikes and a ground incursion, while the country’s prime minister made another push for a ceasefire on Saturday.
     
Here’s what to know:
 
            Forty countries whose soldiers serve as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon say they “strongly condemn” recent attacks on peacekeepers, in a joint statement released on Saturday.
     
            The statement was posted on X by Poland’s mission to the UN, after the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reported a fifth member of the peacekeeping force was injured in southern Lebanon on Friday.
     
            “Such actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated,” the statement said, adding: “We urge the parties of the conflict to respect UNIFIL’s presence, which entails the obligation to guarantee the safety and security of its personnel at all times.”
     
            Co-signatories of the statement include the UK, France, India, Germany and Spain.
     
            Since Thursday, UNIFIL reported that two peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli tank fired toward its observation tower in Naqoura, causing it to collapse. On Friday UNIFIL said two more were hurt after two explosions near the observation tower.
     
            Sri Lanka and Indonesia, whose nationals were among the injured, condemned the incidents.
     
            On Friday a fifth peacekeeper was hit by gunfire at its headquarters in Naqoura due to ongoing military activity nearby, according to a UNIFIL statement released on Saturday.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday expressed “deep concern” regarding reports of Israeli forces firing on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, during a conversation with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, according to the Pentagon.
     
            Austin “strongly emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and security of UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) forces” and urged Israel to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway “as soon as feasible,” the readout said.
     
            Austin also raised the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stressed “steps must be taken to address it.”
     
            The Ziv hospital in northern Israel is on high alert. Non-urgent operations are on hold, staff have been asked to consider donating blood when needed, and all patients – including newborns in the maternity unit – have been moved underground.
     
            The expectation here is clear: If Israel ends up sending more troops to southern Lebanon, it could get bloody.
     
            “We have been in a war situation for the past year, but after the army entered into Lebanon, our services and all of the staff are ready for, unfortunately, the next wave of casualties,” the hospital’s director, Salman Zarka, told CNN.
     
            Ziv Medical Center is the only hospital in the area and the closest to Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, as well as the occupied Golan Heights. The hospital in Safed has been receiving people injured in cross-border fire for months, including children hurt in the deadly attack on Majdal Shams in July.
     
            “When you have combat on the ground, usually you have more wounded and, unfortunately, dead soldiers. I hope it will not happen, (but) we have to be ready,” Zarka, an IDF reservist and a former commander of the IDF’s Medical Services Center, added.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a cabinet meeting on Sunday, an Israeli official tells CNN.
     
            Exactly when and where the meeting will be held remains unclear.
     
            On Friday, a source told CNN the cabinet had discussed how to respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack but had not reached a decision on how to proceed.
     
            Iran has informed the United States and some countries in the Middle East that it will retaliate against any new attack by Israel, a source in Tehran with knowledge of the diplomatic discussions told CNN on Saturday.
     
            The Israeli military said 320 projectiles fired by Hezbollah crossed into Israel over Yom Kippur weekend, which began around 6 p.m. local time on Friday.
     
            On Saturday, Hezbollah said it continued to fire rockets into Israel, targeting what it said was a “gathering of Israeli enemy forces” in villages just south of the border.
     
            Israeli authorities said three men suffered mild shrapnel injuries following rocket launches from Lebanon, many of which Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for. The men, ages 48, 30, and 27, were injured in the town of Jadeida-Machar.
     
            Nearly half of the primary health care centers in Lebanon’s conflict areas are now closed amid escalating violence, according to World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
     
            Of the 207 centers in conflict areas, 100 are now closed, Ghebreyesus posted on X on Saturday. Five hospitals have shut following structural damage from attacks.
     
            “The attacks on health workers and facilities, which have caused almost 100 deaths, must stop. The number of people injured is increasing. The health system is struggling to cope due to limited human and resource capacity,” the WHO director general said.
     
            Over the past 12 months, 90% of children in Gaza have suffered from “food poverty,” according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS).
     
            “Human suffering should never be normalized,” the group posted to X on Saturday. “We must work towards ending this ongoing crisis.”
     
            The World Food Programme (WFP) on Friday said no food has entered northern Gaza since the start of October, putting 1 million people at risk of going hungry.
     
            On Wednesday, the WFP said in a report that the aid entering the strip has plummeted to its lowest level in months, forcing the organization to stop the distribution of food parcels in October. CNN had reached out to Israeli authorities and the military for comment on the lack of food entering northern Gaza since the beginning of the month but has not heard back.
     
Current operation in the north: The Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation in northern Gaza, coming just weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be mulling a plan to besiege the area to starve Hamas and force it to release hostages. Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired Gen. Giora Eiland. But the operation currently underway bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
     
            The Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation in northern Gaza, issuing evacuation orders and blocking food supplies. The intensifying military action comes just weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be mulling a plan to besiege the area to starve Hamas and force it to release hostages.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) this week launched the operation following intelligence that it said showed “the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.”
     
            In practice, the renewed offensive has been far more widespread than the Jabalya refugee camp.
 
            Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired general Giora Eiland. But the current operation bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
     
            A former senior military official aware of the Israeli government and security leadership’s thinking – though not directly involved in decision-making – told CNN that the cabinet had adopted “a version of” Eiland’s proposal, which has come to be known as “The General’s Plan.” Eiland told CNN the claim was “quite true” but said there were significant differences between his proposal and what was being implemented on the ground.
     
            The operation comes at a time when the Israeli government is known to be considering several plans to reset the war in Gaza.

            Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
     
            Forty countries whose soldiers serve as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon say they “strongly condemn” recent attacks on peacekeepers, in a joint statement released on Saturday.

            Austin also raised the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stressed “steps must be taken to address it.”
     
            At least 15 people were killed in Israeli strikes on three Lebanese towns on Saturday, according to a CNN tally of numbers from Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            In northern Lebanon, a strike in Maaysra killed at least nine people and another in Deir Billa killed two, according to the ministry. Meanwhile in Barja, 20 miles south of Beirut, four people were killed.
     
            The Israeli military told CNN it wasn’t aware of any strikes Saturday in those locations. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) if there were strikes in the vicinity of those towns.
     
            The Lebanese state news agency NNA reported that Israeli strikes had also hit Nabatieh in southern Lebanon and the northern and central parts of the Bekaa region. The IDF has not yet responded to a CNN request for comment on the reported strikes in these areas. It has previously struck Nabatieh and Bekaa, saying it was eliminating Hezbollah targets.
     
            According to state media, Tel Chiha Hospital in the Bekaa governorate sustained some damage and a market was hit in Nabatieh. Lebanon’s health ministry said at least eight people were injured in Nabatieh.
     
            The Lebanese Red Cross said it was conducting search and rescue operations in Nabatieh.
     
            “Severe fires are preventing us from reaching the targeted area,” the group said in a post on X.
     
            Lebanese state media also reported that strikes hit Rayaq in central Bekaa, which is home to a Lebanese military base and military airport. According to NNA, homes, commercial establishments, a university and hospitals were damaged in Bekaa.
     
            The Israeli military said 320 projectiles fired by Hezbollah crossed into Israel over Yom Kippur weekend, which began around 6 p.m. local time on Friday.

Report about October 7 attack:
 
            Hamas plotted the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel for more than two years and tried to persuade Iran and Hezbollah to participate, a report in The New York Times has claimed, citing what it said were minutes of secret Hamas meetings found on a computer and seized by the Israeli military in Gaza in January.
     
            According to the Times, whose claims have been vigorously denied by Iran and Hezbollah, Hamas had been avoiding major escalations with Israel since 2021 to lull its leaders into a false sense of security and initially planned to attack in the fall of 2022, but delayed its move as it tried to persuade Iran and Hezbollah to take part.
     
            The Times cites the minutes as showing that a top Hamas official met senior Iranian commander Mohammed Said Izadi, who was based in Lebanon in July 2023, to request help striking sensitive Israeli sites, and Izadi is said to have responded that Iran and Hezbollah were supportive in principle, but needed more time to “prepare the environment.”
     
            Iran’s Mission to the United Nations has denied the claims and suggested the minutes cited by the Times were fabricated.
     
        In a statement to CNN, it said: “While Doha-stationed Hamas officials have themselves stated that they, too, had no prior knowledge of the operation and that all the planning, decision-making, and directing were solely executed by Hamas’s military wing based in Gaza, any claim attempting to link it to Iran or Hezbollah – either partially or wholly – is devoid of credence and comes from fabricated documents.”
     
 
            A Hezbollah spokesperson told CNN on Saturday: “As the martyred secretary general of Hezbollah (Hassan Nasrallah) said, Hezbollah did not know about the toufan Al Aqsa operation executed by Hamas on the 7th of October.”
     
            CNN has also reached out to Hamas and the Israeli military and Israeli prime minister’s office for comment. The Israeli military declined to comment to The New York Times, while neither Hamas nor Hezbollah responded to the newspaper’s requests for comment.

            Hezbollah said it launched a drone attack on the outskirts of Tel Aviv on Friday.
     
            In a statement Saturday, the Iran-backed group said it “launched an aerial attack with a swarm of assault drones.”
     
            Israel’s military said Friday it had detected two aircraft in central Israel crossing from Lebanon.
     
            The military said it intercepted one of the aircraft but did not specify what happened to the second. The Israel Defense Forces said a nursing home building in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, was damaged but there were no casualties.

            On Saturday, Hezbollah said it continued to fire rockets into Israel, targeting what it said was a “gathering of Israeli enemy forces” in villages just south of the border.
     
            Israeli authorities said three men suffered mild shrapnel injuries following rocket launches from Lebanon, many of which Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for. The men, ages 48, 30, and 27, were injured in the town of Jadeida-Machar.
     
Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that the IDF said over 300 projectiles crossed into Israeli territory, not that all of them were intercepted.
 
            Nearly half of the primary health care centers in Lebanon’s conflict areas are now closed amid escalating violence, according to World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
     
            Of the 207 centers in conflict areas, 100 are now closed, Ghebreyesus posted on X on Saturday. Five hospitals have shut following structural damage from attacks.
     
        “The attacks on health workers and facilities, which have caused almost 100 deaths, must stop. The number of people injured is increasing. The health system is struggling to cope due to limited human and resource capacity,” the WHO director general said.
     
 
            Israeli strikes on two Lebanese towns killed at least nine people, including one town with a predominantly Sunni population, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            Four people were killed and 14 injured in an Israeli airstrike on Barja, a predominantly Sunni town some 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Beirut, according to Lebanese health authorities.
     
            The strike in Barja stands out because Israel has been striking targets in predominantly Shia areas where Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group, tends to have stronger support.
     
            Five people were killed and 14 were also wounded in the town of Maaysra in northern Lebanon on Saturday, the ministry said. This is the second time Maaysra has been hit in the last few weeks.
     
            Another town in northern Lebanon, Deir Billa, was hit for the first time. The health ministry has not yet released casualty numbers for that strike.
     
Death toll: More than 1,500 people have been killed and some 8,000 injured in strikes in Lebanon since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements.
     
            Over the past 12 months, 90% of children in Gaza have suffered from “food poverty,” according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS).
     
        “Human suffering should never be normalized,” the group posted to X on Saturday. “We must work towards ending this ongoing crisis.”
     
 
            The World Food Programme (WFP) on Friday said no food has entered northern Gaza since the start of October, putting 1 million people at risk of going hungry.
     
            On Wednesday, the WFP said in a report that the aid entering the strip has plummeted to its lowest level in months, forcing the organization to stop the distribution of food parcels in October. CNN had reached out to Israeli authorities and the military for comment on the lack of food entering northern Gaza since the beginning of the month but has not heard back.
     
Current operation in the north: The Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation in northern Gaza, coming just weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be mulling a plan to besiege the area to starve Hamas and force it to release hostages. Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired Gen. Giora Eiland. But the operation currently underway bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
     
            Another peacekeeper from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was injured in southern Lebanon on Friday evening, UNIFIL said in a statement on Saturday.
     
            UNIFIL said the peacekeeper was hit by gunfire at its headquarters in the city of Naqoura due to ongoing military activity nearby.
     
        “He underwent surgery at our Naqoura hospital to remove the bullet and is currently stable. We do not yet know the origin of the fire,” the force said.
     
 
            The peacekeeper was the fifth member of the UN force hurt in southern Lebanon in just two days.
     
            UNIFIL said two peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli Merkava tank fired toward its observation tower in Naqoura on Thursday, causing it to collapse.
     
            On Friday, two more were hurt after two explosions occurred close to the observation tower in Naqoura.
     
            Separately, UNIFIL said its building in a UN position in Ramyah, Lebanon, “sustained significant damage due to explosions from nearby shelling” on Friday.
     
Condemnation from other countries: A number of nations whose citizens serve in the peacekeeping force criticized Israel for the incidents. Italy and France have summoned their Israeli ambassadors, and the head of Ireland’s armed forces, Lt. Gen. Sean Clancy, claimed the gunfire that hit the UNIFIL position on Friday seemed “deliberate,” given the circumstances. Sri Lanka and Indonesia, whose nationals were among the injured, also condemned the incidents.
     
            Fuel has finally been delivered to the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza on Saturday, after days of warning that it would run out of energy needed to keep life-saving equipment running.
     
            Fares Afana, who heads emergency services in northern Gaza, said a fuel truck had entered the hospital complex and fuel was being pumped in.
     
            Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, the director of the hospital, told CNN Friday that patients would die if Israel refused to allow fuel to enter the area, saying there had been “many attempts to bring fuel in, but the Israeli military have prevented that.”
     
            Responding on Saturday to CNN’s questions about the allegation that it is preventing fuel from entering the area, the Israel Defense Forces said: “In the last three days, a medical convoy was scheduled to transfer patients from Kamal Adwan Hospital to Gaza City. For security reasons, the convoy had to be canceled.”
     
            “The convoy arrived at the hospital today on the 12th of October with fuel supply for the hospital,” it added.
     
            The European Union joined the United Nations, the United States and others in criticizing Israel for attempting to ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in Israel and East Jerusalem.
     
            A bill calling for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to be banned from operating in Israel and for Israel to stop cooperating with the agency is making its way through the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
     
            The EU said the bill would prevent “all UNRWA’s operations in Israel and East Jerusalem, destroy UNRWA’s life-saving operations in Gaza, seriously hamper provision of health, education and social services in the West Bank, and revoke UNRWA’s diplomatic privileges and immunities.”
     
Remember: Israel has been trying to dismantle the agency for months after it accused 12 UNRWA staffers of being involved in the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.
     
            The allegations initially prompted 16 countries to suspend their funding of the agency. However, most have since reinstated their funding.
     
            A UN investigation found that nine UNRWA employees “may have” been involved in the October 7 attacks and no longer work at the agency. UNRWA has 14,000 staff members in Gaza.
     
            The agency was already forced to close its East Jerusalem headquarters after the compound became the target of attacks by Israeli protesters. Earlier this week, Israeli media reported a decision by the Israeli Land Authority to confiscate the land and turn it into a housing complex.
     
            The Iranian government has been engaging in urgent diplomacy with countries in the Middle East to determine whether they can reduce the scale of any potential Israeli attack, a source told CNN. Iran has been expecting a response from Tel Aviv after launching a ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this month.
     
            Elsewhere, Israel has ramped up its operations in northern Gaza, where an 11-hour-old newborn girl was injured in a strike on Friday. At least 22 people have been killed by Israeli bombardment in the city of Jabalya in northern Gaza, emergency responders said.
     
Below are the latest updates: 
 
            Iranians donated gold to a fundraiser for Hezbollah and Lebanon at a mosque in Tehran on Saturday, CNN’s team on the ground witnessed.
     
            The slogan for the fundraiser is: “Golden Empathy, Iranian women and mothers donate gold in support of Lebanon.”
     
            Women were seen donating pieces of jewelery to a stand at the mosque which was decorated with posters of the late Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah as well as Iranian and Hezbollah flags. CNN witnessed a box with dozens of pieces of gold jewelery.
     
Remember: The donations come as Iran says their support for Hezbollah and Lebanon will continue.
     
            Iran’s capital Tehran has been plastered with billboards and posters depicting Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut, Lebanon, last month. The posters are a sign of the unwavering support of the Islamic Republic’s leadership for Hezbollah in the wake of the Nasrallah killing and as the group struggles under Israeli military pressure.
     
            Iran is bracing for a possible Israeli response to its October 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel and Tehran’s political leadership has threatened a “crushing response,” if Israel hits targets inside Iran.
     
            Iran’s government has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with countries in the Middle East to gauge whether they can reduce the scale of Israel’s response and – if that fails – help protect Tehran, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            Iran has informed the United States and some countries in the Middle East that it will retaliate against any new attack by Israel, “contrary to some false news,” a source in Tehran with knowledge of the diplomatic discussions told CNN on Saturday.
     
Key context: Iran’s government has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with countries in the Middle East to gauge whether they can reduce the scale of Israel’s response to its missile attack earlier this month and – if that fails – help protect Tehran, sources familiar with the matter told CNN earlier.
     
            The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months, telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.”
     
            The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, have also expressed concern to the US about a potential attack on Iranian oil facilities, which could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN.
     
            Israel’s security cabinet has not yet reached a decision on how to proceed, an Israeli official told CNN on Friday.
     
CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler and Alex Marquardt contributed to this post. 
 
            Hezbollah said it continued to fire rockets into Israel on Saturday, targeting what it said was a “gathering of Israeli enemy forces” in villages just south of the border.
     
            Sirens alerting people to an imminent attack sounded in different locations across northern Israel on Saturday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said later that it identified around 30 projectiles crossing from Lebanon into the Upper Galilee area and two that were fired towards northeastern areas of Israel.
     
        “Some of the projectiles were intercepted. Fallen projectiles were identified in the area,” the IDF said.
     
 
            The IDF also said the Israeli Air Force intercepted two drones that were approaching Israeli territory from Lebanon, before they crossed the border.
     
            Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati made yet another push for a ceasefire on Saturday, speaking first to the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein, followed by the president of the Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.
     
            Mikati discussed the ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire amid escalating tensions in the region, Lebanon’s state National News Agency (NNA) said.
     
            Meeting Ghalibaf in Beirut, Mikati reiterated that the Lebanese government’s priority is “working towards a ceasefire, halting Israeli aggression, and ensuring the security and safety of Lebanon and its people,” NNA reported.
     
            Speaking to Hochstein by phone, Mikati focused on ways to halt “military confrontations” and move forward with a comprehensive political solution based on the 2006 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for a permanent ceasefire and an end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.
     
What else does the resolution say? It stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw north of the Litani River in Lebanon and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area.
     
            The Israeli military has expanded its evacuation warnings to residents of 19 more villages in southern Lebanon, urging them to move further north into the country.
     
            People living in the villages, located within 18 miles (30 kilometers) of the Israeli border, have been advised to relocate about 31 miles (50 kilometers) north.
     
            “You must immediately move to the north of the Awali River. Save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately,” said Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Forces Arabic spokesperson, reiterating his previous advice in a message posted on X on Saturday.
     
Some context: This latest warning is part of a broader series of Israeli evacuation directives issued over the past week, now affecting a total of 136 villages. 
 
            Overall, a quarter of Lebanon’s territory has been placed under evacuation orders by Israel, with more than 1.2 million people now displaced, according to the United Nations.
     
            Israel has reiterated its threat to target any emergency response vehicles in Lebanon if they are shown to be transporting armed fighters.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Saturday that Hezbollah operatives have “increased their misuse of emergency vehicles” in recent days, adding that the vehicles had also been used to transport ammunition.
     
        “Any vehicle shown to contain armed operatives with the intent to carry out terrorism, regardless of the type of vehicle, is a military target,” the IDF statement said.
     
 
            The warning, released in both English and Arabic, came one week after a similar warning on October 5 by the IDF Arabic language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee.
     
            Health workers in Lebanon have frequently been the victims of attacks since Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah.
     
            On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said that since September 16 when the most recent escalation began, 65 health workers had been killed and 40 injured in Lebanon.
     
            In addition, 96 primary health care centers and health facilities had been forced to close in the south of the country.
     
Some context: Health and aid workers have been frequent casualties of Israeli bombardment during the yearlong war in Gaza. In February, a CNN analysis found evidence of repeated attacks on and in the vicinity of medical facilities in Gaza despite the presence of doctors, patients, and civilians.
     
            An 11-hour-old baby girl suffered a head wound on Friday when a strike hit her house just moments after she was brought home from the hospital where she was born, the chief of emergency services in northern Gaza, Fares Afana, told CNN.
     
            The strike killed the newborn girl’s father and uncle and injured her mother and grandmother, Afana said. A video from the hospital where the family was treated for injuries shows the tiny baby getting stitches to a wound at the bottom of her neck.
     
            The mother of the newborn baby was in critical condition at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, where she was being treated in the intensive care unit, the hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya told CNN on Saturday. The baby girl was stable and “next to her mother,” the doctor added.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces told CNN they “were not aware” of a strike in the area at the time the witnesses described, but said they would need exact coordinates to be certain.
     
            The baby’s grandfather said the girl — who was not yet named — was born at 1 a.m. on Friday and was being brought home by her parents when the building was struck, according to a video that shows him in an ambulance, accompanying his wife who was also injured in the strike.
     
        “We have no fighters or anything like that. I say to the world: look at us. Stop the war. Stop the war. I swear to God, we are peaceful. We are peaceful. We are peaceful. My children are peaceful. They even used to work inside Israel. We do not do anything wrong,” the grandfather said.
     
 
            The Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation in northern Gaza, issuing evacuation orders and blocking food supplies. The intensifying military action comes just weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be mulling a plan to besiege the area to starve Hamas and force it to release hostages.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) this week launched the operation following intelligence that it said showed “the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.”
     
            In practice, the renewed offensive has been far more widespread than the Jabalya refugee camp.
 
            Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired general Giora Eiland. But the current operation bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
     
            A former senior military official aware of the Israeli government and security leadership’s thinking – though not directly involved in decision-making – told CNN that the cabinet had adopted “a version of” Eiland’s proposal, which has come to be known as “The General’s Plan.” Eiland told CNN the claim was “quite true” but said there were significant differences between his proposal and what was being implemented on the ground.
     
            The operation comes at a time when the Israeli government is known to be considering several plans to reset the war in Gaza.

            At least 22 people were killed by Israeli bombardment on the city of Jabalya in northern Gaza, according to emergency responders on Saturday.
     
            The bodies were transferred to Al-Ahli Baptist hospital, according to the head of emergency services in northern Gaza, Fares Afana.
     
            Afana said that in addition to those killed, there were also injuries and “a number of missing still under the rubble.”
     
            CNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
     
            The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported multiple airstrikes had struck a densely populated neighborhood in Jabalya overnight completely destroying multiple houses.
     
            Wafa reported at least 30 injured and 14 missing, citing emergency responders.
     
            Rescue efforts are still underway.
     
            The Jabalya refugee camp was pounded by more strikes on Saturday, where explosions in the area have not stopped, the head of the emergency services in northern Gaza said.
     
            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have ordered more residents of Jabalya and Nazla, just north of Gaza City, to move south ahead of planned military operations on Saturday. At the same time, the Ministry of Interior in Gaza called on citizens not to leave their homes in the areas that the Israeli army warned about this morning.

            The Ziv hospital in northern Israel is on high alert. Non-urgent operations are on hold, staff have been asked to consider donating blood when needed, and all patients – including newborns in the maternity unit – have been moved underground.
     
            The expectation here is clear: If Israel ends up sending more troops to southern Lebanon, it could get bloody.
     
            “We have been in a war situation for the past year, but after the army entered into Lebanon, our services and all of the staff are ready for, unfortunately, the next wave of casualties,” the hospital’s director, Salman Zarka, told CNN.
     
            Ziv Medical Center is the only hospital in the area and the closest to Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, as well as the occupied Golan Heights. The hospital in Safed has been receiving people injured in cross-border fire for months, including children hurt in the deadly attack on Majdal Shams in July.
     
            “When you have combat on the ground, usually you have more wounded and, unfortunately, dead soldiers. I hope it will not happen, (but) we have to be ready,” Zarka, an IDF reservist and a former commander of the IDF’s Medical Services Center, added.

            Israel’s military ordered additional residents of northern Gaza to move south ahead of planned military operations on Saturday.
     
            The residents join tens of thousands of other Palestinians who were told to leave in a round of evacuation orders issued Monday.
     
            The army will operate “with great force” in the areas of Jabalya and Nazla, north of Gaza City, and will continue to do so “for an extended period,” according to the military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee.
     
            “You must evacuate the area immediately,” he said, adding that the area, including the shelters within it, was considered a “dangerous combat zone.” He told residents that they should move south to the military’s so-called “humanitarian zone.”
     
            That zone, in the coastal area of Al Mawasi, is already crammed with refugees and has been hit by repeated Israeli airstrikes including one that killed at least 19 people in September.
     
            The military dropped flyers on Saturday morning warning people to “evacuate immediately,” according to residents.
     
            On Friday, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said thousands of people already cannot leave northern Gaza despite evacuation orders from the military, due to gunfire and strikes around evacuation routes.
     
            Palestinians fleeing the designated areas covered by Monday’s order in northern Gaza were shot at as they attempted to leave, according to residents there and footage shared with CNN.
     
            In July the UN reported that approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza had been internally displaced, many of them multiple times, due to repeated evacuation orders across the territory.
     
            Aid organizations have previously said new rounds of evacuation orders make the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.
     
            No food has entered northern Gaza since the start of October, putting 1 million people at risk of going hungry, the World Food Programme told CNN on Friday.
     
            Iran’s government is extremely nervous and has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with countries in the Middle East to gauge whether they can reduce the scale of Israel’s response to its missile attack earlier this month and – if that fails – help protect Tehran, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            Iran’s anxiety stems from uncertainty about whether the US can convince Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites and oil facilities, and the fact that its most important proxy militia in the region, Hezbollah, has been significantly weakened by Israeli military operations in recent weeks, the sources said.
     
            The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months, telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.”
     
            The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, have also expressed concern to the US about a potential attack on Iranian oil facilities, which could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN.

            Sri Lanka’s foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns” Israel’s attack on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon that injured two of its soldiers on Friday.
     
            The peacekeepers were injured in an attack at the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) headquarters in the southern city of Naqoura, the Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement.
     
            On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces acknowledged it hit a UNIFIL base and said it was looking into the circumstances surrounding the incident. Its soldiers fired at “an immediate threat against them” and later found a UNIFIL post near the “source of the threat” was hit, injuring two UNIFIL peacekeepers, it said.
     
            UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix on Thursday said the situation in southern Lebanon is “increasingly alarming,” with UN peacekeepers “at serious risk.”
     
            The head of Ireland’s armed forces, Lieutenant General Sean Clancy, earlier said Israeli fire that hit the UN peacekeeping position in southern Lebanon on Friday seemed “deliberate,” given the circumstances.
     
            This is the second incident of Israeli tank fire resulting in injuries to UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon this week. Two Indonesian peacekeepers were hospitalized on Thursday following a similar incident.
     
            A nursing home in central Israel was damaged following the downing of a drone originating from Lebanon, according to officials.
     
            The Israeli military said alerts had been activated after it detected two aircraft crossing from Lebanon, according to a statement on Friday night.
     
            The military said the Air Force had successfully intercepted one aircraft but did not specify what had happened to the second.
     
            “At this stage there is damage to a building in Herzliya,” the statement added. Herzliya is a coastal city in central Israel.
     
            Images and video shared by the military showed damage to what it said was a nursing home, “following the (drone) attack.”
     
            Broken windows and destroyed furniture could be seen along with water pooled on the floor of an adjoining hallway.
     
            Israeli police received “multiple” reports of rocket fragments landing in the Herzliya area, according to a spokesperson.
     
            Police officers and bomb disposal experts arrived to manage “debris from the interception,” the spokesperson said.
     
            Neither statement indicated there were casualties. The military said the incident was under investigation.
     
            Thailand’s foreign ministry said it was “profoundly saddened” by the death of a Thai worker in northern Israel on Friday, according to a statement.
     
            Earlier in the day Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency response service had reported that the Thai national had been killed in the Upper Galilee region after an anti-tank missile was fired from Lebanon.
     
            The Thai foreign ministry disputed that account, saying the death, and the injury of another of its nationals, had resulted from “an explosion of dropped ammunition” without providing additional details.
     
            The ministry added that its embassy in Israel was closely monitoring the condition of the injured worker and awaiting autopsy results to confirm the identity of the deceased before notifying the family.
     
            The statement said the embassy was working to evacuate 10 additional Thai nationals from the kibbutz where the incident had occurred. It asked other Thai citizens having trouble leaving high-risk areas of Israel to contact the embassy for assistance.
     
            The agriculture industry in Israel has employed thousands of Thai nationals to tend crops and work in dairies.
     
            Thais made up the largest group of foreign nationals killed in the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. Most were workers on agricultural sites close to the perimeter fence that separates Israel from Gaza.
     
            In the months after the attack an estimated 10,000 farm workers left, according to the Israeli government.
     
            Nicaragua is breaking diplomatic relations with Israel over its war in Gaza, its Vice President Rosario Murillo announced on Friday.
     
            Murillo said that the “repudiation” measure is not against the people of Israel but against its government.
     
            CNN has contacted the Israeli consulate in Nicaragua for comment.
     
Context: The announcement comes on the back of statements made by Nicaragua’s foreign minister Valdrack Ludwing Jaentschke Whitaker in a speech to the UN General Assembly in late September, where Whitaker denounced and condemned “the genocide that the Government of Israel and its ‘First World’ allies have committed, commit and continue to commit” across the Middle East.
     
            In January, Nicaragua’s government applied to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to join the genocide lawsuit that South Africa filed against Israel in December last year.
     
            Israel has rejected the genocide charges, arguing that the war against Hamas in Gaza is conducted in self-defense. Israel also maintains that it is not fighting the Palestinian people, and that its leaders have not shown any intent to commit genocide.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke separately on Friday with Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri as Israeli military operations in the country continue, including deadly strikes in Beirut Thursday.
     
            According to State Department readouts of both calls, Blinken reiterated the US’ “commitment to a diplomatic resolution to the conflict across the Blue Line,” referring to the roughly 120-kilometer boundary between the two countries established by the United Nations in 2000 to ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces.
     
            The top US diplomat “underscored enduring United States support for Lebanese institutions that can help stabilize the country, including the Lebanese Armed Forces,” and called for the country not to allow Iran or Hezbollah to “stand in the way” of Lebanon’s security, the readout from the Mikati call said.
     
            In both calls, Blinken discussed the presidential vacancy in Lebanon and the need to fill it with a leader “that reflects the will of the people for a stable, prosperous, and independent Lebanon.”
     
            Neither readout mentioned the deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut or the ongoing ground operations in the south of Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s military says it is investigating after Lebanese officials blamed an Israeli strike for the killing of two of the country’s soldiers on Friday.
     
            The Lebanese army said earlier that Israeli strikes targeting an army base in Kafra, southern Lebanon, killed two of its soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces now tells CNN that it is looking into the reported incident, and added that it was unaware of a Lebanese Armed Forces facility in the area:
     
        “Earlier today, the IDF struck Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon. A short while after, a report was received regarding that several LAF soldiers were hit in the area during the strikes. Upon receiving the report, the IDF began to conduct an in-depth examination of the incident. The IDF emphasizes that it is unaware of any LAF facility being found in the area of the strike,” the Israeli military.
     
 
Some background: While Israel is at war with Hezbollah — the Iran-backed paramilitary group that operates in southern Lebanon — its strikes have also killed more than 1,400 Lebanese civilians and at least three of the country’s soldiers, according to Lebanon’s government.
     
            The IDF reiterated in its statement Friday that it is fighting Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and not the state of Lebanon.
     
            Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati earlier condemned the strike in Kafra as a part of a “persistent Israeli crime against Lebanon.”
     
            The US government expanded sanctions on two Iranian energy sectors in an effort to cut off revenue that the US says Tehran is using to fund proxy groups and foment instability in the region.
     
            Friday’s actions were taken in response to Tehran’s missile attack on Israel earlier this month, the Treasury Department said in a press release. It comes while the region is on edge about potential conflagration as Israel weighs its potential answer to that attack.
     
            “In the aftermath of Iran’s unprecedented October 1 attack against Israel, the United States made clear that we would impose consequences on Iran for its actions,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Friday. “To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate conflict throughout the Middle East.”
     
Remember: Hezbollah, which Israel is fighting in Lebanon, and Hamas, which it is fighting in Gaza, are two members of an axis of militant groups funded by Iran, which also operate in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
     
            Thousands of people are unable to leave northern Gaza’s Jabalya refugee camp despite evacuation warnings from the Israeli military, due to gunfire and strikes around evacuation routes, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) on Friday.
     
            CNN has previously reported incidents of evacuees from Jabalya coming under fire. One man said he and his family fled their home in Jabalya due to continuous bombing in the area, and that he and other civilians were shot at when they went back to retrieve supplies.
     
            Five MSF staff members are currently trapped at the camp, according to a post on X from the organization, which is also known as Doctors Without Borders.
     
            “Nobody is allowed to get in or out, anyone who tries is getting shot,” MSF project coordinator Sarah Vuylsteke added, in a post on MSF’s official X account.
     
            Haydar, a driver working for the organization who is trapped at the camp, was also quoted by MSF describing his fear of attempting to flee the dangerous area:
     
        “I don’t know what to do, at any moment we could die. People are starving. I am afraid to stay, and I am also afraid to leave.”
     
        said Haydar, MSF driver.
     
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on allegations that its troops are firing near evacuation routes and that MSF workers are trapped.
     
Some background: The Israel Defense Forces launched its latest ground operation in Jabalya on Sunday, where it said it was encircling the area after seeing signs of Hamas rebuilding, despite a year of fighting and intense strikes on the area.
     
            The IDF told residents across several parts of northern Gaza, including Jabalya, to evacuate on Monday, warning that it is “currently operating with great force in the area.”

            • US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with top Lebanese officials on Friday as Israeli military operations in the country continue, including deadly strikes in Beirut Thursday that left at least 22 dead.
     
            • Israel’s security cabinet has yet to agree on its response to Iran’s missile attack earlier this month, but the gaps between the US and Israeli positions are narrowing, a source told CNN. US President Joe Biden has said Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.”
     
            • A UN inquiry has accused Israel of war crimes during its year-long war against Hamas in Gaza, saying Israel carried out a “concerted policy” of destroying the enclave’s health care system. Palestinians are living in desperate conditions, with food not having reached northern Gaza since last month, the UN says.
     
            • Concerns are mounting for the safety of UN troops in southern Lebanon. The UN says Israel’s military has hit its peacekeeping base twice in the last 48 hours, injuring four of its troops and drawing international condemnation.
     
            Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
     
            Nicaragua is breaking diplomatic relations with Israel over its war in Gaza, its Vice President Rosario Murillo announced on Friday.
     
            Murillo said that the “repudiation” measure is not against the people of Israel but against its government.
     
            CNN has contacted the Israeli consulate in Nicaragua for comment.
     
Context: The announcement comes on the back of statements made by Nicaragua’s foreign minister Valdrack Ludwing Jaentschke Whitaker in a speech to the UN General Assembly in late September, where Whitaker denounced and condemned “the genocide that the Government of Israel and its ‘First World’ allies have committed, commit and continue to commit” across the Middle East.
     
            In January, Nicaragua’s government applied to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to join the genocide lawsuit that South Africa filed against Israel in December last year.
     
            Israel has rejected the genocide charges, arguing that the war against Hamas in Gaza is conducted in self-defense. Israel also maintains that it is not fighting the Palestinian people, and that its leaders have not shown any intent to commit genocide.
     
            Thailand’s foreign ministry said it was “profoundly saddened” by the death of a Thai worker in northern Israel on Friday, according to a statement.
     
            Earlier in the day Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency response service had reported that the Thai national had been killed in the Upper Galilee region after an anti-tank missile was fired from Lebanon.
     
            The Thai foreign ministry disputed that account, saying the death, and the injury of another of its nationals, had resulted from “an explosion of dropped ammunition” without providing additional details.
     
            The ministry added that its embassy in Israel was closely monitoring the condition of the injured worker and awaiting autopsy results to confirm the identity of the deceased before notifying the family.
     
            The statement said the embassy was working to evacuate 10 additional Thai nationals from the kibbutz where the incident had occurred. It asked other Thai citizens having trouble leaving high-risk areas of Israel to contact the embassy for assistance.
     
            The agriculture industry in Israel has employed thousands of Thai nationals to tend crops and work in dairies.

            Israel has been pounding the Lebanese capital of Beirut and other areas in the south of the country at an unprecedented intensity since escalating its war against the Iran-backed paramilitary group Hezbollah.
     
            The Israeli strikes have often targeted crowded areas, leveling residential buildings, killing more than 1,400 people and displacing over 1 million others, according to the Lebanese government.
     
            Israel’s military accuses Hezbollah of intentionally embedding itself within the civilian population, and says it is striking weapons stores and other key infrastructure for the militant group.
     
These were some of the latest scenes of destruction in Lebanon on Friday:
 
            An Israeli strike on a Lebanese army center in Kafra, south Lebanon, killed two soldiers and wounded three, according to the army.
     
            Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned Israel for the attack, also criticizing the international community for what he said has been silence about “Israel’s crimes.”
     
        “This persistent Israeli crime against Lebanon did not spare today brave soldiers who are carrying out their national duty in protecting the land and defending the people, and it is the responsibility of the international community that is silent on Israel’s crimes, while what is required is a global stand of conscience to put an end to this aggression,” Mikati said on X.
     
 
            While Israel is at war with Hezbollah — the Iran-backed paramilitary group that operates in southern Lebanon — its strikes have also killed at least three Lebanese soldiers and wounded five others, according to Lebanon’s government.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
     
            Israel has acknowledged it struck the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) headquarters in Naqoura, southern Lebanon, on Friday, resulting in injuries to two peacekeepers who were transferred to hospitals in Lebanon.
     
            UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told CNN’s Becky Anderson that one of the peacekeepers was seriously injured in Friday’s explosion — the second to hit the headquarters in 48 hours — after being hit in the stomach by shrapnel.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Friday that its soldiers “identified an immediate threat against them” and “responded with fire toward the threat.”
     
            “Hours before the incident, the IDF instructed UNIFIL personnel to enter into protected spaces and remain there. This instruction was in place at the time of the incident,” the IDF said.
     
Key context: Concern was already growing for the safety of peacekeepers in southern Lebanon after the UN accused Israeli troops of injuring two UNIFIL personnel in a separate incident on Thursday.
     
            In a Friday statement, UNIFIL said several concrete walls used to shield a UN position near the Blue Line in the southwest village of Labbouneh collapsed when an Israeli armored bulldozer struck its perimeter, after which “IDF tanks moved in the proximity of the UN position.”
     
            In a statement on X, the IDF said it had been notified that two peacekeepers were “inadvertently hurt during IDF combat against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.”
     
            The injuries to UN troops have drawn international condemnation, including from France and Ireland, both of which have contingents from their national armies in the Lebanon peacekeeping mission. On Friday, France’s foreign ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador to Paris over the issue.
     
            More than 220 people have been killed in northern Gaza since the Israeli military launched renewed attacks there last weekend, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense and Ministry of Health.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces escalated operations in the north of the enclave on Saturday, targeting what it says is Hamas’ renewed presence there.
     
            Footage has emerged of upturned cars strewn across dusty streets, buildings leveled to rubble, and Palestinian residents desperately trying to flee the area — scenes reminiscent of the early days of the war, when Israel concentrated attacks in northern Gaza.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Thursday to discuss Israel’s military operations in Lebanon and “emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of UNIFIL forces in the area,” according to the Pentagon.
     
            UNIFIL, the United Nations’ peacekeeping force in Lebanon, said on Thursday that Israeli forces had fired on its positions and injured two members of the force. Austin’s call came after UN Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix described hostilities between Israeli forces and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon as “increasingly alarming,” and putting “peacekeepers at serious risk.”
     
            In his call with Gallant, Austin emphasized the US commitment to a “diplomatic arrangement that safely returns both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on both sides of the border,” and urged Israel to “pivot” from military operations to a diplomatic pathway “as soon as feasible,” the Pentagon said. More than 1,400 people have been killed by Israel’s operations in Lebanon since late last month, CNN has reported.
     
            A Palestinian hospital director has warned that three health care facilities in northern Gaza are on the verge of running out of fuel, as Israeli forces move deeper into the besieged region.
     
            Patients relying on ventilators in Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia “will die” if the Israeli military does not allow fuel to enter the northern parts of Gaza, Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, the director of the hospital, told CNN on Friday.
     
            “There have been many attempts to bring fuel in, but the Israeli military have prevented that,” he said. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            A number of patients have been transferred to other hospitals in Gaza City, according to Abu Saifiya, after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital on Wednesday. CNN had reached out to the IDF for comment.
     
        “We are facing a new challenge and a catastrophic situation,” Abu Saifiya said in a video shared by the Ministry of Health in Gaza on Friday. “We have 24 hours left. It’s not just Kamal Adwan Hospital; Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital are also on the verge of running out of the remaining fuel.”
     
 
            Palestinian health workers at Kamal Adwan Hospital can be seen delicately nursing a baby in the video. In another scene, young children connected to ventilators lie on blue hospital gurneys. Some have wounds, with thick bandages swaddled around their bodies. It is the only specialized neonatal intensive care unit in the area, according to the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians.
     
            No food has entered northern Gaza since the start of October, putting 1 million people at risk of going hungry, the World Food Programme told CNN on Friday.
     
            In August, approximately 700 hundred aid trucks entered northern Gaza. In September, only 400 aid trucks entered, after commercial operations ceased at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, the WFP added. No food trucks have entered northern Gaza in October, the WFP told CNN.
     
            On Wednesday, the WFP said in a report that the aid entering the strip has plummeted to its lowest level in months, forcing the organization to stop the distribution of food parcels in October.
     
            “Hunger remains rampant and the threat of famine persists,” WFP added. “If the flow of assistance does not resume, one million vulnerable people will be deprived on this lifeline.”
     
            Earlier this week, the UN’s OCHA said: “September saw the lowest volume of commercial and humanitarian supplies entering Gaza since at least March 2024.”
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military about the lack of food and aid entering the strip.
     
Israeli incursion in the north: The warning from the UN came against the backdrop of Israel’s renewed ground operation in northern Gaza on October 6, after seeing signs of Hamas rebuilding.
     
            The military has issued fresh evacuation orders for residents in northern Gaza, adding it had expanded the scope of the “humanitarian area” in Al-Mawasi in the south.
     
Journalist Mohammad al-Sawalhi contributed to this report from Gaza.
 
            Two of central Gaza’s main bakeries have been shut down for three days, according to CNN footage and bakery workers, as humanitarian agencies warned of blocked access to the Palestinian enclave.
     
            Al-Banna Bakery and Zadna Bakery in Deir al-Balah, both supported by the WFP, have halted operations due to a lack of flour and fuel, bakery workers and residents told CNN. CNN video from the bakeries shows bare conveyor belts and shelves emptied of stock. Parents in the area said they cannot find enough food to feed their children, while local staff trying to support their families are losing wages.
     
            “I am the head of a family of six. The day I work, I can feed my family. The day I don’t, we don’t eat,” said Ahmad Abed, an employee at Al-Banna Bakery. “People are chasing flour, and we go to bakeries searching for where bread is available.”
     
            Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network, told CNN that the depletion of flour and other production materials has led to the closure of essential bakeries that produce bread.
     
            Bread remains the number one staple food for Palestinians and has become a crucial basic necessity since the war started just over a year ago.
     
        We’ve been suffering for 4 days, searching for bakeries to get some bread for ourselves and our children, but we find none,” Haitham Badr, a father in central Gaza, told CNN. “I need bread to feed my children, but there’s no bread. There’s nothing worse than this.”
     
 
            At least 42,126 Palestinians have been killed and another 98,117 injured since Israel launched its war in Gaza on October 7, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.
     
            In the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes in the strip killed at least 61 people and wounded 231 people, the ministry reported on Thursday.
     
            The United Arab Emirates is “seriously concerned” as the regional war expands and believes it is imperative that the US play an effective role to diffuse tensions, a top official told CNN.
     
        “At this critical juncture, the UAE believes a robust and effective American role is extremely necessary,” said Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, adding that there was a need for de-escalation “along all fronts, including Israel and Iran.”
     
 
            The UAE is the Middle East’s commercial and tourism hub and has strong economic ties with both Israel and Iran.
     
            He said that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian made “encouraging statements” at the United Nations General Assembly last month, but those statement have been “undermined by the current escalation.”
     
            Pezeshkian said at the United Nations that his country is ready to engage with the West on its disputed nuclear program, and said Iran was ready to lay down its arms if Israel did the same.
     
Key stakeholders: Both the UAE and Iran are major oil producers and Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-third of the world’s seaborne oil trade passes. US President Joe Biden has cautioned against an Israeli strike on Iranian oil interests. Tehran has in previous years warned that if it cannot sell its own oil, then it won’t allow others in the region to do so either.
     
            A disruption to oil production from Middle Eastern states could lead to global oil prices skyrocketing. Gargash also stressed the urgent need for a ceasefire in in Gaza and Lebanon.
     
            The Israeli military announced on Friday that it killed a commander in the Hezbollah Radwan Forces’ anti-tank missile unit, in the Lebanese area of Meiss El Jabal, as Israel’s ground incursion in the country’s south rages on.
     
            In a statement, the Israeli military said Araeb el Shoga “was responsible for numerous anti-tank missile attacks on the area of Ramot Naftali in northern Israel.” 
 
            Israeli forces “also identified and struck a launcher that was ready to fire toward Israeli territory and soldiers” and “struck Hezbollah weapons storage facilities,” the military added. CNN cannot independently verify the statement.
     
Elsewhere in Lebanon: Israeli forces also intensified an aerial campaign in the Lebanese capital late Thursday, killing at least 22 people and wounding at least 117 others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            The strikes in the densely populated upper Basta neighborhood marked the single deadliest Israeli attack in central Beirut since Israel’s 34-day-war in 2006, which killed 1,100 people in Lebanon.
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin was meeting his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian for the first time on Friday, as relations between the two sanctioned nations warm and the Middle East braces for Israel’s response to Tehran’s largest-ever missile attack last week.
     
            The meeting at a regional summit in Ashgabat, the capital of the Central Asian country Turkmenistan, also comes against a backdrop of closer military ties between Iran and Russia’s military in recent years, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
     
            Iran has supplied thousands of “Shahed” attack drones to Russia, and according to US officials, built a drone factory in Russia. Iran also recently transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use in the war against Ukraine, CNN reported in September, marking a significant escalation in the country’s support for Moscow.
     
            “Since Ukraine, the two countries have been more equal in terms of both needing each other and relying each other on specific issues. And that, I think, has been seen as beneficial from the Iranian side,” said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, senior analyst and associate fellow, at UK think tank Chatham House.
     
            Moscow and Tehran have a de facto military alliance in the region to support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Analysts say the countries have found further common ground as they are increasingly isolated by global sanctions.

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US would “engage intensely” to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East as concerns grow that Israel’s wars with Iranian proxies could escalate into a full-scale regional war.
     
        “We’re working very hard, through deterrence and through diplomacy to prevent that from happening,” Blinken told reporters at a gathering of Asian leaders in Laos on Friday.
     
 
            Blinken also said he had “a real concern about the inadequacy of the assistance” reaching people in Gaza, stressing the US is “directly engaged with Israel on the imperative of addressing the humanitarian needs” in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
     
            His remarks come after the US ambassador to the United Nations said Wednesday that Israel must urgently address the “catastrophic conditions” in Gaza and that “actions by the Israeli government to limit the delivery of aid” would intensify suffering.
     
On Lebanon: Blinken emphasized the need for a “diplomatic solution in Lebanon,” amid an Israeli ground incursion in the south of the country and intensified airstrikes as it fights Hezbollah.
     
            He also expressed support for a stronger Lebanese state emerging from the conflict.
     
        “It’s clear that the people of Lebanon have a strong interest in the state asserting itself and taking responsibility for the country and its future,” he said, adding Lebanon’s future, “is for the Lebanese people to decide, not for anyone else.”
     
 
            Israel’s security cabinet did not reach a decision on how to respond to Iran’s missile attack following discussions on the matter, a source familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday.
     
            The gaps between the US and Israeli positions were narrowing, the source added.
     
US President Joe Biden has said Israel’s retaliation for the October 1 Iranian missile barrage should be “proportional.”

            Two Palestinian militants were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, the Israeli military said.
     
            The strike in the Tulkarm area killed Muhammad Abdullah, head of the Nur Shams branch of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and another unnamed militant, according to an Israel Defense Forces statement Friday.
     
            In a statement, the Palestinian Ministry of Health announced the killing of Muhammad Iyad Muhammad Abdullah, 20, and Awad Jamil Saqr Omar, 31, “as a result of the occupation’s bombing near Nour Shams camp in Tulkarm.”
     
            A United Nations inquiry has accused Israel of carrying out a “concerted policy” of destroying the health care system in Gaza during its year-long conflict with Hamas in attacks it said amount to war crimes.
     
            Israel’s actions in the besieged Palestinian enclave “constitute the war crimes of willful killing and mistreatment and the crime against humanity of extermination,” the commission said in a statement Thursday.
     
        “Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles” in Gaza, according to the report by the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.
     
 
            The Israeli attacks resulted in “fuel, food, water, medicines and medical supplies not reaching hospitals, while also drastically reducing permits for patients to leave the territory for medical treatment,” it said.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and the Israeli foreign ministry about the report, but has not yet heard back. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of operating in and around health care facilities in the Palestinian enclave – using them for military operations, including as command centers, weapons stores and to hide hostages.
     
            Israel has released footage they say is evidence of those Hamas operations. The videos do not offer definitive proof, and Hamas has denied the claims.
     
            “Our forces on the ground know where these hospitals are, and nodes are taken into account when they’re operating,” a legal adviser to the IDF told CNN earlier this year about the process of approving strikes against targets near hospitals. “But at the end of the day, as long as Hamas continues to use these hospitals and facilities for the military operations, and our aim is to defeat Hamas militarily, there is absolutely no choice but to go there.”
     
            The report also accused Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups of committing war crimes of “torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, rape and sexual violence” for their treatment of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza. It also investigated “institutionalized mistreatment” of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
     
            In a statement accompanying the 24-page report, which does not have the force of law, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Israel “must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction” in Gaza.
     
        “Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,” she said.
     
 
            As part of the report, UN experts investigated the killing of 5-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who made headlines in late January after a recording emerged of her pleading to emergency workers to rescue her and her family after they became trapped in their car due to Israeli shelling.
     
            Despite an ambulance arriving at the scene while the girl was still alive, the presence of Israeli security forces effectively “prevented access,” meaning the bodies of Rajab’s relatives “could not be retrieved from their bullet-ridden car until 12 days after the incident,” the report said.
     
            The report “determined on reasonable grounds that the Israeli Army’s 162nd Division” which operated in the area at the time is “responsible for killing the family of seven, shelling the ambulance and killing the two paramedics inside.”
     
            The incident was just one of several alleged attacks on health care in Gaza, amid broader wartime conditions.
     
            The report will be presented to the UN General Assembly on October 30.
     
            The commission previously alleged that both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in the early stages of the Gaza war, and that Israel’s actions also amounted to crimes against humanity.
     
            Up to 2.5 million people need “urgent humanitarian food assistance” in Lebanon as Israel’s war with Hezbollah rages in the country, according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
     
            In a report published Thursday, USAID – citing its Famine Early Warning Systems Network – said the number of people requiring help had risen to up to 40% of the population.
     
            Several regions are expected to remain at “crisis” level until January, including the capital Beirut and its southern suburbs.
     
        According to the report, “current and anticipated food supply chain disruptions are driving households to stockpile food and essentials amid rising prices of bread and other staple commodities.”
     
 
            Israel has pummeled Lebanon with an unprecedented airstrike campaign, killing more than 1,500 people, injuring more than 8,000 and displacing more than 1 million people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            A quarter of Lebanese territory is under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the United Nations, a sign of the growing scale of the humanitarian crisis and expansion of Israel’s war against Hezbollah.
     
            An entire residential building was leveled in a deadly Israeli strike on central Beirut Thursday, a Lebanese security source told CNN, as Israel reportedly targeted a senior Hezbollah official in a densely populated neighborhood.
     
            At least 22 people were killed and at least 117 wounded in Israeli strikes on the Lebanese capital Thursday night, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            Israel has not publicly claimed Thursday’s strikes or confirmed any targets.
     
Here’s what we know:
 
            Indonesia blasted Israel on Friday for what it called “deliberate attacks” that injured two of its UN peacekeepers in Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s actions “represent a blatant attempt to spread terror on the ground to intimidate both the peacekeeping mission and international community,” Indonesia’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X after the peacekeepers from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were wounded Thursday by Israeli tank fire in the southern city of Naqoura.
     
            Addressing the UN Security Council on Thursday, Indonesia’s UN ambassador Hari Prabowo said Israel’s actions were unacceptable.
     
            “Let me be clear: those who stand by the cause of peace will not be afraid of bullies and perpetrator of genocide,” Prabowo said, according to Jakarta’s mission to the UN.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces earlier said its troops were operating “in the area of Naqoura, next to a UNIFIL base” and that “the IDF instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area.” The Israeli military has also accused Hezbollah of operating near UN peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon.
     
            Indonesia’s criticism follows international condemnation of Israel over several recent attacks on UN peacekeeping positions, including heavy criticism from France, Ireland and Italy, which have contingents from their national armies in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
     
            On Thursday, the UN peacekeeping chief said the situation in southern Lebanon is “increasingly alarming,” with peacekeepers “at serious risk.”
     
What is UNIFIL? The UN’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon was established by the UN Security Council in 1978, following the Israeli invasion of the country’s south. The agency established the Blue Line – an area spanning 120 kilometers along southern Lebanon – in 2000, to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.
     
            Israel should take “all feasible steps” to protect civilians during its military operations, a US State Department spokesperson said, after deadly Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese capital on Thursday.
     
            The United States supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran-backed Hezbollah, but “how it does so matters,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
     
            “We continue to press Israel to take all feasible steps to protect civilians throughout its operations, in particular in the densely populated areas of Beirut,” they added.
     
            The death toll from the Israeli strikes in central Beirut has risen to at least 22, with at least 117 people wounded, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health.
     
            A senior Hezbollah official was the target, according to a source in the militant group and Israeli media reports. Wafiq Safa, leader of Hezbollah’s liaison unit, survived the assassination attempt, the Hezbollah source told CNN. Israel has not publicly claimed Thursday’s strikes or confirmed any targets.
     
            When the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize is announced in Sweden on Friday, Israel and Lebanon will be among more than 50 countries experiencing armed conflict.
     
            For that reason – and to send a message that “the institutions of world order seem incapable” of reducing conflict – the Nobel Committee should withhold this year’s peace prize, Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told CNN.
     
            As well as war in the Middle East, conflict is raging in Ukraine, Sudan, West Africa, Haiti, Myanmar and elsewhere, said Smith, one of the world’s foremost authorities on the peace prize.
     
        “There is fighting and killing going on at a scale that we have not experienced since before the end of the Cold War,” he said. “Somehow we need to get more energy and attention focused on that.”
     
 
            His “modest suggestion” is that the committee withhold the honor this year to highlight “the deficiency in world politics at the moment.”
     
            The Nobel Peace Prize has been withheld on 19 previous occasions, including during World War I and II, but has been awarded each year since 1972.
     
            While there are many worthy potential winners, not giving out the prize would “send a very powerful message,” said Smith.
     
            Concerns are mounting for the safety of peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, a senior United Nations official warned on Thursday, after the UN accused Israeli troops of injuring two UNIFIL personnel.
 
            Briefing the UN Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix described the situation in southern Lebanon as an “increasingly alarming” one which is putting UN “peacekeepers at serious risk.”
     
        “Two peacekeepers were wounded when earlier today a UN observation post [OP-14] in UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura was hit by tank fire. The safety and security of peacekeepers is now increasingly in jeopardy,” Lacroix said.
     
 
            The IDF has said its troops were operating “in the area of Naqoura, next to a UNIFIL base” and that “the IDF instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area.”
     
            The Israeli military has also accused Hezbollah of operating near UN peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon.
     
            UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said the two peacekeepers, both from Indonesia, remain hospitalized, but their injuries are not serious.
     
            The incident drew condemnation from several countries with military contingents in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
     
            France expressed its “deep concern” after the attack, saying it was “awaiting explanations from the Israeli authorities.”
     
            Irish foreign minister, Micheál Martin described the IDF’s “targeting & firing on UNIFIL positions” as “reprehensible” and “unacceptable.”
     
What is UNIFIL? The UN’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon was established by the UN Security Council in 1978, following the Israeli invasion of the country’s south. The agency established the Blue Line – an area spanning 120 kilometers along southern Lebanon – in 2000, in order to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.
     
            On Wednesday, a UNIFIL spokesperson told CNN that Israeli invasions were ongoing “a bit everywhere in the proximity” of the Blue Line, as the Israeli military expands operations across southern Lebanon.
     
            Iran will support its proxy groups “however necessary” and will stand “strongly by the resistance,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera in an interview aired Thursday.
     
        “I visited Beirut as Israel continuously targeted it, and from there I announced to Hezbollah and Lebanese officials that Iran will not relinquish its support for the resistance,” he said, according to Al Jazeera’s translation, in response to a question on Hezbollah and other proxy groups.
     
 
            Iran backs the two main groups fighting Israel: Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a strike on Beirut, two months after killing Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
            In response, Iran fired dozens of missiles on Israeli cities last week. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to respond to the attack.
     
            Over the past weeks, Iranian officials have shuttled between neighboring Arab countries for consultations in anticipation of an Israeli attack. Araghchi met Qatari officials in Doha on Thursday, a day after meeting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.
     
            Araghchi told Al Jazeera that communication channels with the United States remain open through third parties.

            Indonesia blasted Israel on Friday for what it called “deliberate attacks” that injured two of its UN peacekeepers in Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s actions “represent a blatant attempt to spread terror on the ground to intimidate both the peacekeeping mission and international community,” Indonesia’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X after the peacekeepers from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were wounded Thursday by Israeli tank fire in the southern city of Naqoura.

            People could be seen overwhelmed with grief outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center, where some of the casualties of Thursday night’s strikes on the city center are being treated.
     
            Outside the emergency ward, an elderly woman rocked back and forth with a dazed look in her eyes.
     
            A man came to her with terrible news: “Abbas’s son and daughter are martyrs,” he said, his hand on her shoulder. “Thank God for everything. Don’t forget to say thank God for everything.”
     
            A few moments later, the woman burst into tears.
     
            At least 22 people were killed in an Israeli attack on Thursday night local time, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health. More than a hundred others were injured.
     
            Asked for comment on the strikes, the Israeli military said it was looking into reports.
     
            Concerns are mounting for the safety of peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, a senior United Nations official warned on Thursday, after the UN accused Israeli troops of injuring two UNIFIL personnel.
 
            Briefing the UN Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix described the situation in southern Lebanon as an “increasingly alarming” one which is putting UN “peacekeepers at serious risk.”
     
        “Two peacekeepers were wounded when earlier today a UN observation post [OP-14] in UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura was hit by tank fire. The safety and security of peacekeepers is now increasingly in jeopardy,” Lacroix said.
     
 
            The IDF has said its troops were operating “in the area of Naqoura, next to a UNIFIL base” and that “the IDF instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area.”
     
            The Israeli military has also accused Hezbollah of operating near UN peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon.
     
            UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said the two peacekeepers, both from Indonesia, remain hospitalized, but their injuries are not serious.
     
            The incident drew condemnation from several countries including France and Ireland, both of whom have military contingents in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
     
            France expressed its “deep concern” after the attack, saying it was “awaiting explanations from the Israeli authorities.”
     
            Irish foreign minister, Micheál Martin described the IDF’s “targeting & firing on UNIFIL positions” as “reprehensible” and “unacceptable.”
     
What is UNIFIL? The UN’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon was established by the UN Security Council in 1978, following the Israeli invasion of the country’s south. The agency established the Blue Line – an area spanning 120 kilometers along southern Lebanon – in 2000, in order to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.
     
            On Wednesday, a UNIFIL spokesperson told CNN that Israeli invasions were ongoing “a bit everywhere in the proximity” of the Blue Line, as the Israeli military expands operations across southern Lebanon.

            Senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa survived Thursday night’s strikes in central Beirut, a source in the militant group told CNN.
     
            Safa was the target of the Israeli attack in the Lebanese capital, according to the Hezbollah source and reports in Israeli media.
     
            Safa is a political official who leads Hezbollah’s liaison unit, charged with managing the Iran-backed group’s domestic and international affairs.
     
            Israel has not publicly claimed Thursday’s strikes or confirmed any targets.
     
            Two witnesses told CNN they saw an entire building collapse from one of tonight’s strikes in central Beirut, saying the structure was full of recently displaced people and residents.
     
        “The bomb hit. And the entire building fell down,” one of the witnesses, Hassan, told CNN outside a hospital near Beirut’s Upper Basta neigborhood. “There were so many people in the building. Not just the residents but also people who were displaced from other parts of the country,” he said.
     
 
            A Lebanese security source had earlier told CNN an Israeli strike collapsed a four-story building in Upper Basta.
     
            “Im waiting for my brother and sister,” Partim, a migrant worker from Bangladesh, told CNN outside the hospital where people had gathered to hear news of their loved ones.
     
            “They were the concierges of the building. I’m sure they’re ok,” he said.
     
            Another man was being comforted by a group of his friends. “Don’t worry,” one friend tells him. “I’m sure we’ll hear from her very soon.”
     
            At Beirut’s Al Nuwairi neighborhood, the site of another strike, a building’s third floor was hit. Firetrucks and ambulances were seen near the building, while women carrying bags fled the area.
     
            The death toll from strikes in central Beirut has risen to at least 22, with at least 117 people wounded, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health.
     
            The death toll from Thursday’s strikes in Lebanon’s capital city has risen to 18, according to the Ministry of Health. At least 92 people are wounded, the ministry said.
     
            At least 11 people were killed and 48 injured following an Israeli attack in Beirut on Thursday evening, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            It said the figures were an initial toll and called on “the media and social media to stop issuing calls to go to hospitals to donate blood because they would confuse rescue and emergency work.”
     
            A Lebanese security source told CNN that two Israeli airstrikes hit central Beirut on Thursday evening, in an attack which it said had leveled one residential building.
     
            Two Israeli airstrikes hit central Beirut on Thursday evening, in an attack which leveled an entire residential building, a Lebanese security source told CNN.
     
            According to the source, there are fears of a mass casualty event.
     
            The upper Basta neighborhood where the multi-story building was hit is a densely populated neighborhood where hundreds of people have fled to after the intensive Israeli strikes in southern Beirut and other parts of Lebanon in recent weeks.
     
            When asked for comment, the IDF said it was looking into reports.
     
            Thick plumes of black smoke rose into the sky after strikes hit central Beirut Thursday evening.
     
             A CNN team on the ground heard a loud explosion as the strike hit the Ras el Nabaa and Nowayreh areas of Beirut.
     
            The sirens of ambulances and gunshots were also heard.
     
            When asked for comment, the IDF said it was looking into reports.
     
            Iran will support its proxy groups “however necessary” and will stand “strongly by the resistance,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera in an on-camera interview aired on Thursday.
     
        “I visited Beirut as Israel continuously targeted it, and from there I announced to Hezbollah and Lebanese officials that Iran will not relinquish its support for the resistance,” he said, according to Al Jazeera’s translation, in response to a question on Hezbollah and other proxy groups.
     
 
            Iran backs the two main groups fighting Israel: Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a strike on Beirut, two months after killing Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
            In response, Iran fired dozens of missiles on Israeli cities last week. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to respond to the attack.
     
            Over the past weeks, Iranian officials have shuttled between neighboring Arab countries for consultations in anticipation of an Israeli attack. Araghchi met Qatari officials in Doha on Thursday, a day after meeting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.
     
            Araghchi told Al Jazeera that communication channels with the United States remain open through third parties.
     
            Amnesty International has called Israel’s evacuation warnings for civilians in Lebanon “misleading and inadequate.”
     
            The warnings fail to provide civilians with safe, practical options for evacuation, leaving them at heightened risk of harm during ongoing military operations, Amnesty said in a statement on Thursday.
     
            According to Amnesty’s investigation, Israel has urged residents in certain areas of Beirut’s southern suburbs and south Lebanon to flee their homes but has not provided crucial information such as safe evacuation routes or locations where civilians can seek refuge. These gaps, Amnesty argues, make it impossible for many civilians — particularly those who are elderly, disabled, or caring for young children — to evacuate safely.
     
        “Our analysis shows that not only did the warnings issued by the Israeli military include misleading maps, but they were also issued at short notice – in one instance less than 30 minutes before strikes began – in the middle of the night, via social media, when many people would be asleep, offline or not following media reports,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
     
 
            CNN conducted an analysis of Israeli military evacuation orders and found that at least seven hospitals are in the no-go zones imposed by the Israeli military in Beirut’s southern suburbs. CNN also previously reported that many evacuation orders were issued just minutes before strikes were conducted and, in some cases, not at all before strikes were conducted.
     
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on Amnesty’s report.

            When the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize is announced in Sweden on Friday, Israel and Lebanon will be among more than 50 countries experiencing armed conflict.
     
            For that reason – and to send a message that “the institutions of world order seem incapable” of reducing conflict – the Nobel Committee should withhold this year’s peace prize, Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told CNN.
     
            As well as war in the Middle East, conflict is raging in Ukraine, Sudan, West Africa, Haiti, Myanmar and elsewhere, said Smith, one of the world’s foremost authorities on the peace prize.
     
            “There is fighting and killing going on at a scale that we have not experienced since before the end of the Cold War,” he said. “Somehow we need to get more energy and attention focused on that.”
     
            His “modest suggestion” is that the committee withhold the honor this year to highlight “the deficiency in world politics at the moment.”
     
            The Nobel Peace Prize has been withheld on 19 previous occasions, including during World War I and II, but has been awarded each year since 1972.
     
            While there are many worthy potential winners, not giving out the prize would “send a very powerful message,” said Smith.
     
            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni summoned the Israeli ambassador in Rome on Thursday after what she described as the “unacceptable” behavior of Israeli forces who reportedly fired on bases manned by Italian peacekeepers in southern Lebanon.
     
            After the headquarters and two Italian bases of UNIFIL - UN peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon- were “hit by gunfire from the Israeli army” on Thursday, Meloni spoke to the Commander of the Western Sector of the UNIFIL mission, Gen. Stefano Messina, for an update on the safety of the Italian troops, her office said.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            The Italian leader also contacted Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant to “firmly remind” him that “what is happening near the Italian UNIFIL bases in southern Lebanon” is “unacceptable,” according to an Italian government statement.
     
            Meanwhile the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, condemned the shelling of UN peacekeepers by Israeli forces in a post on X Thursday, writing that “another line has been dangerously crossed in Lebanon.”
     
Remember: This is not the first time Israel has faced rebuke for the actions of its troops towards UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. Earlier this week, Israeli tanks stationed themselves close to an UN outpost manned by Irish peacekeepers, sparking concern from the Irish prime minister.
     
            The Israeli troops left the area on Tuesday after interventions were made by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who said the UN has been “very concerned” by the Israeli encroachment.

            The second stage of the UN-led polio vaccination campaign in Gaza is set to begin on Monday, October 14, according to UNICEF chief Catherine Russell.
     
            Posting to X on Thursday, Russell said this round will aim to vaccinate around 590,000 children under the age of 10.
     
        “Area-specific humanitarian pauses have been agreed,” Russell said. “It’s critical that these pauses are respected by all parties. Without them, it is impossible to vaccinate the children.”
     
 
            She added: “With the additional vaccine equipment & cold boxes that arrived yesterday, UNICEF is ready to deliver & vaccinate children to stop the transmission of polio. The success of the first round shows that when agreements are respected, we can get the job done.”
     
Remember: The first round of the campaign vaccinated more than 560,000 children under age 10 in Gaza last month, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN’s agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, said aid workers reached more than 90% of the targeted vaccine coverage in the initial phase.
     
            Relief workers had described repeated challenges to the campaign rollout – especially in northern Gaza – citing Israeli evacuation orders, roads damaged by bombardment, increased hostilities and scant fuel supplies.
     
            Iranians in Tehran appeared calm and defiant as their country braces for what Israel promises will be a severe response to a missile attack at the Jewish state last week.
     
        “Israel is nothing,” Ali Mousavi said in Tajreesh, a bustling market and site of the Imamzadeh Saleh mosque and shrine, one of north Tehran’s most important pilgrimage sites.“50,000 innocent people have been killed by Israel, why? What does the US want in our region?”
     
 
            Hamid Ashuri said US support for Israel has only emboldened the Jewish state. “In this case, we are not against just Israel. It is against the West,” Ashuri said. “If the US didn’t support Israel, they wouldn’t dare to do anything.”
     
            In the market in northern Tehran, Mohadesse Naderi, a young woman, emphasized that she wants good relations with American people, but insisted that change has to come from US politicians, not Iran.
     
            But Ali Mousavi, speaking loudly, said Iran would stand firm against the US.
     
        “Never threaten an Iranian. We have nothing to do with the US. We are friends with the whole world. We shake hands with everyone in friendship, but we will not tolerate bullying.”
     
 
Remember: Israel’s security cabinet is set to vote Thursday on a response to Iran’s missile attack on October 1, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            Iran has vowed a strong response, should Israel strike Iranian territory and has urged the US not to get involved in its standoff with Israel.
     
            Israel’s security cabinet is set to vote on a response to Iran’s missile attack, a source told CNN. Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel on October 1, an attack it said was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Elsewhere, an Israeli strike has killed at least 28 people in a school in central Gaza. The overall death toll of Palestinians in Gaza is now over 42,000, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.
     
Below are the latest updates:
 
            Israeli security services thwarted a planned bomb attack on the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv by a group believed to be linked to ISIS, they said on Thursday.
     
            Israel Police and the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) said in a joint statement that five residents of the city of Tayibe, north of Tel Aviv and close to the West Bank, had been plotting the attack for weeks.
     
            A month-long covert investigation led to the arrest of the cell’s two leaders, both of whom have ties to ISIS, the police and ISA said in their statement.
     
            Israel Police reported that the suspects had been planning to travel to ISIS combat zones abroad, establish connections with foreign operatives, and that they had already recruited three additional Israeli residents.
     
            Additionally, Israeli police said that during the investigation, authorities discovered that the suspects had been watching videos of bombings in Syria and discussing the amount of explosive material required to destroy the Azrieli Towers in Tel Aviv.
     
            Police added they intervened and arrested the group before their plans could materialize.
     
            A video shared by Israel Police of the arrest operation showed soldiers storming a house and arresting three people. At the end of the video, a still photo shows an Uzi machine gun in a plastic bag.
     
            ISIS is not known to have claimed responsibility for the plot.
     
            “I’m in disbelief,” the mayor of Dardghaya Edmond Ellie told CNN.
     
            “I was just on the phone with Joseph Badawi yesterday. He was a local policeman and a volunteer at the civil defense. He was supposed to evacuate his family from the area.”
     
            Badawi is one of five civil defense volunteers killed in an Israeli airstrike that destroyed the Civil Defense building in the Christian village of Dardghaya on the outskirts of the southern city of Tyre, the rescue group said. The volunteers were on duty to receive SOS calls to help those who had come under fire in the area, the statement said.
     
            Israeli strikes also severely damaged a church hall in the village on the same night, according to the mayor. It was unclear if it was hit in the same strike that destroyed the Civil Defense center.
     
            The mayor, who spoke to CNN from Beirut, verified social media picture of the destroyed church hall, saying the two-floor building was destroyed.
     
            A local official shared a video of the aftermath filmed Thursday morning. “This is where the Civil Defense building was. Nothing is left of it,” said the official, who didn’t want to be named for security reasons.
     
            Video showed the building reduced to a mound of rubble.
     
            Dozens of Palestinians, including children, with severe injuries and burns were transferred to nearby hospitals after an Israeli airstrike on the Rafidah school-turned-shelter in central Gaza killed at least 28 people Thursday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
     
            CNN footage showed children being carried into ambulances, their faces covered with blood, and many of them screaming and crying. One girl lay on the hospital floor, wearing only underpants, shaking and covered in blood, with severe burns on her body.
     
        Am I going to die?” the girl asked medical workers at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. “What happened?”
     
 
            The Israeli military told CNN it struck “terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center” at the school compound. CNN cannot independently verify the statement.
     
            The strike tore down the walls of the school, covering its rooms with blackened debris. Responders and survivors dug through the wreckage trying to recover bodies.
     
            Ayman Abou Khousa, a displaced Palestinian who was sheltering at the school, said the attack came “by surprise.”
     
            “We are dying every day,” he told CNN. “The world has sold us out… every day you (journalists) come here and film us. You’ve been filming us for a year.”
     
            Another man said that survivors are looking for their relatives “in pieces.”
     
            “Why are they hitting the school? It is all displaced people, mostly women,” Iftekhar Hammouda, another woman who was sheltering at the school, said, adding that “there is no Hamas” there.
     
            “Where can people go? Where do they flee? They hit us at our homes, at our tents, on the streets and at the schools.”
     
            The number of unaccompanied or separated children in Gaza since Israel’s war began could be as many as 51,000, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC).
     
            Around 17,000 children were estimated to be unaccompanied or separated from their parents according to the charity in June, but new IRC research published on Wednesday has suggested that this figure could now be three times higher.
     
            The IRC said the risk of family separation has increased dramatically in recent months due to multiple rounds of displacements, arrests, evacuation orders and fatalities, with children found living alone in hospitals – raising concerns about the high risks of child exploitation, neglect, starvation and mental health impacts.
     
            The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spawned a humanitarian crisis of severe hunger, disease and mass displacement. At least 11,355 children have been killed, the UN has estimated. Doctors previously told CNN they use the term “wounded child no surviving family,” to describe Palestinian children who have been orphaned by the war.
     
            Bart Witteveen, the IRC country director for the occupied Palestinian territory, said the international community “must act immediately to safeguard children… not just in the immediate term, but also taking into account their long-term health needs, whether related to mental health, healthcare or education.”
     
        “Children in Gaza cannot wait any longer, prolonged restrictions on humanitarian aid and continued fighting means that a generation of children will now experience life-long health and developmental issues,” he added.

            Two UN peacekeepers were injured in Lebanon on Thursday after an Israeli tank fired toward an observation tower at the headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in the southern Lebanese city Naqoura, according to the mission.
     
            “This morning, two peacekeepers were injured after an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) Merkava tank fired its weapon toward an observation tower at UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura, directly hitting it and causing them to fall. The injuries are fortunately, this time, not serious, but they remain in hospital,” UNFIL said, adding that its headquarters and nearby positions “have been repeatedly hit.”
     
            Israeli soldiers also fired at another UN position in Ras Naqoura hitting the entrance to the bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering damaging vehicles and a communications system, the mission added.
     
What is UNIFIL? The UN’s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon was established by the UN Security Council in 1978, following the Israeli invasion of the country’s south. The agency established the Blue Line – an area spanning 120 kilometers along southern Lebanon – in 2000, in order to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.
     
            On Wednesday, a UNIFIL spokesperson told CNN that Israeli invasions were ongoing “a bit everywhere in the proximity” of the Blue Line, as the Israeli military expands operations across southern Lebanon.

            A man has died after he was wounded in a stabbing attack in the city of Hadera, in northern Israel, on Wednesday, according to a hospital official.
     
            “Unfortunately, despite the extensive efforts of the medical staff, the death of the critically injured patient has been confirmed, we share in the family’s sorrow,” a Hillel Yaffe Medical Center spokesperson told CNN on Thursday
     
            The man was one of five people who had been targeted on Wednesday during a “terror attack” in the Haifa district, Israeli police said, adding that the suspect was “neutralized by an armed citizen” at the scene.
     
            The man, 35, is a father of six, according to Israeli media. At least two other victims, aged 50 and 70, remained in serious condition, Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency service, reported.
     
            Israel’s minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir offered “a prayer for the healing of the wounded” after the attack.
     
            Efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Lebanon have intensified over the past few hours, according to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati’s office, adding that contact between the United States and France is ongoing to revive a ceasefire proposal between Hezbollah and Israel.
     
            US President Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron proposed a 21-day ceasefire during the UN General Assembly last month. Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah three days after the proposal and launched intensive attacks on the group, derailing the talks.
     
            Netanyahu publicly rejected a ceasefire ahead of the assassination. Prospects for a truce diminished further after Iran, who backs Hezbollah, fired a barrage of missiles on Israel last week.
     
            “There are contacts taking place between the United States and France…with the aim of reviving the declaration of a ceasefire for a specific period in order to resume the search for political solutions,” Mikati’s office said on X, citing the prime minister.
     
            Mikati said his government is ready to implement the 2006 Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a permanent ceasefire and end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution also stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw north of the Litani River in Lebanon, and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area.
     
            Hezbollah’s top official Naim Qassem said Tuesday that his group backs ceasefire efforts spearheaded by Shia allies inside Lebanon. This was the first time the group publicly endorsed a truce and didn’t condition it on stopping the war in Gaza.
     
            At least 42,065 Palestinians have been killed and another 97,886 injured since Israel launched its war in Gaza on October 7, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.
     
            In the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes in the strip killed at least 55 Palestinians and wounded 166 people, the ministry reported on Thursday.
     
            An Israeli airstrike killed at least 28 Palestinians and wounded dozens more people at a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Thursday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
     
            The attack on the Rafida school injured at least 54 Palestinians, according to the Red Crescent.
     
            Hospital officials earlier put the toll at 16, saying it hit people sheltering at the site.
     
            The Israeli military said it struck “terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center” at the school compound. CNN cannot independently verify the statement.

            The director of one of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza has issued a desperate plea against an Israeli military order to evacuate, warning that it puts children’s lives at severe risk.
     
            In a video message shared with CNN, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said the facility’s intensive care unit is already treating more children than it was designed for and that the severity of the conditions means nowhere could accommodate them if they were to evacuate.
     
        “All cases are critical and reliant on oxygen,” Abu Safiya said. “There is no place that can accommodate this number of patients dependent on ventilators in the Gaza Strip.”
     
 
        “I appeal to all international and humanitarian organizations and the international community to stop the occupation from carrying out its decisions to evacuate Kamal Adwan Hospital and to halt its operations,” he said, warning that the closure of the hospital would mean “stopping life for these children.”
     
 
            Since Sunday, the Israeli military has issued evacuation orders for large areas in northern Gaza — including Beit Hanoun, Jabalya, and Beit Lahia — saying it launched a new ground offensive there to combat efforts by Hamas to rebuild its capabilities in the area.
     
            Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital, each already only partially functioning, have been ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military, according to both Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
     
            Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians and injured more than 97,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures.
     
            According to the United Nations, an estimated 11,355 children are among those killed, with the health ministry in Gaza saying previously that many of the dead are women and children.
     
            Israel must urgently address the “catastrophic conditions” in Gaza, the US envoy to the United Nations said Wednesday, as she warned that “actions by the Israeli government to limit the delivery of aid” would intensify suffering.
     
            Though predicted months ago, the dire conditions in the enclave had yet to be addressed, US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council.
     
            “Conditions are catastrophic and will further deteriorate if additional steps are not taken,”  Thomas-Greenfield said, according to remarks released by her office.
     
        “That must change, and now. We call on Israel to take urgent steps to do so.”
     
 
            More than 41,000 people have been killed in Israel’s year-long bombardment of Gaza, which has decimated the health care system and spawned a humanitarian crisis for 1.9 million displaced Palestinians.
     
            Thomas-Greenfield also said the US is “deeply concerned” by draft Israeli legislation that would declare the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), the main UN agency in Gaza, a “terrorist” organization and bar it from operating in Israel.
     
            Israel’s security cabinet will convene on Thursday to vote on the country’s response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            Earlier, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel’s response to Iran would be “powerful, precise, and above all – surprising.”
     
            Israel’s military said it launched new strikes on Lebanon overnight, targeting what it said were Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in the capital’s southern suburbs and the south of the country.
     
            Two Hezbollah commanders responsible for missile attacks on northern Israel were also “eliminated” in the strikes, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
     
            Hezbollah is yet to comment, and the extent of the damage remains unclear.
     
            More than 1,500 people have been killed and 1.2 million displaced in Lebanon since Israel launched its ground incursion and intensified airstrikes this month, according to Lebanese authorities.
     
            In its statement, the Israeli military said it gave advance warning to civilians prior to the strikes on Dahiyeh, southern Beirut. The IDF issued evacuation orders for specific buildings in the Haret Hreik and Hadath areas of the Hezbollah stronghold on Wednesday, saying it would soon target those sites.
     
        On Thursday, the IDF claimed that Hezbollah had “deliberately embedded its weapons storage facilities and weaponry beneath residential buildings, schools, mosques, and universities, in the heart of Beirut, endangering the civilian population in the area.”
     
 
            More than 1,500 people in Lebanon have been killed and over 8,000 injured since Israel escalated its war on Hezbollah last month, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            Some 1.2 million people have been displaced in the country since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have previously said, as the humanitarian crisis grows and Israel expands its military operations.
     
            A quarter of Lebanon is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the United Nations.
     
            An Israeli strike hit an industrial area south of the Syrian city of Homs, according to Syria’s state-run news agency.
     
            SANA reported that the strike on Thursday hit the city of Hassia, around 35 kilometers (22 miles) from Homs and near the border with Lebanon.
     
        “Material damage occurred at a factory in the city of Hassia,” the agency reported, saying the strike targeted “the city and a military site in the Hama countryside.”
     
 
            The agency, citing a military source, said the attack was launched around 1 a.m. local time from the direction of northern Lebanon and targeted a car factory.
     
            “Losses from the attack were limited to material damage only,” the agency said, citing the source.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
Some context: Israel has carried out numerous attacks on Syria in recent weeks, targeting what it says are Hezbollah figures and infrastructure used to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.
     
            On Tuesday, at least seven people were killed and 11 wounded by an Israeli attack on a residential building in Syria’s capital Damascus, according to SANA. CNN geolocated the building and found it is near many diplomatic facilities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to comment.
     
            Last Friday, the Israeli military said it struck an underground tunnel crossing the Lebanese border into Syria that was used by Hezbollah to transport weapons “from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
     
            Hezbollah is part of an Iran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since Israel’s war with Hamas began a year ago.
     
            As the Middle East braces for Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the strike would be “powerful, precise, and above all – surprising.”
     
            His remarks come as the White House said US President Joe Biden held a “direct,” 30-minute phone call with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu — their first conversation in almost two months, a sign of how fraught relations have become and how distant the two leaders are in their objectives for the region.
     
            The White House characterized the conversation as an extension of discussions between US and Israeli officials about Israel’s response to Iran. It did not provide any further details about Israel’s planned retaliation, which Biden has said should be “proportional.”
     
Here’s what else you need to know:
 
            A quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the United Nations, a sign of the growing scale of the humanitarian crisis and expansion of Israel’s war against Hezbollah.
     
        “Lebanon’s humanitarian crisis is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Israeli airstrikes have not only intensified but also expanded into previously unaffected areas and increasingly targeted critical civilian infrastructure,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a situation update released Wednesday.
     
 
        “Displacement orders for more than 100 villages and urban neighborhoods across southern Lebanon continue to force people to flee,” the report said.
     
 
            On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued new evacuation orders for specific buildings in the Haret Hreik and Hadath areas of Dahiyeh, a southern suburb of Beirut and Hezbollah stronghold, saying it would soon target those sites.
     
More context: Israel has carried out more than 1,100 airstrikes on southern Lebanon since its ground operations began earlier this month, the IDF said Wednesday.
     
            CNN teams in Beirut reported earlier that many Israeli strikes have hit without warning and that Israel sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are asleep.
     
            More than 1,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel escalated its war on Hezbollah, according to the Lebanese health ministry. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have said.
     
            The country’s health sector has been put under “immense pressure of relentless attacks” on health facilities and personnel and its education sector faces “enormous challenges,” the OCHA report said, with most schools having been repurposed into shelters.
     
            A United Nations official warned that its humanitarian response in Gaza “may disintegrate” if the UN agency for Palestinian refugees were to be banned from Israeli territory, citing legislation moving through the Israeli parliament (Knesset).
     
        “If the bills are adopted, the consequences will be severe,” Philippe Lazzarini, Commissioner-General of UNRWA, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday.
     
 
            “Operationally, the entire humanitarian response in Gaza – which rests on UNRWA’s infrastructure – may disintegrate,” he said, adding that “senior Israeli officials have described destroying UNRWA as a war goal.”
     
What’s happening: On Sunday, the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Security Committee moved forward a group of bills which seek to ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from operating in Israeli territory and to forbid any state authority from having any contact with the agency, according to a Knesset statement on X.
     
            “Politically, the anti-UNRWA legislation, which is part of a broader campaign to dismantle the agency, seeks to strip Palestinians from their refugee status, and change – unilaterally – the parameters for a future political solution,” Lazzarini said.
     
Remember: The Israeli government in January accused some UNRWA staff members of involvement in the October 7 attacks on Israel. The Israeli government did not make their evidence public, nor – according to UNRWA – did they share it with the agency. UNWRA in January said it had terminated the accused employees’ contracts.
     
Added context: Israel’s relations with the UN have sunk to historic lows in the past year, with senior UN officials highly critical of Israel’s war conduct in Gaza. Israeli officials have long criticized UNRWA, which plays a central role in feeding and sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees.
     
            In the past 12 months, 226 UNRWA personnel have been killed in Gaza and two-thirds of its buildings have been damaged or destroyed, Lazzarini said.
     
            Israel has carried out more than 1,100 airstrikes on southern Lebanon since its ground war began earlier this month, its military announced on Wednesday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement it had attacked “munitions warehouses, launchers, tunnel shafts and observation and sniping positions” in the airstrikes.
     
            IDF aircraft and ground forces are working closely together to multiply force and help “neutralize threats,” it continued.
     
            The start of Lebanon’s new school year has been postponed to November 4 “as 75% of the country’s public schools have been converted into shelters,” a United Nations official said Wednesday as he spoke about the impact Israel’s escalating offensive against Hezbollah is having on the country.
     
        “The impact of the conflict on children is immense,” UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon Imran Riza told a press briefing Wednesday.
     
 
            “More than 600,000 people” are internally displaced across the country, over half of them women and girls, he said.
     
            Of that figure, “at least 350,000” are children, he said of the evolving humanitarian crisis in which more than 300,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, “crossing over to Syria, and many of them moving on to Iraq or Turkey as well.”
     
            Meanwhile, 185,000 people are seeking refuge in 1,000 shelters, “80% of which are already fully at capacity,” Riza said.
     
            Riza said thousands of others are being displaced “by orders issued with little notice and often past midnight, are left to sleep on the streets or (do) not really know where to go.”
     
Remember: CNN teams in Beirut have reported that many Israeli strikes happened without warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping.
     
            US President Joe Biden held a “direct,” 30-minute phone call with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months and a chance to confer over Israel’s planned response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack.
     
        “They discussed a range of issues,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said after the call ended, characterizing the conversation as an extension of discussions between US and Israeli officials about Israel’s response to the Iranian attack, which Biden has said should be “proportional.”
     
 
            Yet neither she nor a short White House description of the call, sent a few hours afterward, provided any further details about Israel’s planned retaliation for last week’s missile barrage.
     
            A White House readout described Biden condemning “unequivocally” the Iranian missile attack, without expanding any further on the two leaders’ discussion of Israel’s response, which was the reason for the call and which Biden has said should not include an attack on Iranian nuclear sites.
     
            That the two leaders went 49 days without speaking amid rapidly escalating tensions in the Middle East was a sign of how fraught the relationship has become, and how distant the two leaders have become in their objectives for the region.
     
            Biden has grown frustrated that Netanyahu appears to brush off his advice and recommendations, and to publicly reject his attempts at lowering regional temperatures. Some American officials have privately speculated the Israeli leader is looking to boost Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the weeks ahead of November’s election.
     
Read more about the leaders’ fraught relationship.
 
            Israel will continue to “strike Hezbollah with intensity, without allowing them any respite or recovery,” according to the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that Hezbollah had been weakened and was “making efforts to conceal the significant damage” it had suffered.
     
        “They are experiencing command and control difficulties, leading to confusion at the decision-making level and challenges in their operational capabilities,” Halevi said.
     
 
            The Israeli military announced earlier Wednesday that Israel has carried out more than 1,100 airstrikes on southern Lebanon since its ground operations began earlier this month.
     
            Also speaking on Wednesday, Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said the recent Iranian attacks on Israel had been “aggressive” but ultimately “failed” since no military assets were damaged.
     
        On the prospect of Israeli retaliation, Gallant said: “Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened.”

            The Israeli military is being accused of firing at a group of journalists in Gaza on Wednesday, killing one person and injuring others, according to Al Jazeera and medical responders.
     
            Al Jazeera said that the Israeli military “targeted a number of journalists” who were working in and near the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza.
     
            The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said that it transported one injured journalist and the body of a person who was killed to the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City after Israeli forces “targeted a group of journalists at Abu Sharkh roundabout in the northern Gaza Strip.”
     
            However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN it was “not aware of IDF troops in the specified area” at that time.
     
            Al Jazeera said in a statement that Fadi Al Wahidi, a photojournalist for Al Jazeera, was shot in the neck causing “critical injury.” His condition is now stable, according to one of Al Wahidi’s colleagues, Mohammad Qareqe’e.
     
            Two employees of Al Aqsa, a TV channel affiliated with Hamas, were also shot, Al Aqsa said. One photojournalist, Mohammed Al-Tanani, was killed and a reporter was injured, according to Al Aqsa.
     
            Footage from the scene shows Al Wahidi being carried by a group of men, many of them wearing press vests. Blood is visible on his shirt.
     
            “This incident marks yet another grave violation against journalists in Gaza, where Israeli forces have been increasingly hostile toward media workers,” Al Jazeera said. “The deliberate targeting of journalists is a flagrant violation of international laws protecting the press and humanitarian workers in war zones.”
     
            At least 128 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war, nearly all of them Palestinian media workers in Gaza killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders.
     
            The Government Media Office in Gaza in a statement Wednesday condemned “in the strongest terms the targeting, killing and assassination of Palestinian journalists.”
     
            Four members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades were killed in an Israeli special forces operation in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank, on Wednesday, the group confirmed.
     
            Among those killed were field commander Issam Muhammad al-Salaj, one of its leaders in Balata, and field commander Abdul Halim Muhammad Nasser, a leader in Askar, according to the Brigades, a network of Palestinian armed groups.
     
            The group condemned the attack in which Israeli special forces shot at the Palestinians’ car in Nablus, calling it a “cowardly assassination.”
     
            It’s been two days since fishing boats have left the Tyre port. An Israeli military warning on Monday against operating vessels on the southern Lebanese coast left fisherman here with nothing to do but watch their moored small boats or try their luck with a fishing rod.
     
            “We used to go to the sea to eat, now the sea is off limits. How can we eat?” Abu Ibrahim asked CNN at a seaside cafe. His family is in Beirut in one of the schools-turned-shelters for the displaced.
     
            “Where else can we go? There are no shops open,” he added.
     
            The handful of cafes and bars around the port are the only sign of life in what’s become largely a ghost town. Repeated Israeli strikes on the city and its suburbs pushed out residents and the internally displaced people that had previously sought refuge there.
     
            Earlier Israeli warnings against driving south meant that little supplies are reaching Tyre. Most of the shops and restaurants around the city are shuttered.
     
            “Everyone comes here. This a safe spot,” Tony Khatouki, a passerby, told CNN.
     
            He argued that the seaport is its own bubble in a city bearing the fresh scars of an ongoing war.
     
            Lebanon’s Civil Defense service says five of its members have been killed by an Israeli airstrike in the southern city of Tyre.
     
            The workers were taking emergency calls when the strike hit the Civil Defense Center in the town of Dardghaya, it said in a statement.
     
            Lebanon’s Civil Defense is the public emergency medical service of Lebanon.
     
            The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the attack in a post on X, saying Israel was guilty of targeting “rescue and ambulance crews (and) disregarding international laws, norms and humanitarian conventions.”
     
            US President Joe Biden held a “direct” 30-minute phone call with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, according to press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This was their first conversation in almost two months, and comes as Israel considers its response to Iran’s missile strikes on October 1.
     
            Elsewhere, Israel has announced it has carried out over 1,100 airstrikes on southern Lebanon since the start of its ground operations, while the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has pledged Israel will continue its war on Hezbollah “with intensity, without allowing them any respite or recovery.”
     
Below are the latest updates:
 
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has claimed that the hospital it struck in Gaza’s Jabalya refugee camp earlier on Wednesday was a “command and control center used by Hamas terrorists.”
     
            At least 16 people were killed and 17 injured in the attack on the grounds of the Al-Yemen Al-Sa’eed Hospital in Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, hospital officials have said.
     
            When asked by CNN about the attack, the IDF said that it “struck terrorists.”
     
            “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions,” the IDF said.
     
            US President Joe Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the need for diplomatic solutions to conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, the White House said Wednesday, with the two leaders agreeing “to remain in close contact over the coming days both directly and through their national security teams.
     
        “On Lebanon, the president emphasized the need for a diplomatic arrangement to safely return both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line,” the White House said. 
     
 
            “The president affirmed Israel’s right to protect its citizens from Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of missiles and rockets into Israel over the past year alone, while emphasizing the need to minimize harm to civilians, in particular in the densely populated areas of Beirut.”
     
            CNN reported earlier this week that the administration has focused on attempting to limit Israeli operations in Lebanon rather than halting hostilities, two weeks after Israel upended a US-led ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah.
     
            “On Gaza, the leaders discussed the urgent need to renew diplomacy to release the hostages held by Hamas. The president also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the imperative to restore access to the north, including by reinvigorating the corridor from Jordan immediately,” the White House said.
     
            Earlier Wednesday, Biden told rabbis on a call marking the Jewish High Holidays he conveyed his condolences to Netanyahu on the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attack.
     
            The start of Lebanon’s new school year has been postponed to November 4 “as 75% of the country’s public schools have been converted into shelters,” a United Nations official said Wednesday as he spoke about the impact Israel’s escalating offensive against Hezbollah is having on the country.
     
        “The impact of the conflict on children is immense,” UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon Imran Riza told a press briefing Wednesday.
     
 
            “More than 600,000 people” are internally displaced across the country, over half of them women and girls, he said.
     
            Of that figure, “at least 350,000” are children, he said of the evolving humanitarian crisis in which more than 300,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, “crossing over to Syria, and many of them moving on to Iraq or Turkey as well.”
     
            Meanwhile, 185,000 people are seeking refuge in 1,000 shelters, “80% of which are already fully at capacity,” Riza said.
     
            Riza said thousands of others are being displaced “by orders issued with little notice and often past midnight, are left to sleep on the streets or (do) not really know where to go.”
     
Remember: CNN teams in Beirut have reported that many Israeli strikes happened without warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping.
     
            Israel will continue to “strike Hezbollah with intensity, without allowing them any respite or recovery,” according to the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that Hezbollah had been weakened and was “making efforts to conceal the significant damage” it had suffered.
     
        “They are experiencing command and control difficulties, leading to confusion at the decision-making level and challenges in their operational capabilities,” Halevi said.
     
 
            Also speaking on Wednesday, Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said the recent Iranian attacks on Israel had been “aggressive” but ultimately “failed” since no military assets were damaged.
     
            On the prospect of Israeli retaliation, Gallant said: “Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened.”
     
Remember: The Israeli military announced earlier Wednesday that Israel has carried out more than 1,100 airstrikes on southern Lebanon since its ground operations began earlier this month.
     
            US President Joe Biden joined a call marking the Jewish High Holidays Wednesday, in which he expressed his support for Israel, touting “unprecedented action … to successfully assist in the successful defense of Israel,” following attacks by Iran and its proxies, while nodding to the at-times tense relationship between Israel’s leadership and the US.
     
            “You’ve heard me say before that I got very badly criticized as a young senator, saying, ‘I’m a Zionist.’ You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, that’s not necessary, and the idea, I firmly believe, without an Israel, every Jew in the world’s security is less stable – I mean that,” Biden said.
     
            “It doesn’t mean that Jewish leadership doesn’t have to be more progressive than it is, but it does mean it has to exist, and that’s what worries me most about what’s going on now.”
     
Remember: Earlier Wednesday, the White House said Biden held a “direct” 30-minute call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with the two leaders discussing “a range of issues,” including Israel’s response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack.
     
            “I just spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu for about an hour this morning, and offered my condolences on this somber one-year anniversary,” Biden said on Wednesday’s call.
     
            US President Joe Biden held a “direct,” 30-minute phone call with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months and a chance to confer over Israel’s planned response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack.
     
            “They discussed a range of issues,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said after the call ended, promising a more fulsome readout later Wednesday afternoon.
     
            She characterized the conversation as an extension of discussions between US and Israeli officials about Israel’s response to the Iranian attack, which Biden has said should be “proportional.”
     
            But otherwise, Jean-Pierre was tight-lipped about the phone call, which occurred midmorning. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call from New York on a secure phone line.
     
            Harris declined to elaborate on the conversation in an interview with CNN earlier Wednesday, telling Dana Bash it was classified. Still, she acknowledged the significance of the conversation, the first between Biden and Netanyahu since August 21.
     
            “It was an important call,” she said.
     
Open question: American officials have been hoping to limit Israel’s response to Iran, with the region on a razor’s edge as fears of a wider war grow. The president has said he opposes strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and recommended against a strike on Iranian oil reserves.
     
            How much weight Biden’s words will carry is an open question, however, and US officials have grown highly skeptical at Netanyahu’s willingness to listen to Biden’s advice.
     
            Israel has carried out more than 1,100 airstrikes on southern Lebanon since its ground war began earlier this month, its military announced on Wednesday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement it had attacked “munitions warehouses, launchers, tunnel shafts and observation and sniping positions” in the airstrikes.
     
            IDF aircraft and ground forces are working closely together to multiply force and help “neutralize threats,” it continued.
     
            The United States continues to assess that Israel’s ground operations in Lebanon are “limited,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday, noting that the “limited” refers to distance from the border not number of Israeli troops on the ground.
     
            “We have seen so far on the ground, limited ground incursions. But as you heard me say previous times at this podium, we are also cognizant of the long history of Israel starting with limited ground operations in Lebanon, turning those into more full-scale ground operations, turning those into occupation, something that we are very clear we are opposed to,” Miller told a State Department briefing.
     
            “We’re going to continue to have the conversations with the government of Israel about that, because I think it’s quite obvious that there is a point at which what they’re doing now turns into something different that has obvious political effects inside Lebanon, as well as humanitarian effects on the Lebanese people,” he added.
     
            Miller described “limited operations” as “Israeli troops going a short distance across the border, conducting operations, not pushing deep inside Lebanon.”
     
            Tens of thousands of people have already been displaced from southern Lebanon amid increasing Israeli military operations.
     
            The Israeli military dropped highly destructive 2,000-pound bombs in “dangerous proximities” to nearly all Gaza’s hospitals during the early weeks of its war in the enclave, according to a peer-reviewed study published Wednesday, which cites a CNN investigation.
     
            Between October 7 and November 17, 2023, Israel deployed 2,000-pound bombs within the “lethal range” of 25% of all hospitals in Gaza, according to an analysis of impact craters by researchers at Harvard and other universities.
     
            The analysis also found impact craters from the bombs within the “infrastructure damage and injury range” of more than 83% of hospitals – 30 out of 36 – in the strip.
     
            The report, published in the journal PLOS Global Public Health, comes as Israel orders the evacuation of three hospitals in northern Gaza amid a renewed military operation in the area. The Gaza health ministry has called for all medical institutions to be protected.
     
            The use of 2,000-pound bombs in such close proximity to hospitals in late 2023 was a “clear violation of international humanitarian law, with tools that the US is supplying,” Dennis Kunichoff, a data analyst at Harvard University and lead author of the study, told CNN.
     
        “When they [the bombs] hit the ground, they release about 1,000 pounds of shrapnel … at incredible speed,” he said. “Essentially, the force and the shrapnel can kill people and damage concrete infrastructure from hundreds of meters away.”
     
 
            Responding to a request for comment on the findings, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “allegations that the IDF fires indiscriminately undermines the significant and unprecedented efforts made by the IDF to accurately strike military infrastructure, objectives, and operatives.” The IDF added that it follows international law and “does not target civilian objects and civilians.”
     
            The United States government has had “very urgent discussions” with the Israeli government about the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza and the need to comply with international humanitarian law, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday.
     
        “We are incredibly concerned about the humanitarian situation in all of Gaza, and particularly concerned about the humanitarian situation in North Gaza, and I can tell you, it has been the subject of some very urgent discussions between our two governments,” Miller told a press briefing.
     
 
            “We have been making clear to the government of Israel that they have an obligation under international humanitarian law to allow food and water and other needed humanitarian assistance to make it into all parts of Gaza, and we fully expect them to comply with those obligations,” he said.
     
            Notably, Miller said the US still does not assess that Israel is intentionally withholding humanitarian aid, which would be a violation of US and international law.  However, he suggested that a change in policy is not off the table, saying that “it is urgent that they correct the situation and allow humanitarian aid to get in.”
     
            Miller would not say how the Israeli government responded to the conversations.
     
Remember: Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed at least 41,965 Palestinians and injured another 97,590, according to the Ministry of Health there, and triggered a dire humanitarian crisis in the enclave. Many of Israel’s strikes have hit civilian infrastructure.
     
            Israel has for years said Hamas fighters use mosques, hospitals and other civilian buildings to hide from Israeli attacks and launch their own. Hamas has repeatedly denied the claims.
     
            More than 1,100 US citizens, legal permanent residents and their family members have left Lebanon on US-organized flights, up from over 1,000 yesterday, as Israel intensifies its war with Hezbollah, according to a State Department spokesperson.
     
            One flight left last night and another this morning from Beirut to Istanbul, according to State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller, with “a total of 50 people on the flight this morning” and “around 13, 14” people on the flight last night.
     
            Though neither of the flights were near their capacity of 300 per plane, Miller said the US would continue the flights as “we do assess that there is demand.”
     
        “We’ve had some flights go out with around 150 people, and we’ve had these other flights with fewer, but it is going to be an ongoing question we look at, an ongoing assessment that we make,” said Miller, who added that part of the assessment involved the availability of commercial flights out of the country.
     
 
            The US has reserved a total of around 1,000 seats for American citizens, legal permanent residents and their family members on commercial flights, up from 900 yesterday.
     
        “When you add the number of seats on commercial flights that are we have been making available, there have been a total of 4,600 seats that we have been able to make available to American citizens, permanent residents and family members,” said Miller.
     
 
            Bahaa Sahel picks up items from her damaged shop in Tyre, southern Lebanon. Clothes, footwear and accessories fill a yellow plastic bag too heavy for her to carry over the rubble.
     
            Tyre, Lebanon’s fourth-largest city, has been pummelled by Israeli airstrikes in recent weeks as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a ground operation into the country’s south.
     
            “We fled the town two hours earlier. If I had stayed, I would have been here,” Bahaa says, pointing to the heaps of crumbled cement behind her.
     
            Two Israeli missiles leveled three adjacent buildings killing at least five people, her neighbors explain.
     
            Hassan, who owns a café down the road, says when the first missile hit, he saw a building blow up in the air. It happened 10 days ago, but he says he is still shaken and traumatized.
     
            The blast destroyed vehicles and threw a couple of cars across the street.
     
            Bahaa only got back to her shop and home street on Wednesday to save what she could of her shop before the expected rain. It is a chance to mourn the friends she lost.
     
            “I’ve owned and run this shop for 35 years. These were my neighbors, my friends. I knew the mother, the father and their children,” she says.
     
            It’s not her first war, but she’s praying it will be the last.
     
            “During the Israeli invasion in 1982, a three-story building collapsed over our heads. My cousin died, but God saved my sister and me,” she recalls. She has a similar story for every war Lebanon has gone through.
     
            “So many tragedies,” she says. “I don’t know how many more wars we would live through. But history repeats itself.”
     
            Bahaa and her sister walk over the rubble to reach her apartment two blocks down the road. She says she’s leaving again to the mountains near Beirut the following morning even though the sounds of Israeli airstrikes on the capital scare her every night.
     
            “Maybe this war would be the last one. Maybe God would have mercy on us. We can’t take it anymore,” she says.
     
            The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) told CNN on Wednesday of “IDF [Israel Defense Force] invasions a bit everywhere in the proximity of the Blue Line,” in southern Lebanon.
     
            On Wednesday, Hezbollah said in a statement that it had hit a group of Israeli soldiers with a suicide drone after they tried to enter Lebanon from Ras al-Naqoura, the western-most point of the Blue Line, which marks a buffer zone separating the two countries that is monitored by UNIFIL peacekeepers.
     
            Asked about the incident, a UNIFIL spokesperson confirmed the organization is observing clashes in the direction of Labbouneh, around 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) east of Naqoura. They added, however, that UNIFIL’s “monitoring capabilities are very limited” due to heavy shelling preventing their units from getting close to the area.
     
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
     
            UNIFIL has a significantly large base in the border town of Naqoura, where the Force Commander and Head of Mission Lt. Gen. Lazaro is based, with around 1,000 staff officers and civilian staff, according to the spokesperson.
     
            Hezbollah fighters had already clashed with Israeli forces near Naqoura earlier on Wednesday. Although other Israeli incursions have been reported along the border, Wednesday marks the first time the IDF is attempting to invade Lebanon from this location since the start of this ground war.
     
            Earlier, the Israeli military told CNN there are “counter-terrorism activities” ongoing in Lebanon but has not commented on specific incidents.
     
            Five Palestinian men were killed by Israeli special forces who shot at their car in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
     
            A video obtained by CNN shows at least four men standing behind a car while holding assault rifles and shooting at a second car across from them. In a separate video bystanders are seen rushing to the scene after the gunmen left. Another video shows the interior of the car filled with blood.
     
            In a joint statement, the Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency said they killed five people, including the head of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades – a network of Palestinian armed groups – in Balata.
     
            The statement said those killed were “wanted for terrorist activities” and were “involved in exporting and planning terrorist activities against civilians and IDF forces.”
     
            The Palestinian Ministry of Health named the killed men as: Abdul Halim Muhammad Nasser, Salim Izz al-Din Mahmoud Abu Saada, Naeem Muhammad Raji Abdul Hadi and Issam Muhammad Suleiman Salah.
     
            Hamas condemned the attack in a statement calling on residents of the occupied West Bank to mobilize in “mass angry marches” and “escalate the confrontation and clash with the occupation and its settler gangs in all areas”.
     
Remember: There has been a surge in Israeli settler violence across the occupied West Bank since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza.
     
            The West Bank lies between Israel and Jordan and is home to 3.3 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation, as well as hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis who began settling there some 57 years ago.
     
            Air France has opened an investigation into how a jet flying from Paris to Dubai went over Iraq as Iranian missiles fired at Israel crossed the same airspace, the airline said Wednesday.
     
            Iran launched dozens of missiles towards Israel on October 1 in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others in Lebanon. The missiles had to pass through Iraq’s airspace to reach Israel.
     
Here’s what we know: Air France Flight AF662 was flying over Iraq when the Iranian attack began at around 4:45 p.m. UTC (11.45 a.m. ET) and left Iraqi airspace “shortly before” 5 p.m. UTC (12 p.m. ET), the airline told CNN in a statement.
     
            Iraqi airspace was not officially closed by local authorities until 5:56 p.m. UTC (12:56 p.m. ET), it added.
     
            “Thanks to the information we gathered we were able to identify a forthcoming attack on Israel by Iran, involving the launch of ballistic missiles,” Air France said, adding that as a result the airline suspended the overflight of Iraq’s airspace from 5 p.m. UTC (12 p.m. ET).
     
            French television channel LCI said Air France pilots saw the missiles in the night sky from the cockpit, and that Iraqi air traffic control had wished the pilots “good luck.”
     
            Asked by CNN, an Air France spokesperson would not confirm that the pilots saw missiles fly past.
     
            The incident comes as the conflict in the Middle East further spirals.
     
            Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets at northern Israeli cities on Wednesday, killing two people and marking the first civilian deaths in the area since Israel launched its ground war on Lebanon earlier this month.
     
        “What we feared happened today in Kiryat Shmona. A couple who were walking outside with their dogs were caught in the incident of falling rockets,” Israeli police commander Eli Silok said in a statement.
     
 
            The rocket fell 20 meters (65 feet) away from the couple, impacting them and the dogs, Silok said. Another rocket fell close to an ambulance, damaging it, Ziporra Barak, an emergency responder for Israel’s emergency services (MDA) said.
     
            Fires broke out across several buildings and open fields around the city following the rocket fire, the Israel Fire and Rescue Services said.
     
            Ninety rockets were fired by Hezbollah into the Upper Galilee, Western Galilee and southern Golan Heights on Wednesday afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Some were intercepted but other “fallen projectiles were identified,” the IDF said.
     
            In another Israeli city, Safed, footage showed several interceptors shooting down rockets. Safed Municipality also published video showing damage to a building following a rocket strike. No injuries were reported.
     
            Earlier, Israel’s emergency services said six people were injured after rockets fell on Haifa, the largest city in northern Israel.
     
            Several fires also broke out in buildings and open areas as a result of direct missile hits in the Upper Galilee.
     
Remember: Hezbollah are firing hundreds of rockets as Israel continues what it says are limited operations in southern Lebanon. The IDF posted several videos throughout Wednesday including one that showed a strike on armed fighters emerging from the rubble, and several other strikes on buildings in southern Lebanon.
     
            A phone call between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now over, according to a US official.
     
            The call on Wednesday morning lasted little over an hour, according to the official.
     
        “This morning, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. Vice President Harris also joined the call. A readout of the call will be released soon,” the White House said.
     
 
            Harris has frequently joined previous calls between Biden and Netanyahu, including during their last conversation on August 21st.
     
            According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also joined the call from his plane en route to Laos.
     
            Miller would not share details about the call and deferred to the White House.
     
            Biden and Netanyahu were expected to discuss Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack, according to a person familiar with the plans.
     
This post has been updated with the latest comments from US officials.
 
            Iran‘s capital Tehran is plastered with billboards and posters depicting Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut, Lebanon last month.
     
            The captions vary, some reading: “The beginning of the victory of God,” or “This is the path of jihad. It ends in victory or martyrdom.”
     
            The posters are meant to show the unwavering support of the Islamic Republic’s leadership for Hezbollah in the wake of the Nasrallah killing and as the group struggles under Israeli military pressure.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had close personal relations with Hassan Nasrallah. In a rare appearance leading Friday prayers in Tehran last week, he eulogized Nasrallah, while justifying Iran’s missile strikes against Israel on October 1.
     
            Iran is now bracing for a possible Israeli response and Tehran’s political leadership has threatened a “crushing response,” if Israel hits targets inside Iran.
     
            Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to join a call between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled for Wednesday morning, a source familiar with the plans said.
     
            Harris has frequently joined previous calls between Biden and Netanyahu, including during their last conversation on August 21st.
     
            The call comes a few days after Harris argued the US has had influence on Israel’s decision making. But she also refrained from saying whether she believes the US has a “close ally” in Netanyahu.
     
        “The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire,” Harris said in an interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes.“And we’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.”
     
 
More on the phone call: Biden and Netanyahu are expected to discuss Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack on October 1, according to a person familiar with the plans. 
 
            The conversation will be the first known call between the men in 49 days, a striking period of silence for two counterparts who spoke frequently in the weeks after the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
     
            At least 16 people have been killed and 17 injured after an attack on a hospital within the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, hospital officials have said.
     
            Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, told CNN that the bodies of at least 16 of those killed in the strike had arrived at his facility, many of them burnt.
     
            Abu Saifiya said that tents set up on the grounds of the Al-Yemen Al-Sa’eed Hospital were targeted.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            According to its director, Kamal Adwan Hospital is the only fully functioning medical facility remaining in northern Gaza. The hospital, alongside two others in the enclave’s north, have been ordered to evacuate by Israeli military, according to both Doctors Without Borders and the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
     
Remember: On Sunday, the IDF said that it had “encircled” the Jabalya refugee camp after it said it had detected the presence of Hamas members there.
     
            At least 10 people were killed in a strike on the camp the same day, and a further 20 people were injured, Kamal Adwan Hospital officials said.
     
            On Monday, Abu Saifiya said that the Israeli military had instructed the Kamal Adwan Hospital to evacuate within 24 hours.
     
            A man and a woman were killed from “fatal shrapnel wounds” after rockets struck Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel, the national emergency service Magen David Adom said on Wednesday.
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted “Israeli enemy forces” in the city with rockets in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza and “in defense of Lebanon.”
     
            “Following the sirens that sounded in Kiryat Shmona, approximately 20 projectile launches were identified crossing from Lebanon, fallen projectiles were identified,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
     
            Several buildings caught fire in Kiryat Shmona following the rocket strikes, Israel Fire and Rescue Services said.
     
            Earlier, Hezbollah fired 40 rockets at the Upper Galilee and Haifa, the largest city in northern Israel. A majority were intercepted but “a number” of them fell, IDF said.
     
            Six people were injured in the rocket attack on Krayot near Haifa, MDA said. It was not immediately clear if the injuries were caused by Hezbollah rockets or falling interceptors.
     
            Hezbollah has ramped up rocket attacks on Haifa. On Tuesday the Iran-backed group fired more than 100 rockets on Haifa and the Galilee in one hour, the Israeli military said.
     
This post has been updated with additional information. 
 
            Iran would respond with force to any Israeli attack, Ebrahim Rezaei, a member of Iran’s parliament and spokesperson for its National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, told CNN, adding that his country may choose to target sites beyond Israeli military positions.
     
            “We have so many missiles,” the spokesperson warned. “In our most recent attack on Israel, we targeted only military sites,” Rezaei told CNN. “There are other targets that we could hit, and we have the capability to do so.”
     
        “Our response will be forceful and hard,” he added, noting that attacks on Iranian interests in other countries, like the April strike on Iran’s diplomatic building in Damascus, will be treated as attacks on Iranian soil.
     
 
            Rezaei said that the United States should halt its military support for Israel and push it toward a ceasefire in Gaza. “Stop the arms and the backing of the Zionist regime (Israel),” he said.
     
            Iran is bracing for an Israeli attack in response to a barrage of missiles fired at it by the Islamic Republic on October 1.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran “will pay” for its attack, with the US pledging support for the Jewish state’s response.
     
            US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to discuss Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack during a Wednesday phone call, according to a person familiar with the plans.
     
            The conversation will be the first known call between the men in 49 days, a striking period of silence for two counterparts who spoke frequently in the weeks after the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
     
            The call is expected to take place on Wednesday morning, according to a source familiar.
     
            Biden told reporters last week he expected to speak to Netanyahu once Israel had decided on a response to Iran, though it wasn’t clear whether the plans had been finalized.
     
            American officials are hoping to limit Israel’s actions to a proportional response, and Biden was expected to address that with Netanyahu on Wednesday. The president has said he opposes strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and recommended against a strike on Iranian oil reserves.
     
            How much weight Biden’s words will carry is an open question, and US officials have grown increasingly wary of Netanyahu’s willingness to listen to Biden’s advice.
     
            The call comes after CNN reported that Netanyahu had instructed his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant not to depart Tuesday for the US, where he was scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, saying he wanted to speak with Biden first.
     
            Iran has significantly increased engagement with Arab states in the past few weeks, with officials shuttling between neighboring countries for consultations as Israel plans a possible strike on the Islamic Republic.
     
            Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he’s traveling to Saudi Arabia and “other countries” on Wednesday days after holding meetings in Beirut and Damascus. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, traveled to Qatar a day after Tehran struck Israel with a large salvo of missiles last week.
     
            The trip to Riyadh would mark the third Iranian-Saudi meeting in less than a month. The two countries’ foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly late last month, then Pezeshkian met the Saudi foreign minister in Qatar earlier this month.
     
        “Iran is determined to keep consolidating its relations with its neighbors in pursuit of sustainable security and stability as well as economic cooperation that would benefit all nations of the region,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on X.
     
 
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the strike on Israel in response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iranian commander Abbas Nilforoushan and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has not yet announced how it will respond but has vowed to strike back.
     
            Araghchi is traveling to Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, to “consult on regional developments” and to “try to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon and Gaza,” he told local media.
     
Remember: Last year, Iran and Saudi Arabia restored ties after decades of animosity. The two countries reopened embassies in 2023 under an agreement mediated by China.
     
            On the sidelines of an Asia conference in Qatar last week, Pezeshkian and Araghchi met with some of their Arab counterparts. “Our neighbors are our priority—#StrongRegion our goal—#Dialogue is a must,” Araghchi wrote on X at the time.
     
            Israel’s energy minister explicitly said that Israeli soldiers have “occupied” the southern Lebanese village of Maroun Al-Ras, sharing an image of the Israeli flag raised in the village.
     
        “The heroic IDF (Israel Defense Forces) fighters occupied Maroun al-Ras today, and destroyed the houses from which Hezbollah launched anti-tank missiles at the citizens of Israel. We will reach every place from where they try to hurt us, and to every person who tries to hurt us,” Eli Cohen posted on X.
     
 
            On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it took “operational control of a Hezbollah combat compound” in the village.” An earlier video on social media and geolocated by CNN showed Israeli troops hoisting Israel’s flag on the ruins of Iran Garden Park on the southern outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras.
     
            The Israeli military has insisted that its ground incursions in the south are “limited.” But it is unclear if troops advanced deeper into Lebanese territory or withdrew toward Israel.
     
            Satellite imagery shared by Planet Labs from October 5 appears to show Israeli military vehicles behind berms that surround a base belonging to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said “Israeli tanks and other armed elements” had since left the surrounding area.
     
            On Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters the social media footage showing Israeli soldiers in Maroun Al-Ras was “obviously inappropriate,” adding: “We would look to them to comply with what they have said, which these are limited incursions not with the goal of holding territory.”
     
            Palestinian health care workers ordered by Israel to evacuate hospitals say there is “no safe way” to leave and “nowhere to go” as the military once again ramps up its operation in northern Gaza.
     
            Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza said the facility was informed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Tuesday that medical staff and patients must evacuate the hospital “within 24 hours.”
     
            In a voice message sent to reporters, Abu Saifiya said the Israeli military called him “directly” and “in threatening language” told him that patients and staff must evacuate or “we would subject our lives to danger.”
     
            The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of three hospitals in northern Gaza – Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital – according to Doctors Without Borders and the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
     
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
     
            Dr. Abu Saifiya told CNN on Wednesday that Israeli tanks are getting closer to the hospital and that “sounds of explosions can be heard everywhere.” He said his hospital has more than 54 patients, including children, in need of treatment and must be transferred to other hospitals. Some 220 medical workers also remain at the hospital.
     
            Mohammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza – which was also ordered to evacuate – said the facility will not evacuate as long as there are patients in need of medical care. Some are undergoing surgery, he said, including women giving birth via cesarean section.
     
            “Where will these people go?” he told CNN. “If the evacuation happens, there will be no one left to provide healthcare services.”
     
            Israel’s yearlong offensive in Gaza, launched in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, has forced about 1.9 million Palestinians from their homes, decimated the strip’s health care system, damaged cultural sites, eviscerated academic institutions, and spawned a humanitarian crisis of hunger, displacement and disease.
     
            Palestinians say they are barely surviving, let alone able to rebuild, under Israel’s bombardment and siege. Many of Israel’s strikes have hit civilian infrastructure. Israel has for years said Hamas fighters use mosques, hospitals and other civilian buildings to hide from Israeli attacks and launch their own. Hamas has repeatedly denied the claims.
     
            CNN has spoken to people in Gaza’s five governorates – Northern Gaza, Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah – whose lives and livelihoods have been turned to rubble, including doctors, shop owners, aid workers and educators.
     
            As the Israeli military intensifies its war on multiple fronts in the region, people in Gaza fear the world’s focus has shifted from their plight.
     
            “Gaza is not just a warzone. It is home to millions of people trying to live their lives, despite unimaginable circumstances,” Samer Abuzerr, a public health scientist and father-of-four displaced in central Gaza.
     
        “We are more than victims of violence. We are doctors, teachers, students, parents – and we deserve the same dignity and humanity as anyone else. This war has not only shattered buildings, but also the very fabric of our society.”

            Hezbollah fighters have clashed with the Israeli military near the border town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon, according to state media.
     
            Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported Wednesday “an exchange of gunfire between the enemy and the resistance (Hezbollah) in Al-Labbouneh area near the town of Naqoura,” citing its correspondent in the southern city of Tyre.
     
            Hezbollah earlier said its forces had successfully repelled an Israeli advance in the area at about 5 a.m. local time.
     
            “The Islamic Resistance Mujahideen targeted it with artillery shells and rockets and achieved direct hits, which led to its retreat,” the group said.
     
            The Israeli military told CNN there are “counter-terrorism activities” ongoing in Lebanon but has not commented on the specific incident.
     
            On Tuesday, Israel’s military said it had expanded operations into southwestern Lebanon.
     
            The ground incursion in southern Lebanon, which began Oct 1, had previously been focused on the eastern part of the border area.
     
            The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of three hospitals in northern Gaza – Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital – according to both Doctors Without Borders and the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
     
            Kamal Adwan Hospital was given 24 hours to evacuate, according to its director Hussam Abu Safiya, who said staff had already transferred some patients to other hospitals and would try to evacuate more, due to a lack of fuel. He said the hospital will continue to provide medical services, as so many people were still in need.
     
            The hospital is the only fully functioning medical facility in northern Gaza, according to Abu Safiya.
     
            Al-Awda Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital are only functioning in a limited capacity, according to hospital officials there.
     
            A leading medical aid group says Israeli evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza are turning it into an “unliveable wasteland” and “effectively emptying out the whole” area of Palestinians.
     
            Since Sunday, the Israeli military has issued evacuation orders for three large areas in northern Gaza — including Beit Hanoun, Jabalya, and Beit Lahia — saying it launched a new ground offensive there to combat efforts by Hamas to rebuild its capabilities in the area.
     
        The orders “affect hundreds of thousands of people, particularly in northern Gaza where more than 400,000 people are under pressure to move southward,” according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
     
 
            Calling the decrees the “latest forced mass displacement” in the area, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said people in parts of northern Gaza are being “urged to move to the overcrowded, so-called humanitarian zone between Al-Mawasi and Deir Al-Balah, where one million people are already living in inhumane conditions.”
     
            The “zone also remains unsafe for civilians and aid workers, as Israeli forces continue to repeatedly strike the area,” the organization said.
     
        “These forced mass evacuations of homes and bombing of neighbourhoods by the Israeli forces are turning the north of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland, effectively emptying out the whole north of the Strip of Palestinian life.”
     
 
            Just last month, an Israeli strike on Al-Mawasi killed at least 19 people and wounded dozens. The Israeli military confirmed the strike and said the operation targeted Hamas fighters there.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Lebanese people they face falling “into the abyss of a long war” as his country escalates its offensive against Hezbollah.
     
            “Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites alike – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war in Israel,” Netanyahu said in a video address to the Lebanese people on Tuesday.
     
        “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will bring destruction and suffering similar to what we see in Gaza.”
     
 
            Lebanon is already seeing “the same patterns” and “methods of warfare” as Israel has used in Gaza, officials from the United Nations said, warning of mass displacement from the ferocity of Israel’s attacks.
     
            Israel’s military offensive has flattened most of Gaza to rubble, with at least 41,900 dead and up to 1.9 million people – about 90% of the enclave’s population – internally displaced.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh was being targeted by a series of strikes overnight.
     
            The strikes had caused massive destruction, including the collapse of four adjacent residential buildings in the Burj Al-Barajneh area, Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported Tuesday.
     
            Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had told people to evacuate areas around specific buildings in the Haret Hreik and Hadath areas of Dahiyeh, saying it would soon target those sites.
     
            On Monday, 36 people were killed and 150 wounded in strikes on parts of southern Lebanon, the health ministry said.
     
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is “postponing his trip” to Washington, DC, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday.
     
            This comes after Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed Gallant not to depart tonight for the United States, where he was scheduled to meet with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, an Israeli official has told CNN.
     
            There were two reasons for Netanyahu’s instructions to Gallant, an Israeli official said. Firstly, Netanyahu wants a phone call with US President Joe Biden before Gallant’s trip, the official said. Also, the prime minister wants the cabinet to vote on the nature of Israel’s response to Iran’s attack before Gallant’s trip, according to the official.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli defense ministry for comment.
     
Some context: CNN earlier reported that senior US officials have acknowledged that the US has limited leverage over what Israel decides to do against Iran following Tehran’s missile attack last week.
     
            “The only leverage that the Americans have right now is summoning the defense minister to Washington and buying time,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN. With Gallant in Washington, Pinkas says, the US likely believes Israel will wait to attack.
     
            Israel has “eliminated” the successor to the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. But the Israeli military said it is still checking whether a strike on Hezbollah intelligence headquarters in Beirut killed Hashem Safieddine.
     
What Netanyahu said: “We have eliminated thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, Nasrallah’s successor, and the successor of Nasrallah’s successor,” he said in a video statement.What the Israeli military said: Safieddine was present in the building during the strike in the Dahiyeh area of Beirut last Friday but “results of this attack are still being assessed,” chief Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a briefing Tuesday, accusing Hezbollah of “attempting to conceal the details.”
     
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also appeared less certain, telling troops at a command post that Safieddine had “probably” been eliminated.
     
Remember: On Saturday, a Lebanese security source told CNN that Hezbollah had lost contact with Safieddine after the Israeli strike. Safieddine was believed to be a possible successor to the Hezbollah leader.
     
            Netanyahu addressed the people of Lebanon directly in the statement Tuesday, urging them to stand up to Hezbollah and “take back your country.”
     
            “Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites alike – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will bring destruction and suffering similar to what we see in Gaza,” he continued.
     
            Israel’s war on Hezbollah has killed more than 1,400 people in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have said.
     
            The Israeli military has ordered the only operating hospital in northern Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours, its director Hussam Abu Safiya said Tuesday.
     
            “The army spoke to me directly in threatening language that tomorrow all the patients will be forced out of Kamal Adwan Hospital … or else we would subject our lives to danger,” Safiya said.
     
            Kamal Adwan Hospital is between Beit Lahiya and Jabalya, two northern Gaza areas that Israel has told residents to evacuate ahead of air and ground operations.
     
        “What is happening is arbitrary and clear displacement of the residents from northern Gaza,” Safiya told CNN.
     
 
            The staff at Kamal Adwan had already transferred some patients to other hospitals and would try to evacuate more due to a lack of fuel, Safiya said.
     
            However, he said the hospital would continue to provide medical services, as so many people were still in need.
     
            “Kamal Adwan Hospital is still the only hospital operating in the north, so putting the hospital out of service would be a big disaster for the people who need (it),” he said.
     
        “There are still many patients in the hospital and there are many babies and children in the neonatal unit, so it is difficult to evacuate,” he said, adding that patients were still arriving.
     
 
            The Gaza health ministry criticized Israel for the evacuation order and called for all medical institutions to be protected.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            Officials from the United Nations say they fear Lebanon could suffer the same fate as Gaza.
     
            “We are seeing the same patterns that we saw in Gaza, the same means and methods of warfare that are being used,” Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the UN’s human rights commissioner, told a press briefing in Geneva Tuesday.
     
        “As a result, we’re seeing civilians pay the ultimate price, whether it be the hospitals being closed, a million people displaced, civilians killed, schools impacted. The devastation is beyond belief for all people in Lebanon as it is in Gaza. We can’t let this happen again,” Laurence continued.
     
 
            James Elder, spokesperson for the United Nations’ Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said the commonalities between Lebanon and Gaza were “everywhere.”
     
        “If we look at the ferocity of the early attacks, if we look at the language being used … Look at the mass displacement. Look at the sheer number of people being forced to move,” Elder said. “The commonalities are unfortunately absolutely there to be seen.”
     
 
            Palestinians fleeing sites of Israel’s renewed military operation in northern Gaza are being shot at as they evacuate, according to residents there and footage shared with CNN documenting their journey.
     
            Mohammad Sultan, 28, said he and his family fled their house in Jabalya in northern Gaza “due to the intense and continuous bombardments in the area.” When he went back to retrieve food, water and blankets, he and other civilians were fired at, he said.
     
        “Drones were firing at everyone passing by on the road,” Sultan told CNN. “Three people were shot right in front of me. My brother and I tried to help the injured get to the hospitals, but a little girl was shot in the neck, and her father was also injured.”
     
 
            The shooting took place at Abu Sharkh roundabout in Jabalya, according to Sultan. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            Footage taken by Sultan during his journey shows residents walking along a sandy road, surrounded by rubble and half-destroyed buildings. Some, including children, are on foot, struggling to walk with heavy bags. Others are on bicycles or tuk-tuks.
     
            Drones can be heard buzzing in the background as the bullwhip-like sound of bullets piercing the air trigger screams and attempts to shelter.

            Lebanon is already seeing “the same patterns” and “methods of warfare” as Israel has used in Gaza, officials from the United Nations said, warning of mass displacement from the ferocity of Israel’s attacks.
     
            Israel’s military offensive has flattened most of Gaza to rubble, with at least 41,900 dead and up to 1.9 million people – about 90% of the enclave’s population – internally displaced.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            Hezbollah militants said they wounded Israeli soldiers after detonating an explosive device and clashing with them as they attempted to enter the Lebanese town of Blida near the border.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said they can’t confirm the claims.
     
            Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh was being targeted by a series of strikes Tuesday night into Wednesday morning local time.
     
            The strikes had caused massive destruction, including the collapse of four adjacent residential buildings in the Burj Al-Barajneh area, Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported Tuesday.
     
            Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had told people to evacuate areas around specific buildings in the Haret Hreik and Hadath areas of Dahiyeh, saying it would soon target those sites.
     
            On Monday, 36 people were killed and 150 wounded in strikes on parts of southern Lebanon, the health ministry said.
     
            Officials from the United Nations say they fear Lebanon could suffer the same fate as Gaza.
     
        “We are seeing the same patterns that we saw in Gaza, the same means and methods of warfare that are being used,” Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the UN’s human rights commissioner, told a press briefing in Geneva Tuesday.
     
 
            “As a result, we’re seeing civilians pay the ultimate price, whether it be the hospitals being closed, a million people displaced, civilians killed, schools impacted. The devastation is beyond belief for all people in Lebanon as it is in Gaza. We can’t let this happen again,” Laurence continued.
     
            James Elder, spokesperson for the United Nations’ Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said the commonalities between Lebanon and Gaza were “everywhere.”
     
            “If we look at the ferocity of the early attacks, if we look at the language being used … Look at the mass displacement. Look at the sheer number of people being forced to move,” Elder said. “The commonalities are unfortunately absolutely there to be seen.”
     
            Hezbollah fired approximately 180 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
     
            “The IDF will continue to operate against the threat of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in defense of the state of Israel and its residents,” it added.
     
            The Israeli military has ordered the only operating hospital in northern Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours, its director Hussam Abu Safiya said Tuesday.
     
        “The army spoke to me directly in threatening language that tomorrow all the patients will be forced out of Kamal Adwan Hospital … or else we would subject our lives to danger,” Safiya said.
     
 
            Kamal Adwan Hospital is between Beit Lahiya and Jabalya, two northern Gaza areas that Israel has told residents to evacuate ahead of air and ground operations.
     
            “What is happening is arbitrary and clear displacement of the residents from northern Gaza,” Safiya told CNN.
     
            The staff at Kamal Adwan had already transferred some patients to other hospitals and would try to evacuate more due to a lack of fuel, Safiya said.
     
            However, he said the hospital would continue to provide medical services, as so many people were still in need.
     
            “Kamal Adwan Hospital is still the only hospital operating in the north, so putting the hospital out of service would be a big disaster for the people who need (it),” he said.
     
            “There are still many patients in the hospital and there are many babies and children in the neonatal unit, so it is difficult to evacuate,” he said, adding that patients were still arriving.
     
            The Gaza health ministry criticized Israel for the evacuation order and called for all medical institutions to be protected.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            Israel has “eliminated” the successor to the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. However, the Israeli military said it is still checking whether a strike on Hezbollah intelligence headquarters in Beirut killed Hashem Safieddine.
     
What Netanyahu said: “We have eliminated thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, Nasrallah’s successor, and the successor of Nasrallah’s successor,” he said in a video statement.What the Israel Defense Forces said: Safieddine was present in the building during the strike in the Dahiyeh area of Beirut last Friday, however, “results of this attack are still being assessed,” chief IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a briefing Tuesday, accusing Hezbollah of “attempting to conceal the details.”
     
 
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also appeared less certain, telling troops at a command post that Safieddine had “probably” been eliminated.
     
Remember: On Saturday, a Lebanese security source told CNN that Hezbollah had lost contact with Safieddine after the Israeli strike. Safieddine was believed to be a possible successor to the Hezbollah leader.
     
            Netanyahu addressed the people of Lebanon directly in the statement Tuesday, urging them to stand up to Hezbollah and “take back your country.”
     
            “Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites alike – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will bring destruction and suffering similar to what we see in Gaza,” he continued.
     
            Israel’s war on Hezbollah has killed more than 1,400 people in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have said.

            At least seven people were killed and 11 wounded by an Israeli attack on a residential building in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday, according to Syrian state broadcaster SANA.
     
            Three Israeli missiles were fired at a building in the densely populated Mazzeh neighborhood of Syria’s capital around 8:15 p.m. local time, SANA said, citing a military source.
     
            Women and children are among those killed, according to SANA. Rescuers are still trying to pull people from under the rubble, it added.
     
            The building has been badly damaged, images and footage from the scene showed. Private property surrounding the targeted building has also been significantly damaged, SANA said.
     
            Images and footage from the scene showed a fire near a damaged apartment building, with people walking around, looking at the extent of the destruction. Emergency vehicles were at the scene.
     
            CNN has geolocated the building and found it is near many diplomatic facilities in western Damascus. Those include the Iranian embassy (0.4 miles away), which also blamed Israel, condemned the “terrorist attack” and said no Iranian people were killed or injured.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to comment.
     
            An Israeli missile strike targeted the same neighborhood back in January, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency claimed at the time, reportedly killing five Iranian military advisers and a number of Syrian forces.

            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is “postponing his trip” to Washington, DC, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday.
     
            This comes after Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed Gallant not to depart tonight for the United States, where he was scheduled to meet with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, an Israeli official has told CNN.
     
            There were two reasons for Netanyahu’s instructions to Gallant, an Israeli official said. Firstly, Netanyahu wants a phone call with US President Joe Biden before Gallant’s trip, the official said. Also, the prime minister wants the cabinet to vote on the nature of Israel’s response to Iran’s attack before Gallant’s trip, according to the official.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli defense ministry for comment.
     
Some context: CNN earlier reported that senior US officials have acknowledged that the US has limited leverage over what Israel decides to do against Iran following Tehran’s missile attack last week. “The only leverage that the Americans have right now is summoning the defense minister to Washington and buying time,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN. With Gallant in Washington, Pinkas says, the US likely believes Israel will wait to attack.

            Israeli forces have hoisted Israel’s flag on the ruins of Iran Garden park on the southern outskirts of the Lebanese border village of Maroun Al-Ras, a video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows.
     
            Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had taken control of a Hezbollah combat compound in the Maroun Al-Ras area.
     
            It’s unclear if the Israeli military is still present in the area. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
     
            Satellite imagery from October 5 appears to show nearly 30 Israeli military vehicles near the Lebanese border village of Maroun Al-Ras, where Israeli soldiers have been filmed hoisting a flag.
     
            While it is unclear when Israeli forces planted the flag, the satellite imagery shared by Planet Labs appears to show the Israeli military vehicles behind berms that surround a base belonging to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
     
            The base is less than half a mile southeast of Iran Garden park, where the Israeli flag was hoisted.
     
            On Tuesday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that the “Israeli tanks and other armed elements” had since left the area surrounding the UNIFIL base.
     
            “I strongly appeal — strongly appeal — to both parties to fully respect the safety and security of UNIFIL,” Guterres said.
     
            CNN analysis of the same imagery indicates that Iran Garden was heavily damaged on October 5.

            More than 1,000 American citizens, legal permanent residents, and family members have departed from Lebanon on US-government organized flights, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday.
     
            The US government has organized 10 flights from the nation that has faced mounting Israeli military operations, Miller said. Those flights each had the capacity for 300 passengers. None have been at capacity so far.
     
            The US government has also been working with Middle East Airlines to block off more than 900 seats on their flights for Americans looking to leave, Miller said.
     
            Miller indicated that the US would continue to organize the flights as long as there was demand from American citizens and not enough capacity on commercial flights.
     
        “If at some point, we find that there’s not enough demand and that the demand that exists can be filled with commercial, we would take a look at moving back to just operating commercial flights. We don’t assess we’re at that point yet,” Miller said.
     
 
            He said 8,800 people are in contact with the US State Department looking for information about leaving Lebanon, but not all of those people have requested assistance to depart.
     
            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has accused Israel of indiscriminate attacks on women, children and the elderly in its military operations, and criticized the United States and Europe for supporting what he called a “barbaric government.”
     
            Speaking in Tehran on Tuesday, Pezeshkian claimed Israel was refusing to follow the rules of war and accused its allies of double standards, noting that Iran was often criticized over its human rights record.
     
        “Europe and America have placed a barbaric government here, and some people who claim to support human rights defend it. (Israel) doesn’t observe any human limits, it easily bombards women, children, elderly and young people,” Pezeshkian said.
     
 
            “It’s very interesting, they talk about human rights and tell us, ‘why do you execute a murderer?’ But no one asks these unmanly people ‘why do you kill innocent women and children?’” he continued.
     
            Pezeshkian’s remarks came during a ceremony celebrating the return of ancient Persian clay tablets from the United States.
     
            Palestinians fleeing sites of Israel’s renewed military operation in northern Gaza are being shot at as they evacuate, according to residents there and footage shared with CNN documenting their journey.
     
            Mohammad Sultan, 28, said he and his family fled their house in Jabalya in northern Gaza “due to the intense and continuous bombardments in the area.” When he went back to retrieve food, water and blankets, he and other civilians were fired at, he said.
     
        “Drones were firing at everyone passing by on the road,” Sultan told CNN. “Three people were shot right in front of me. My brother and I tried to help the injured get to the hospitals, but a little girl was shot in the neck, and her father was also injured.”
     
 
            The shooting took place at Abu Sharkh roundabout in Jabalya, according to Sultan. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            Footage taken by Sultan during his journey shows residents walking along a sandy road, surrounded by rubble and half-destroyed buildings. Some, including children, are on foot, struggling to walk with heavy bags. Others are on bicycles or tuk-tuks.
     
            Drones can be heard buzzing in the background as the bullwhip-like sound of bullets piercing the air trigger screams and attempts to shelter.

            Israel’s Home Front Command has ordered schools in some suburbs of the northern city of Haifa to close after the area was targeted by a rocket barrage from Hezbollah.
     
        “The activity scale will be changed from Partial Activity to Limited Activity, meaning educational activities are prohibited,” the Israeli military said.
     
 
            The restrictions will affect several communities of Haifa Bay, including Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin, where at least two buildings were directly hit by rockets on Tuesday, according to the military.
     
            Global oil prices have spiked in recent days as the conflict in the Middle East has reached fever pitch. They could rise yet further if Israel’s widening war embroils the vital Strait of Hormuz off Iran’s southern coast.
     
            The slim waterway — just 21 miles (34 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point — is “the world’s most important oil transit chokepoint,” according to the US Energy Information Administration.
     
            About one-fifth of the world’s global oil trade passes through the strait every day, notes Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. It also accounts for about a quarter of the world’s daily trade in liquefied natural gas.
     
            As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, so does the risk of disruption to the flow of oil through the strait — or even a complete stoppage.
     
            Last week, Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel’s killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group based in Lebanon, as well as others. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told CNN Sunday that the country was preparing to strike back at Iran and that “everything is on the table.”
     
            Tagliapietra described the febrile situation as “very serious,” adding that any rise in tensions involving the Strait of Hormuz might have consequences resembling the oil shock of the 1970s, when the price of oil went “through the roof.”

            Vice President Kamala Harris identified Iran as the United States’ greatest adversary, in a portion of her “60 Minutes” interview that did not air on the full broadcast Monday.
     
            Asked by interviewer Bill Whitaker to name the top US foe, Harris said: “I think there’s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran.”
     
        “Iran has American blood on their hands,” she went on. “This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.”
     
 
            She would not specify whether she would order preemptive action to take out an Iranian nuclear site if presented proof Tehran was building a nuclear weapon.
     
            “I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,” she said.
     
            Israeli bombs swirled over Jabalya overnight, and houses trembled from explosions, according to a father staying in the besieged refugee camp in northern Gaza.
     
        “There is no difference between night and day due to the intensity of the explosions and the terror,” Mohammad Ibrahim told CNN on Tuesday. “We have come to accept death everywhere.”
     
 
            Entire streets have been deserted, and bodies are scattered on the ground, the father-of-two recalled, after the Israeli military said it launched aerial and ground assaults on the neighborhood targeting renewed Hamas presence. Hamas militants reported heavy fighting in the area.
     
            Ibrahim, 36, told CNN he had been terrorized by the “deafening” sound of aircraft – describing a key roundabout in the area as a “death trap.”
     
            “I woke up in my room to the sound of gunfire, fearing for my safety,” he said. “The sound of the explosion shook my body… As if my blood wanted to escape from the pressure.
     
            “Even the beginning of the war was not characterized by such franticness and killing.”
     
            Several Jabalya residents previously told CNN they could not be uprooted from their homes in Jabalya again, after Israeli forces issued fresh evacuation orders telling people to move south.
     
            “There is no one in the streets; the city is a ghost town,” the history teacher said. “We do not know where the soldiers are or where the ground invasion points are… We cannot leave the house.”
     
            “The loss of communications and networks also makes it difficult,” he said. “No one knows who survived and who was martyred.”
     
            Around 105 rockets were fired at the northern Israeli city of Haifa and the Galilee area in one hour, the Israeli military said Tuesday.
     
            The rockets were fired from Lebanon in two separate barrages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
     
            While numerous rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military, at least two buildings in Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin were directly hit. Israeli emergency services said that a 71-year-old woman was taken to hospital with a shrapnel injury to her hand while others were treated for injuries sustained while making their way to safety.
     
            Prior to the barrages on Haifa, 25 rockets were fired from Lebanon at the Lower Galilee region, according to the IDF.
     
            Hezbollah announced on Tuesday it had “launched a large rocket barrage at the cities of Haifa and Kiryat.”
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian for the first time on Friday to discuss the situation in the Middle East, according to Russian state media TASS.
     
            The announcement of their meeting comes as the region is bracing for Israel’s response to Iran’s largest-ever missile attack last week.
     
            Putin’s meeting with Pezeshkian, a reformist who won Iran’s election in July following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, will take place in the Central Asian country of Turkmenistan, on the sidelines of a forum of regional leaders.
     
        “This meeting is of great importance both for discussing bilateral issues and, of course, for discussing the sharply aggravated situation in the Middle East,” the Russian leader’s aide Yuri Ushakov said Monday, TASS reported. 
     
 
            Putin may also hold other bilateral meetings on his trip to the capital Ashgabat.
     
            Mohammad Mayyat recalled the moment Israeli rockets blasted through Al Bureij – catapulting body parts into the air and killing his only son.
     
            “The rockets fell, and I saw people torn apart. I didn’t know what to do. My only son, after 20 years, is so precious to me,” he told CNN. “We were sitting in front of the house when suddenly we all flew away… We couldn’t run or do anything.”
     
            An Israeli strike on a home in central Gaza killed at least 30 Palestinians on Monday, according to officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. CNN footage early Tuesday shows the lifeless bodies of boys, girls and men filling every inch of the morgue floor. The sun glazed over tens of mourners in the courtyard. In one scene, a woman can be seen holding the face of a man in shrouds – her eyes sore with grief.
     
            Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed least 16,927 children, Gaza’s Government Media Office reported on October 6. CNN cannot independently verify the figures.
     
            One mother, Rihab, told CNN she had waited 14 years to conceive her teenage son, who was killed on Monday. “My son was in my arms when a shrapnel hit his heart. He died immediately.”
     
            Another survivor recalled watching the news with her family, when suddenly a rocket hurtled toward the house. “It broke us all into pieces,” said Ruwaida Abdul Hadi. “My daughter and her husband, my sons, my grandchildren, my husband — they are all gone, and I’m left alone.”
     
            The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it was “dismantling terrorist infrastructure sites and eliminating terrorists” in Al Bureij. CNN cannot independently verify the statement.
     
            Hezbollah supports efforts by Lebanon’s parliament speaker at achieving a ceasefire with Israel, the group’s Deputy Secretary General said Tuesday, the first time the group has publicly endorsed the negotiations since the war started.
     
        “We support the political efforts led by (Parliament Speaker Nabih) Berri under the banner of achieving a ceasefire. Once the ceasefire is firmly established and diplomacy can reach it, all other details will be discussed and decisions will be made collaboratively,” Naim Qassem said.
     
 
            Berri is the leader of the predominantly Shiite Amal party allied to Hezbollah, and has been a key figure in negotiations for a ceasefire.
     
            Hezbollah previously said it would only stop firing at Israel once a ceasefire is reached with Hamas in Gaza. Israel, however, insisted that Hezbollah separate its conflict with Israel from the ongoing war with Hamas.
     
            Much of Qassem’s speech on the anniversary of Hezbollah’s escalated conflict with Israel carried a defiant tone, emphasizing Hezbollah’s readiness and capability to continue its fight against Israel.
     
        “If the enemy continues its war, then the battlefield will be decisive, and the battlefield belongs to us” he said.
     
 
            Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN last week that slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a temporary ceasefire before he was assassinated by Israel. Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, called Bou Habib’s claim “ridiculous” in an interview with Sky News on Sunday.
     
            Hezbollah’s top official said Hamas’ attacks on Israel a year ago sparked “the beginning of a transformation” in the Middle East, as Israel expands its war on multiple fronts in an increasingly frayed region.
     
        “I can say that (October 7) marks the beginning of a transformation in the Middle East, signifying the presence and impact of the resistance,” Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary general of the Iran-backed group, said on Tuesday.
     
 
            “To all those who doubt Iran’s contributions and support: Iran decides how and when to provide its support. It has been giving it for many years,” he added. “The enemy’s military losses in northern (of Israel) are significant, but they are not being announced.”
     
Anniversary of war: Qassem delivered his speech on October 8 — one year since the Lebanese militant group started trading strikes with Israel.
     
            Those tensions exploded in mid-September, when Israel detonated a series of attacks targeting Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. Many of those killed were civilian bystanders, including children. Later that month, Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Israel has since unleashed a sustained aerial campaign in south and east Lebanon – and a ground incursion. Hezbollah has launched rocket barrages on Israel response. More than 1,400 people in Lebanon have been killed, according to authorities there.
     
            Hezbollah said it started firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, and Palestinians trying to survive Israeli attacks in Gaza, which have killed 41,909 people, according to the Ministry of Health there.
     
            About 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah’s rocket attacks.
     
CNN’s Sana Noor Haq contributed reporting.
 
            Israel’s military said it has expanded its “limited, localized, targeted operations” into southwestern Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s 146th Division targeted operational activities against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure in southwestern Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Tuesday.
     
        “The 146th Division is the first reserve division to operate in southern Lebanon as part of the ongoing operations against Hezbollah in the northern arena,” the IDF said, adding that the division “has served as a defensive regional brigade and its forces were deployed in northern Israel, the Gaza Strip” and the occupied West Bank.
     
 
            The division will be working alongside the 213th Artillery Brigade.
     
            The Israeli military’s ground incursion in southern Lebanon, which began a week ago, had been focused on the eastern part of the border area.
     
            The Israeli military has claimed that it killed the commander of Hezbollah’s headquarters, Suhail Hussein Husseini, in “the area of Beirut.”
     
            CNN is unable to independently verify the claim, how senior in Hezbollah Husseini is, and what role he played. Hezbollah has yet to confirm whether Husseini has been killed.
     
        The Israeli military said the “headquarters oversees logistics” for Hezbollah and is “in charge of budgeting and management of its various units in the organization.”
     
 
            Husseini, according to the Israeli military, played a role in “weapon transfers between Iran and Hezbollah and was responsible for distributing the advanced weaponry among Hezbollah’s units,” and he also was a “member of the Jihad council, Hezbollah’s senior military leadership council.”
     
            The death toll from an Israeli strike on a house at Al Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on Monday has risen to 30, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said on Tuesday.
     
            The Israeli military has intensified aerial bombardment on central Gaza in recent days – saying on Tuesday that it was “dismantling terrorist infrastructure sites and eliminating terrorists” in the neighborhood. CNN cannot independent verify the statement.

            As the Israeli military battles Iran-backed militant groups on multiple fronts, the Middle East faces its greatest upheaval in a half-century.
     
            Israel will “continue to fight,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks. Israel has said its goal in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and bring back the remaining hostages, but neither has been achieved a year into the war.
     
            Israel intercepted dozens of strikes from multiple directions on the anniversary, including projectiles launched from northern Gaza and Lebanon, and a surface-to-surface missile fired from Yemen.
 
            Israel has launched a new offensive in northern Gaza, where it has failed to defeat Hamas, and it continues to mull an anticipated retaliation against Iran for last week’s barrage of missiles.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
This post has been updated with additional information.
 
            On the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks, Gaza’s north was hit with more Israeli strikes, with no end in sight to the war devastating the enclave. Israel’s objective of defeating Hamas still seems far from reach as its military offensives in Gaza continue to ramp up.
     
            Israel launched a new ground operation in northern Gaza on Sunday and encircled the Jabalya refugee camp, where it says it saw signs of Hamas regrouping. Hamas’s military wing said its fighters clashed with “enemy forces” in Jabalya, an indication the group has been able to maintain a presence there. Earlier this year, Israel’s military said it had defeated Hamas in northern Gaza, only to announce new offensives there in May.
     
            An Israeli airstrike killed at least 10 people in the Jabalya camp on Monday. The camp was targeted early on in Israel’s response to Hamas’ attacks one year ago and has been struck several times during the war.
     
            The Israeli military also issued fresh evacuation orders to residents in northern and southern Gaza on Monday, as it ramped up its attacks in both parts of the pummeled enclave.
     
            The war has displaced 1.9 million people, according to the United Nations. Residents who spoke to CNN said they feel there is no safe place to go.
     
            A worker for the non-profit organization Mercy Corps that CNN spoke to said she has been displaced more than a dozen times since last year. She now lives in a shelter in central Gaza. CNN is not using her real name due to concerns for her safety.
     
        “We haven’t put our clothes in wardrobes, bathed comfortably, had a meal with any sense of peace, slept on a proper bed, or had clean drinking water in over a year,” Lena said.
     
 
            The war has killed more than 41,000 people, more than a third of whom are children. Almost 100,000 are wounded, and an unknown number of people — possibly in the thousands — remain under rubble across Gaza, according to the UN.
     
            Hundreds of aid workers have been killed, including more than 220 team members of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which chief Philippe Lazzarini said was the highest death toll in the history of the United Nations.
     
        “One year has passed and not a day goes by without families in Gaza being subjected to unspeakable suffering, as forced displacement, disease, hunger, and death have become the daily norm for 2 million people trapped in a bombed-out and besieged enclave,” Lazzarini said.
     
 
            Two weeks after Israel upended a US-led ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, the US is not actively trying to revive the deal and has resigned itself to trying to shape and limit Israeli operations in Lebanon and against Iran rather than halting hostilities, US officials told CNN.
     
            The US’ inability to halt Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground invasion of Lebanon, which has killed over 1,400 people in less than three weeks and displaced over 1 million more, has raised questions about whether Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is disregarding the Biden administration’s calls for more restraint like it did in Gaza, leaving the White House again looking feckless.
     
            Concerns within the Biden administration are running high, officials say, that what Israel has promised would be a limited operation will soon grow into a larger-scale and prolonged conflict. US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have also floundered.
     
            As with Gaza, US officials say Israel was initially planning for a much larger ground incursion into Lebanon before the US convinced it to scale back. But they also acknowledge what they have learned over the last year, which is that the US’ influence is limited when it comes to Israel’s military operations.

            An explosion tore through the skies of Beirut on Monday evening (local time). Nightly strikes have targeted the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital city since September 27.
     
            A CNN camera captured the explosion, which flashed in the skies for less than a second but cast an orange light from the area that was targeted.
     
            CNN staff also heard several strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs during the day.
     
            About half an hour before the explosion was captured by CNN, Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), warned residents that the IDF was going to target two areas in the southern suburbs, Burj Al-Barajneh and Hadath, which he said were located near Hezbollah facilities and interests.
     
Hospitals in the unsafe zones: At least seven hospitals are in the no-go zones imposed by the Israeli military in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, including Al Rassoul Al Azam Hospital and St. Therese Hospital, CNN analysis of Israeli military evacuation orders found.
     
            In a later statement, the IDF said the Israeli Air Force had conducted strikes on “terror targets belonging to Hezbollah’s Intelligence Headquarters” on Monday night.
     
            The IDF said it had also struck alleged Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa area on Monday morning, including “weapons storage facilities, terror infrastructure sites, and a launcher.”
     
            At least seven hospitals are in the no-go zones imposed by the Israeli military in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, including Al Rassoul Al Azam Hospital and St. Therese Hospital, CNN analysis of Israeli military evacuation orders found.
     
            The unsafe zones in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a group of residential neighborhoods that also house Hezbollah’s seat of power, encompass nearly 9 square kilometers (3.4 square miles).
     
            CNN analyzed a total of 39 evacuation orders up to and including the night of October 6, which have been issued almost daily since September 27 by Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee in posts on X.
     
            Typically, the posts warn residents to “immediately” evacuate specific buildings slated for targeting and flee to areas beyond a 500-meter radius of the target. Satellite images embedded in the posts show the target buildings highlighted in red.
     
            Over the past 10 days, such warnings have preceded airstrikes, sometimes by no more than a few minutes. In other cases, notably two strikes that hit within Beirut’s city limits for the first time since the 2006 war, no such warnings were issued. CNN asked the Israeli military for comment on this at the time and did not receive a response.
     
            CNN verified the locations of 39 buildings identified as being near Hezbollah targets by the Israeli military up to the night of October 6, and measured a 500-meter radius around each one to calculate the total area from which civilians were ordered to evacuate. It adds up to 8.9 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) of the city’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh.
     
            The east of Dahiyeh has been the epicenter of announced airstrikes so far, with some hitting very close to Lebanon’s only public airport.
     
            The Israeli military has not yet given residents guidance on when they can return to the affected areas.
     
            CNN also found that infographics shared early on by the Israeli military alongside its evacuation orders were inaccurate in some cases. The graphics appear to illustrate the 500-meter zone around target buildings from which residents must evacuate for their safety – showing a red circle around the highlighted building, and a dotted line annotated with “500 meters” in Arabic. In actuality, the radiuses of the highlighted buffer zones in those cases only measured around 100 meters. This was the case for six separate evacuation orders before the IDF stopped including illustrations of the no-go-zones in their graphics. CNN has contacted the IDF for comment.
     
            Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said Monday that the risk of an unintended escalation in the Middle East looms as “a very real danger,” even though the US maintains its assessment that neither Iran nor Israel “is looking for an all-out conflict.”
     
            Israel is “weighing very carefully how it’s going to respond to the most recent Iranian ballistic missile attack,” Burns said at a national security conference in Sea Island, Georgia, declining to speculate on what form that retaliation might take.
     
            “I think all of us are acutely aware of the consequences of different forms of strikes and consequences for the global energy market and the global economy,” he said.
     
            US President Joe Biden said last week that he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities, but it is not clear whether the US has successfully persuaded Israel to take that option off the table; markets have also been on edge due to the possibility that Israel could choose to strike oil facilities in Iran.
     
            The greatest risk of escalation, Burns said, comes from “misjudgments,” what he termed “the ‘stuff happens’ category.”
     
        “You can see the potential for inadvertent collisions, misunderstandings, actions that take on the life of their own,” he said.
     
 
            On Iran, he said, the supreme leader continues to be the “ultimate decision-maker,”and said his agency has not detected “any kind of dramatic change of tone there.”
     
            Burns also said he continues to hold out some hope that a successful deal can be reached between Israel and Hamas that could result in the release of the remaining living hostages. But those negotiations, he said, have “been pushing a very big rock up a very steep hill.”
     
            “We’ve come close at least a couple of times, but it’s been very elusive,” he said.

Our live coverage has moved here.
 
            On the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks, Gaza’s north was hit with more Israeli strikes — with no end in sight to the war devastating the enclave.
     
            An Israeli airstrike killed at least 10 people in the Jabalya refugee camp, hospital officials said. Jabalya was targeted early on in Israel’s response to Hamas’ attacks one year ago and the camp has been struck several times during the war. Israel launched a new ground operation in the area on Sunday and encircled the camp, where it says it saw signs of Hamas regrouping.
     
            The Israeli military also issued fresh evacuation orders to residents in northern and southern Gaza on Monday, as it ramped up its offensive in both parts of the pummeled enclave.
     
            The war has displaced 1.9 million people, according to the United Nations. Residents who spoke to CNN said they feel there is no safe place to go.
     
            The war has killed more than 41,000 people, more than a third of whom are children. Almost 100,000 are wounded, and an unknown number of people — possibly in the thousands — remain under rubble across Gaza, according to the UN.
     
            Hundreds of aid workers have been killed, including more than 220 team members of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which agency chief Philippe Lazzarini said was the highest death toll in the history of the United Nations.
     
        “One year has passed and not a day goes by without families in Gaza being subjected to unspeakable suffering, as forced displacement, disease, hunger, and death have become the daily norm for 2 million people trapped in a bombed-out and besieged enclave.”
     
        Lazzarini wrote in a statement.
     
            Hezbollah fired about 190 projectiles toward Israel from Lebanon on Monday, as of 11 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET), according to the Israeli military.
     
            In various statements, Hezbollah said it was targeting gatherings of soldiers and Israeli military locations.
     
            Israel will “continue to fight,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday in a speech marking a year since Hamas’ October 7 attacks. Meanwhile in the US, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also marked the “solemn” anniversary and called for a ceasefire and hostage deal.
     
            This comes as questions swirl about whether Netanyahu’s government is disregarding the Biden administration’s calls for more restraint like it did in Gaza, leaving the White House again looking feckless.
     
Here are some developments in the region today: 
 
In Israel: Israel intercepted projectiles from different directions today:
     
In Lebanon: Israeli strikes killed people in multiple incidents in Lebanon. Here’s a rundown:
     
In Gaza: CNN received multiple reports of death across Gaza due to Israeli strikes. Here’s a rundown:
     
In West Bank: Israeli forces killed a 12-year-old boy during an incursion into a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Monday morning, Palestinian officials said.
     
            Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said Monday that the risk of an unintended escalation in the Middle East looms as “a very real danger,” even though the US maintains its assessment that neither Iran nor Israel “is looking for an all-out conflict.”

            “We’ve come close at least a couple of times, but it’s been very elusive,” he said.
     
             “The President has been very clear that all of us will continue to do everything we can, with our eyes wide open — I’ve learned not to get my hopes up on this issue over the course of the last year — but with a real determination, given the fact that when I meet with hostage families, it’s not only heartbreaking but also inspiring, given the depth of their commitment to their loved ones.”
     
            Monday marked the first anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks, and a year since Israel began its war against the militant group in Gaza.
     
            Over the past year, the site of the massacre on October 7 in Israel – a remote location just a few miles from the Gaza perimeter – has been turned into a memorial.
     
            Instead of the vast open space, there are now hundreds of near identical cenotaphs, each featuring the name and a picture of a victim.
     
            The Nova Music Festival massacre was by far the deadliest of the October 7 attacks, accounting for nearly a third of the victims. There were so many dead and kidnapped that it took Israeli authorities months to determine how many people had been killed there.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday that 347 people, most of them young, died at the site and some 40 others were kidnapped.
     
            More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then. The war has sparked a major humanitarian disaster, displacing nearly all of the strip’s 2.2 million residents.
     
            As people gathered across Israel, the reminders that the war in Gaza is still raging kept coming. Throughout the morning, loud booms of outgoing fire reverberated throughout southern Israel as the IDF hit targets in the Gaza strip.
     
            Israel has said its goal in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and bring back the remaining hostages, but neither has been achieved. Indeed, as the anniversary events got under way, several rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel, injuring two people.

            The skies of Beirut were lit up by an explosion on Monday evening (local time) amid nightly strikes that have targeted the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital city since September 27.

            The Israeli military says multiple projectiles have been fired from Lebanon into Israel on Monday evening, local time.
     
        “Following the sirens that sounded in central Israel, several projectile launches were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Details are under review,” according to the Israel Defense Forces.
     
 
            A CNN team in Tel Aviv witnessed several intercepts.
     
            The Israeli military said it identified approximately five projectiles launched from Lebanon into Israel on Monday night. Some were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas, the military said.
     
            Hezbollah says it launched a rocket barrage targeting an Israeli military intelligence base on the outskirts of Tel Aviv Monday night.
     
This post has been updated with additional comment from the Israeli military and Hezbollah. 
 
            At least seven hospitals are in the no-go zones imposed by the Israeli military in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, including Al Rassoul Al Azam Hospital and St. Therese Hospital, CNN analysis of Israeli military evacuation orders found.
     
            The unsafe zones in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a group of residential neighborhoods that also house Hezbollah’s seat of power, encompass nearly 9 square kilometers (3.4 square miles).
     
            CNN analyzed a total of 39 evacuation orders up to and including the night of October 6, which have been issued almost daily since September 27 by Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee in posts on X.
     
            Typically, the posts warn residents to “immediately” evacuate specific buildings slated for targeting and flee to areas beyond a 500-meter radius of the target. Satellite images embedded in the posts show the target buildings highlighted in red.
     
            Over the past 10 days, such warnings have preceded airstrikes, sometimes by no more than a few minutes. In other cases, notably two strikes that hit within Beirut’s city limits for the first time since the 2006 war, no such warnings were issued. CNN asked the Israeli military for comment on this at the time and did not receive a response.
     
            CNN verified the locations of 39 buildings identified as being near Hezbollah targets by the Israeli military up to the night of October 6, and measured a 500-meter radius around each one to calculate the total area from which civilians were ordered to evacuate. It adds up to 8.9 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) of the city’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh.
     
            The east of Dahiyeh has been the epicenter of announced airstrikes so far, with some hitting very close to Lebanon’s only public airport.
     
            The Israeli military has not yet given residents guidance on when they can return to the affected areas.
     
            CNN also found that infographics shared early on by the Israeli military alongside its evacuation orders were inaccurate in some cases. The graphics appear to illustrate the 500-meter zone around target buildings from which residents must evacuate for their safety – showing a red circle around the highlighted building, and a dotted line annotated with “500 meters” in Arabic. In actuality, the radiuses of the highlighted buffer zones in those cases only measured around 100 meters. This was the case for six separate evacuation orders before the IDF stopped including illustrations of the no-go-zones in their graphics. CNN has contacted the IDF for comment.
     
            Israel will “continue to fight,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday in a speech marking a year since Hamas’ October 7 attacks.
     
        “As long as the enemy threatens our existence and the peace of our country, we will continue to fight,” Netanyahu said during a ceremony in the Israeli city of Ofakim. “As long as our hostages are still in Gaza, we will continue to fight.”
     
 
            The prime minister reiterated Israel’s war goals, including toppling Hamas, returning the hostages in Gaza to Israel, returning to their homes Israelis who have fled from the south and north along with “eliminating any future threat from Gaza to Israel.”
     
            “October 7 will symbolize for generations the cost of our revival, and for generations it will demonstrate how determined we are and how strong our spirit is,” Netanyahu said.
     
            “Together we will continue to fight. And together, with God’s help, we will win,” he added.
     
            Israel needs to “turn tactical wins in battle into a strategy that secures Israel’s people and its future,” the White House national security adviser said at an event commemorating one year since the October 7 attacks.
     
            “It takes foresight to match the conduct of war to a clear and sustainable set of objectives, and to turn tactical advantage into enduring, strategic gains,” Jake Sullivan said at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, referring to the war in Gaza. “That is never easy, but it’s imperative, and we are here to work with you on that.”
     
            His forward-looking comments were echoed by State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller earlier Monday. He said at a press briefing that it’s “very difficult to answer” whether Israel is safer in the long-term after one year of the war in Gaza.
     
            “Certainly, Israel is safer when it comes to the immediate threat that Hamas bears to the Israeli people. Hamas can, in no way, today launch an attack with the size, scale and scope of the attack it launched on October 7. So when it comes to dealing with the threat from Hamas, Israel is safer, at least in the short term,” Miller said.
     
            However, “as long as Israel is mired in conflict in Gaza, as long as it is dealing with an unstable situation on its northern border, as long as it is dealing with unrest and insecurity in the West Bank, ultimately, its security is never going to be assured,” he added.
     
            Miller said that there must be a path forward on “governance in Gaza by someone other than Hamas.”
     
            Israel will “reap with joy” what it has “sown in tears,” Israel’s President Isaac Herzog said on Monday — in a speech marking one year since Hamas’ October 7 attacks.
     
            “It has already been a year — a full year of heartbreak and pain,” Herzog said, adding that the hearts of Israelis are bound to the hostages still held in Gaza with “love and worry.”
     
            “We know we will not be whole until they return to us,” he said.
     
            The president said that he bowed his head in “gratitude and reverence” to the families of those murdered and kidnapped by Hamas and wished them “healing and comfort.”
     
            “From here, I promise us, all of us, that we will continue to build, and we will reap with joy what we have sown in tears,” he continued. “Elderly men and women will once again sit in the gardens of homes in the western Negev, and the streets of the Galilee settlements will once again be filled with children playing.”
     
            “We will rise together, only together, and this love, sanctified in blood, will once again bloom among us,” Herzog said.
     
            Israel’s military called on residents in several neighborhoods of the southern suburbs of Beirut to evacuate Monday night local time.
     
            The areas under the latest evacuation order were the suburbs of Burj Al-Barajneh and Hadath, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X. The post was accompanied by a map of the area with specific buildings identified.
     
            “For your safety and the safety of your families, you must evacuate these buildings and the surrounding ones immediately and move at least 500 meters away from them,” Adraee warned Lebanese citizens.
     
            Earlier Monday, an Israeli strike caused a large blast near Beirut’s airport in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital.
     
            Large smoke plumes were seen rising from the southern Dahiyeh neighborhood following the strike, though planes continued to depart and land at Beirut’s international airport.
     
            It’s been 10 months since Al Jazeera English correspondent Youmna ElSayed fled Gaza, and she said it was “one of the most difficult decisions” even as it was the “only choice” she had to save her children.
     
            “My greatest fears were always that my children at home are not safe, and I could lose them in any air strike,” she told CNN.
     
            “I was forced to leave because I was left with no other choice to protect their lives. I was threatened more than once I was displaced over six times. Life was getting incredibly more and more challenging every single day,” she explained.
     
            She now lives in Egypt, where she said life hasn’t been easy as she struggles with survivor’s guilt. “It has impacted me a lot physically and emotionally, mentally,” she said.
     
            ElSayed criticized the underreporting of the devastation in Gaza, and pointed that the public has started seeing the situation because they follow Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents who are “documenting these war crimes that they are subjected to.”
     
            She described meeting a child at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis who was carrying a backpack close to his chest. “He asked me, ‘do you know what’s in my backpack?’ And before I can answer, I see blood under the backpack. Just like that, scenes of blood. And I just know inside what I’m expecting to see. I know what he’s trying to tell me.”
     
            It was his 5-year-old brother, she told CNN. “I didn’t have the courage to document that,” she said.
     
            “I felt for quite some time guilty that I was not brave enough to document it,” she said. “I let him down because I did not react quickly and document that. I blamed myself for days. And this has been 10 months ago, and I can’t get over it, and I will never get over it.”
     
            As she reflected on a year of war in Gaza, she said life in Gaza before October 7 “wasn’t normal anyway.”
     
            “We had no opportunities to travel, to plan a simple vacation like any family in the world, even if we had the financial means. If someone got sick, we weren’t sure if we could be able to take this person to lifesaving treatment somewhere else, or he would die in Gaza,” she said, placing responsibility on western governments and lawmakers — not the people — for “double standards” on the Israel-Gaza issue.
     
            At least 11 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in central and northern Gaza, according to local authorities.
     
            Seven people were killed in an Israeli strike on a house at Al Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said Monday.
     
            And at least four people, including two children, were killed in a strike on a residential building in the Beit Lahia area, according to the head of emergency services in northern Gaza, Fares Afana.
     
            Several injured people were recovered from the site in Beit Lahia but others remained under the rubble, Afana added.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they launched both missiles and drones at Israel on Monday.
     
            The Houthis fired two missiles at Israeli military sites in Jaffa and Tel Aviv, Houthi army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a televised speech.
     
            Both missiles “(achieved) their objectives successfully,” Saree claimed.
     
            Earlier Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had said a surface-to-surface missile fired from Yemen was successfully intercepted by the Israeli Air Force.
     
            Israeli fire crews worked to put out fires caused by fragments of an intercepted projectile in Beit Shemesh near Jerusalem, a spokesperson for the area said.
     
            Saree also said that the Houthis had launched drones into Jaffa, in central Israel, and Eilat in southern Israel. The IDF said it was “not aware” of any drone launches from Yemen.
     
            The Houthis attacked Israel “in continued support of the oppressed Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, and in solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance movements,” Saree said.
     
            The year since the Israel-Hamas war began in Gaza has been the deadliest for media workers since most journalism and press freedom organizations have started tracking journalist deaths in conflict.
     
            According to the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders, at least 128 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war, nearly all of them Palestinian media workers in Gaza killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes. Some of the journalists died while wearing protective gear identifying them as members of the press. Multiple news organizations and free press groups have accused the Israeli military of deliberately targeting journalists.
     
            The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not intentionally target journalists, but that it cannot guarantee the safety of reporters in an “active military zone” and has accused Hamas of deliberately placing military operations “in the vicinity of journalists and civilians.” It has also accused a handful of Palestinian journalists as having participated in the October 7 attack or being members of Hamas, something the media organizations have largely and vehemently denied.
     
            Many media organizations, including CNN, evacuated their full-time staff in the enclave with their families as soon as possible. Gaza was never an easy place to report from, between restrictions on entry and exit and pressure from Hamas against any inkling of dissent.
     
            Reporters in Israel have also noted a marked increase in physical attacks, with the Union of Journalists in Israel noting at least 40 such attacks since October 7, from security forces as well as civilians. Four Israeli journalists were killed in the October 7 attacks, and others barely survived.
     
            When he was younger, 18-year-old Hassan Hamad dreamed of being a doctor when he grew up, according to his brother Mohammad. But the October 7 attacks last year and the ensuing war in Gaza made him want to become a journalist instead.
     
            After months of documenting Israel’s offensive in his home territory, the 18-year-old reporter was killed when his family’s apartment was hit in an Israeli missile attack in Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza on Sunday, according to witness testimony and footage shared with CNN.
     
        “I couldn’t imagine that Hassan had been torn apart and that his body had been reduced to remains. I saw part of his hair with his curls, and I knew he was gone,” said 25-year-old Mohammad Hamad, who was also injured in the strike.
     
 
            In the aftermath of the assault, Mohammad recalled trying to recover Hassan’s scattered body parts. “My father, our neighbor, and I collected four kilograms (nine pounds) of his flesh… My father buried Hassan’s remains in the garden until we could collect the rest,” he said.
     
            “I feel so much guilt because I opened the door (to my apartment) for him. I shouldn’t have opened it,” Mohammad said, adding that they were just two meters (about six and a half feet) from each other when the strike happened.
     
            “Hassan was very brave. He wanted the world to see what was happening in northern Gaza, and he insisted on doing the job even though many of his colleagues were killed,” Mohammad added.
     
            Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed a record number of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which reported on Friday that at least 128 journalists and media workers — mostly Palestinian — have been killed.
     
            The United States continues to assess Israel’s ground operations in Lebanon to be “limited,” but a State Department spokesperson Monday would not say whether the US views the Israeli airstrikes in Beirut to also be “limited.”
     
            Matthew Miller argued that the US supports strikes targeting Hezbollah, but expects them to be done “in a way that complies with international humanitarian law and minimizes civilian casualties.”
     
            Similar calls from the US for Israel to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza have not yielded results.
     
            Miller said Monday that he did not have a “sweeping characterization” of the Israeli military’s strikes on the Lebanese capital and would not say if the US assesses them to be in compliance with international humanitarian law. He also would not say if the US is carrying out its own assessments of the matter.
     
            “I can’t give you a readout of what we’re doing with respect to strikes in Lebanon, but we take that obligation incredibly seriously,” he said at a press briefing.
     
            The US continued to organize flights for American citizens to leave Lebanon over the weekend, bringing the total number of US citizens, legal permanent residents and their family members evacuated to about 900, according to a State Department spokesperson.
     
            “There was another flight that left today from Beirut to Istanbul,” spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a  briefing. “That flight had approximately 150 passengers on it, American citizens, legal permanent residents and their family members.”
     
            Miller indicated that none of the flights organized by the US have been full. He said that the US has chartered a total of eight flights with 300 seats available on each for a total of 2,400 available seats, of which about 900 had been filled.
     
            Miller also said that the US has also continue to reserve seats on commercial flights for US citizens to leave Lebanon, bringing the total to 868 seats reserved.
     
            “We don’t know exactly how many of those have been filled, because we don’t get an exact number, but we know that a significant proportion of those 868 seats have been filled,” said Miller.
     
            Miller said that the number of Americans in Lebanon who have reached out to the State Department for information about possibly leaving the country has also increased to around 8,500, but noted that not all of them have chosen to leave.
     
            “We advise them to leave, and we’ve been making these seats available, and we’ll continue to make them available as long as there is demand, and long as the security situation demands it,” said Miller, who noted that many of the US citizens in Lebanon are “making daily assessments about their situation.”
     
            It’s been a year since Meirav Gonen’s daughter, Romi, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in Israel on October 7, 2023.
     
            It’s been one year since Gonen heard her daughter’s voice, she told CNN, adding that she doesn’t know how her daughter looks like today, if she’s holding up, if she lost her hand after being shot on the day of the attack, or if she’s smiling like she always smiled.
     
            “I cannot even explain how you feel when you wake up in the morning, and for the first moments you hope this is only a nightmare, a dream, a bad dream. But then you are waking up to a reality,” she said. “This is so agonizing, it’s so difficult.”
     
            Gonen said some Israeli hostages who returned home were with her daughter and they told her stories about her in captivity.
     
        “They came back with stories — funny stories, and some disturbing also stories. She’s holding up. She was saying she’s holding up for me. And I want her to see me and I want her to see that I’m strong. I’m strong for her. I’m strong for her brothers and sisters,” she told CNN on Monday.
     
 
            The freed hostages also said that her daughter lost color in her fingers, Gonen said.
     
            “The color in her fingers was changing, that her hand is not functioning,” Gonen said. “That time I thought, wow, she’s she’s going to lose her hand. We have to bring her back. But today I’m saying, it doesn’t matter if she lost her hand. We just have to bring her back alive.”
     
            In August, the Gonen family marked Romi’s 24th birthday.
     
            “At first, we wanted to hide the fact” that it was her birthday, Gonen said. “But at a certain point, we thought that maybe she will see us.”
     
            So they marked the day to bring light and strength for people, she said.
     
            The war, she said, is not about Israel and Palestine, but rather against Hamas. “We will not break because we are the good and the Hamas is evil,” she said.
     
            One year after several of his family members were kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7 attack, Eylon Keshet said he knows life will never be the same again.
     
            “I’m really afraid that the next time I see them will be a very big funeral for all of them. This is what I dread the most,” he told CNN.
     
            His cousin Yarden Bibas, Yarden’s wife Shiri, and their two young children were all kidnapped from Nir Oz, an Israeli kibbutz that was devastated when it came under attack by Hamas militants on October 7.
     
            Keshet said even if his family members are still alive, nothing will be the same. He said every day since that attack has felt like October 7, 2023, repeated over and over.
     
            “Even if they’re coming back, and I so wish they do, they lost so much,” Keshet said. He said Shiri’s parents and their friends were killed and their house has been destroyed.
     
            “I know that even them coming back is only the beginning for them to heal and for them to maybe someday be able to move on from everything that’s happened. Shiri probably doesn’t even know that her parents were murdered,” he said.
     
            “It will never be the same before and after” the October 7 attack, Keshet added.
     
            As for the global response, he said empathy is not enough to bring back his family. Keshet said there needs to be “real action from real people that have the authority to make such action.”
     
            Twenty-two people were killed and 111 others were wounded in Israeli strikes on towns in southern Lebanon on Sunday, the Lebanese health ministry said.
     
            Since September 16, at least 1,448 people have been killed and 7,677 people have been wounded by Israeli offensive operations in Lebanon, according to a CNN tally based on the ministry’s figures.
     
            One humanitarian worker in Gaza said they “don’t have the luxury of grief” as she reflects on the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attacks that sparked the Israel-Hamas war.
     
            Lena, a worker for the non-profit organization Mercy Corps, said she has been displaced more than a dozen times since last year. She is currently living in a shelter in central Gaza. CNN is not using her real name due to concerns for her safety.
     
        “We don’t have the luxury to cry over the ruins of our destroyed homes. I haven’t been able to see my home since October 8, and I wasn’t able to retrieve a single memory from its rubble and shattered remains,” Lena said.
     
 
            “We haven’t put our clothes in wardrobes, bathed comfortably, had a meal with any sense of peace, slept on a proper bed, or had clean drinking water in over a year,” she added.
     
            Lena described the humanitarian situation in the enclave as “unbelievable.” She said that as a humanitarian worker, she has “seen firsthand the overwhelming needs in terms of shelter, food, and basic supplies.”
     
            “Every day brings new challenges, but we do our best to support vulnerable populations through emergency response programs, even when resources are stretched thin,” she said.
     
            Israel’s military has told people in Lebanon to avoid the coastline south of the Awali River and refrain from using boats — warning that it will soon take action against Hezbollah in the area.
     
            “For your safety, avoid being at sea or on the beach from now until further notice. Being on the beach or operating boats in the area south of the Awali River line poses a danger to your life,” Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X.
     
            Hundreds of people have gathered in Tel Aviv for the main memorial ceremony commemorating the victims of the October 7 terror attacks.
     
            The gathering in Tel Aviv’s Hayarkon Park is taking place under strict security measures, with entry restricted only to the families and friends of those who were killed or kidnapped by Hamas and other militant groups during the attack last year.
     
            The original plans to open the gathering to the public were scrapped after Israeli security authorities restricted attendance at events to 2,000 people following the Iranian missile attack last week.
     
            The families began the gathering by holding a minute’s silence which will be followed by speeches from some of the family members and survivors of the attack.
     
            The family of Yair Yaakov is among those attending the ceremony, and his son Yigal is among the speakers.
     
            Yaakov, 59, a resident of kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel was murdered on October 7, when terrorists stormed his home. His family, however, didn’t know about his death, believing he was taken hostage into Gaza, his brother Yaniv told CNN at the event in Tel Aviv.
     
            It wasn’t until February that they found out that he was killed and his body kidnapped into Gaza. Yaniv told CNN that bringing his brother’s body back home for burial is now “the most important thing” for the family, especially for his mother.
     
            “She is alive, but she’s not living. This is all she can think about,” he said.
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Friday and discuss the situation in the Middle East, according to the Russian state-run media outlet TASS.
     
            The pair will meet in Turkmenistan, TASS reported Monday, adding that the meeting was announced at a briefing by Putin’s aide Yuri Ushakov.
     
            “This meeting is of great importance, both for discussing bilateral issues and, of course, for discussing the sharply aggravated situation in the Middle East,” Ushakov said, according to TASS.
     
            At least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on northern Gaza’s Jabalya refugee camp on Monday, hospital officials said. A further 20 people have been injured, according to the Kamal Adwan Hospital.
     
            Footage from the scene showed multiple dead bodies lying in the street covered in blood.
     
            The Israeli military’s Arabic spokesperson had issued an evacuation order for the area on X around three hours before the strike.
     
            “For your safety, you must evacuate these areas immediately to the newly created humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi,” Avichay Adraee said in the post, adding that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was “operating with great force” in several areas of northern Gaza.
     
            Meanwhile, Gaza’s Ministry of Interior and National Security urged civilians “not to respond to the occupation’s threats to evacuate their homes.”
     
            “The occupation is working to deceive citizens by claiming the existence of safe corridors and displacement areas,” the ministry said, suggesting that the IDF is “executing citizens on their way to the southern Gaza Strip.”
     
            On Sunday, the IDF said that it had “encircled” the densely populated Jabalya refugee camp after it said it had detected the presence of Hamas members there.
     
            US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden commemorated the anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack at the White House Monday, lighting a yahrzeit candle and holding a moment of silence.
     
            The Bidens were joined by Rabbi Aaron Alexander of the Adas Israel Congregation. Rabbi Alexander, who is a friend of the Goldberg-Polin family, recited the “El Malei Rachamim” prayer as part of the commemoration.
     
            The Goldberg-Polin’s son, Hersh, was abducted by Hamas last year before ultimately being murdered by the terrorist group in August.
     
            Biden did not make any remarks and left the room following the moment of silence.
     
            Biden also gave his “deepest condolences” to the people of Israel and the families whose loved ones were killed during the October 7th terrorist attack in a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog this morning.
     
            Both leaders, according to a White House readout of the call, also “reaffirmed” their commitment to achieving a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.
     
This post has been updated with additional details.
 
            A mood of desperation consumes many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip who are living in dire humanitarian conditions, having endured 12 months of Israel’s bombardment of the enclave.
     
            “We have spent a year in war,” Abdallah Hmeida, a cancer patient displaced from Beit Lahia, told CNN in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah. Hmeida has lost his parents, his brother and his sisters in the conflict, he said.
     
            “It is torment. We do not know where to go, and we live in tents.”
     
            Nabila Shunnar, a displaced woman from Sheikh Radwan, said she has spent the last year “in fear, terror, hunger and tragedy.”
     
            Residents of Gaza told CNN they did not expect the fighting to drag on for a year and some now worry it may be endless, as they see no concrete efforts to cement a ceasefire.
     
            Some residents say they have been waiting months for the war to end only so they can bury their dead or retrieve their remains.
     
            Um Fadi, a displaced woman from northern Gaza who now shelters in Deir al-Balah, said she lost hope in the world’s ability to act in the face of the bloodshed. Living in tents with her husband and five children, Fadi fears for the coming winter, saying her family have no clothes that can shelter them from the cold.
     
            For Gazans, it has been 365 days “of suffering, poverty, hunger, disease, instability, and lack of security,” she told CNN.
     
            “We are bodies without souls,” she added.
     
            The Israeli military has said it intercepted a surface-to-surface missile fired from Yemen toward central Israel on Monday.
     
            The purported missile triggered sirens in the area, including in Tel Aviv.
     
            The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have not yet commented on the purported missile launch from that country.
     
            An Israeli strike caused a large blast near Beirut’s airport in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital on Monday.
     
            Big plumes of smoke were seen rising from the southern Dahiyeh neighborhood following the strike, though planes continued to depart and land at Beirut’s international airport.
     
            Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a precision attack in Beirut adding that more details will follow. It’s unclear if the incident Adraee was referring to is the same strike in southern Beirut.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has submitted a proprosal to rename the war launched following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks to “Resurrection War.”
     
            The conflict is currently named “Swords of Iron.”
     
            “This is the ‘resurrection war’ to ensure that October 7 never happens again,” Netanyahu said Monday at a government meeting marking the one-year anniversary of the attacks, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.
     
            “This is a war for our existence,” the prime minister said, adding the war will not end until all of its goals are completed, which include destroying Hamas, retrieving the hostages, “thwarting any future threat from Gaza” and returning evacuated citizens of the north back to their homes.
     
            Hamas’ attack a year ago was the worst atrocity on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Netanyahu said that “unlike during the Holocaust — we rose up against our enemies to fight a fierce war.”
     
            Opposition head Yair Lapid shot back at the prime minister’s suggested name. “You can change as many names as you’d like, (but) you won’t change the fact that under your watch, the worst catastrophe in Israel’s history has occurred,” Lapid wrote on Telegram. This government isn’t the government of resurrection, it is the government of blame.”
     
            The Hostage Families Forum in a statement said: “There is no and there won’t be a resurrection without returning all the hostages.”
     
            Israeli forces killed a 12-year-old boy during an incursion into a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Monday morning, Palestinian officials said.
     
            Hatem Sami Hisham Ghaith died after being shot by Israeli forces at the Qalandiya refugee camp, roughly five miles from Ramallah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The camp lies near the main checkpoint linking Ramallah with Jerusalem.
     
            The boy arrived at a local hospital, the Ramallah Palestine Medical Complex, with a bullet wound to his abdomen that later caused his intestines to rupture, the health ministry added.
     
            The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC) said its crews have been attending to eight people who had been injured by live bullets, and one person who was shot in the head with a rubber bullet.
     
            CNN has reached out to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the incident.
     
More on the raid: At least 22 Palestinian men from the camp were arrested by the Israeli soldiers, a representative for the camp told CNN. Video shared widely on social media showed Israeli troops escorting blindfolded handcuffed men on the streets on Monday.
     
            Videos show groups of teenagers burning tires and throwing stones in the direction of Israeli military vehicles.
     
            In one video filmed by Reuters news agency, teenagers can be seen running from the fires as several ambulances from the PRC arrived on the scene.
     
            In another video shared on social media, verified by CNN, Israeli soldiers can be seen shooting towards the area from which the stones are being thrown.
     
            The commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force Esmail Qaani has been absent from public events over the past week, prompting speculation that the top general may have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon.
     
            Iranian officials and state media rushed to dispel rumors of his death this weekend. “Many ask us what happened to General Qaani. He is healthy and active,” the deputy commander for the Quds Force, Iraj Masjedi, was cited as saying by Iran’s Tasnim news agency Monday. The Quds Force, or Jerusalem Force, is part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
     
            Iran’s state news agency said Qaani is not attending a conference for Palestinian children Monday to “attend an important meeting” without elaborating further.
     
            Qaani, who replaced Qassem Soleimani after the latter was killed by the United States in 2020, was notably absent from a ceremony held by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Sunday.
     
            Qaani was also absent from Khamenei’s rare Friday prayer sermon commemorating the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month.
     
            Reuters cited two-Iranian security sources saying Qaani traveled to Lebanon after Israel assassinated Nasrallah but has not been heard from since Thursday. Reuters cites one of the Iranian officials saying Qaani was in Beirut’s southern suburbs during a strike targeting Nasrallah’s possible successor Hashem Safieddine. CNN is not able to confirm the Reuters reporting and has reached out to the Iranian foreign ministry for comment.
     
            Hezbollah lost contact with Safieddine since an Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs targeted him, a Lebanese security source told CNN earlier.
     
            After succeeding Soleimani, Qaani took charge of Iran’s vast paramilitary network across the Middle East. He is sanctioned by the US, the UK and other Western nations.
     
            At least 10 firefighters were killed after an Israeli strike hit a fire station in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said on Monday.
     
            The firefighters were in the building in the town of Baraachit “preparing to set out on rescue missions” before the strike destroyed the building, the ministry said.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. The Lebanese health ministry said debris is still being removed from the destroyed fire station.
     
            The Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders to residents in northern and in southern Gaza on Monday, as it ramps up its military operation in both parts of the enclave.
     
            The areas under evacuation in the north include Beit Hanoun, the Jabaliya refugee camp and Beit Lahia. In the south, Gazans were warned to evacuate Bani Suhaila, Al-Mahta, Sheikh Nasser and Maan, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it is responding with “extreme force” to “Hamas terrorist actions” in those areas.
     
            The southern Gaza order came just one hour after the IDF renewed an evacuation order asking residents to evacuate multiple areas in the north and move southwards toward Al-Mawasi – a coastal region in Khan Younis where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled Israel’s bombardment from other parts of Gaza.
     
            Residents who spoke to CNN said they feel there is no safe place to go to.
     
Several killed: Before the announcement of the new evacuation notice, the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza said it received people with several “artillery fire” injuries from Beit Lahia.
     
            The hospital said that five men were killed, and a “number” of others injured “after being struck by a drone strike in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza.” The dead and wounded were brought to the northern medical facility.
     
More context: Gaza’s north is witnessing renewed strikes. The Israeli military on Sunday said it launched a new ground operation in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya, encircling the area after seeing signs of Hamas rebuilding, despite nearly a year of fighting and strikes in the territory.
     
            Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters are engaged “in fierce clashes at zero distance with the enemy forces” in Jabaliya.
     
            The orders come as Israel marks the one-year anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attack, and as the IDF launches several strikes throughout the strip, saying it had “thwarted” threats.
     
This post has been updated with more details on the evacuation orders in Gaza. 
 
            Some families of the Americans believed to be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza spoke with two senior White House officials on Sunday, a source familiar with the call said.
     
            The call with senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein, who traveled to Israel last month, and White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk came one day before the anniversary of the October 7th terror attack against Israel.
     
            In a statement Monday morning, US President Joe Biden renewed his calls for a ceasefire deal that would secure the release of hostages even as those talks have gained little traction in recent weeks.
     
        “Today and every day, I think of the hostages and their families. I have met the families of the hostages and grieved with them. They have been through hell. My Administration has negotiated for the safe release of more than 100 hostages, including Americans. We will never give up until we bring all of the remaining hostages home safely,” the president wrote in the statement.
     
 
            “We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel’s security, and ends this war. Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in security, dignity, and peace,” he added.
     
            President Biden said on Saturday that he would be speaking with the hostage families, but it’s unclear whether any of those conversations might happen today.
     
            The White House did not immediately comment on the hostage families’ call with McGurk and Hochstein on Sunday.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has paid tribute to the “fallen of Jerusalem” in a joint event with the city’s major, one year after the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
     
            Netanyahu and Moshe Leon lit candles at the “Iron Swords” monument erected in Jerusalem in honor of the victims.
     
            “We went through a terrible massacre a year ago, and we stood up as a people, as lions. The people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up themselves as a young lion,” the pair said in a statement on Monday.
     
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile issued a lengthy statement remembering the “nightmare of a brutal attack” and pledging to win “a war against enemies on 7 different fronts.”
     
            “The peaceful communities, the site of a music festival, the agricultural lands – the beautiful region of southern Israel, was scorched by bloodthirsty murderers with only one wish in their hearts – the total destruction and annihilation of Israel,” Gallant said.
     
            “On this painful day, more than ever, we are eternally committed to the security and continuity of the State of Israel and her people.”
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it intercepted five projectiles launched from the northern Gaza strip on Monday.
     
            Earlier in the day, the Israeli military said nine projectiles had been launched from southern Gaza, injuring two people.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin offered the United States’ “unwavering” commitment to Israel’s security during a call Sunday with his Israeli counterpart on the eve of the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, according to a readout of the call.
     
        “Secretary Austin noted that tomorrow marks one year since Hamas perpetrated the worst terrorist attack against Israel in its history, and he reiterated unwavering U.S. commitment to Israel’s security, a ceasefire in Gaza, and a diplomatic resolution that enables citizens to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border,” the readout said.
     
 
            Secretary Austin reiterated to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant the US position that Israel has a right to defend itself and noted the US maintains “significant capability” to defend US personnel and to support Israel’s self-defense.
     
            Austin also expressed his condolences for two Israeli soldiers killed in an attack on October 3 and wished a “full recovery for those who were injured.”
     
            Austin and Gallant also emphasized their commitment to “deterring Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from taking advantage of the situation or expanding the conflict.”
     
            President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris marked one year since the deadly October 7 attack in Israel with statements commemorating the “solemn” anniversary and calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal.
     
        “We will not stop working to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel’s security, and ends this war. Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in security, dignity, and peace,” Biden wrote in a written statement.
     
 
            He also said: “On this solemn anniversary, let us bear witness to the unspeakable brutality of the October 7th attacks but also to the beauty of the lives that were stolen that day.”
     
            Harris and Biden also both called for a diplomatic solution amid the now-expanding war between Hezbollah and Israel. And both leaders reiterated US support for Israel’s right to defend itself in the face of attacks by Iran.
     
            “It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people. And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination. We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes,” Harris wrote.
     
            And the vice president said she is “devastated” by the loss and pain felt since the October 7 attack, which launched the war in Gaza.
     
            “We will not forget, and we will not lose faith. And in honor of all those souls we lost on October 7, we must never lose sight of the dream of peace, dignity, and security for all,” she wrote.
     
            Israel is marking the first anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks — an assault that left more than 1,200 people dead and more than 200 taken hostage. A number of vigils and memorial events are taking place across the country on a somber date.
     
            But the region remains engulfed by war on several fronts, and fighting has continued in Gaza, Lebanon and within Israel on Monday.
     
            Israel has launched a new offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, forcing hundreds of Palestinians to flee, and it continues to mull an anticipated retaliation against Iran for last week’s barrage of missiles.
     
            Here’s what you need to know:
     
            It is almost impossible to remember life in Israel before Hamas launched its brutal October 7 attacks a year ago. There is little point, because that life is gone for good. And not just because more than 100 hostages are still captive.
     
            The same is true beyond Israel’s borders.
     
            Israel, its enemies and allies are all harbingers and painful witnesses to a remaking of the region’s diplomatic and political architecture on a scale that could rival the upheavals of the Arab-Israeli conflict a half-century ago.
     
            The post-October 7 changes are both inevitable and, in their current chaotic form at least, preventable. The civilian cost is mounting when diplomacy might have saved lives.
     
            A year ago it seemed the political architecture of the region was on the cusp of significant change. Propelled by US incentives, Saudi Arabia and Israel seemed closer than ever to a historic normalization of relations. Diplomacy and the deft skills needed to stitch such a complex deal together were in the ascendency.
     
            But the prospect of approaching peace and prosperity evaporated as Hamas surged through the Gaza border fences at sunrise that Saturday morning. Butchery was afoot.
     
            Irrespective of whether Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was calculating he could torpedo normalization and push the Palestinian cause ahead of regional priorities for peace and economic integration, in the short term he succeeded.
     
Read the full analysis.
 
            At least two people were wounded in Israel after Hamas launched rockets from Gaza this morning.
     
            Israel’s military said nine projectiles were launched from southern Gaza into Israel.
     
            Hamas’ military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said it struck “the depth of the occupation, the city of Tel Aviv, with a barrage of M90 rockets.”
     
            Israel’s Emergency Services, MDA, treated two women with mild “shrapnel injuries” in Kfar Chabad, just southeast of Tel Aviv, following the attack.
     
            A CNN team on the ground in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where an October 7 memorial service was taking place, saw what appeared to be the smoke trails left by several rockets in the sky.
     
            Rocket strikes from Gaza into Israel have become increasingly rare over the past year as Israel has degraded Hamas’ military capabilities in its war on the group.
     
            Israel’s military said it had “thwarted an immediate threat” on Monday by striking “Hamas launch posts and underground terrorist infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip.”
     
            Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that the Hamas-led October 7 attacks last year “set the Zionist regime (Israel) back 70 years.”
     
            He made the statement in a Hebrew-language X post sent at 6:29 a.m. Israel time on Monday, the exact time the attacks started a year ago.
     
            At the exact same time, the Israeli military posted on X: “One year ago today, our country’s history was forever changed.”
     
            Khamenei led a rare sermon in Tehran on Friday to commemorate the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last month, during which he praised Hamas’ October 7 attack and described it as “legitimate.”
     
            Hamas and Hezbollah are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” an alliance of Islamist militant groups spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen.
     
            A memorial ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack has ended in Israel’s Kibbutz Nir Oz, just a few miles from Gaza.
     
            The agricultural commune of 400 people was among the worst impacted by the attack, with one in four residents murdered or kidnapped.
     
            The Bibas family — husband and wife Yarden and Shiri, their young son Ariel, and baby Kfir — were among those kidnapped on that day. They, along with more than 20 others from the kibbutz, are still being held in Gaza.
     
            In a particularly poignant moment, the names of those murdered in the kibbutz last year were read aloud. The speakers struggled to get through the long list of names, pausing to take a moment when their emotions became too raw.
     
            “We cannot move on when people from the kibbutz are still there, Amat Moshe, whose grandparents were residents of the kibbutz, told CNN before the event started.
     
        “Time has stopped here.”
     
 
            Last October, Moshe’s grandmother Adina watched the as Hamas fighters stormed her home and murdered her husband David before kidnapping her to Gaza. She was released as part of a ceasefire deal in November last year.
     
            Most of Nir Oz’s residents have yet to return, living together in the town of Kiryat Gat, about an hour’s drive away. Only six have come back.
     
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog was among those present at the commemoration. He also attended a memorial held at the Nova festival site earlier in the morning.
     
            As people gathered to mark the anniversary, the Israeli military reported that several projectiles were fired from Gaza toward Israel. Throughout the morning, the sounds of outgoing artillery fire could be heard, as the military continued striking targets inside Gaza.
     
            Several Palestinian fathers in Gaza told CNN their families cannot face another wave of displacement, as Israeli forces launched renewed aerial and ground attacks in northern Gaza on Sunday.
     
            CNN footage from Jabalya showed boys riding bicycles and vendors manning thinly stocked market stalls yesterday. Echoes of young children filled the area as women walked wearily along the dusty pathway. The Israeli military told people to evacuate Gaza’s north to the Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” of Al-Mawasi in Khan Younis.
     
            But residents say they are wary of attempting to flee the besieged neighborhood in search of refuge, citing numerous Israeli attacks targeting Hamas militants in Israeli-designated “safe zones.”
     
        “I don’t know where to go,” one man with grey stubble told CNN. “What did we do? We have children, we have women, we have the elderly. Where should we all go? What should we do? Should we kill ourselves?
     
 
            “I will die and not go to the south,” he said, adding that he was trying to protect 20 other relatives from Israel’s bombardment. “We are resisting and will not leave the north, even if I die here.”
     
            The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has displaced 1.9 million people, according to the UN. On Sunday, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees warned that the enclave “has become a place unfit for humans,” citing destruction, hunger and disease.
     
        “They have humiliated us and lied to us… My entire family lives in the south in a tent, and they are not safe at all,” Mohammad Ibrahim, a father-of-two in Jabalya, told CNN over the phone.
     
 
            The history teacher said he would rather stay with his two sons at their home, preferring to die “with dignity.”
     
            “There are many like me who will stay in Jabalya. We have no friends, relatives, or real safe shelter, and since death is the same, we will remain.”
     
Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.
 
            Idan Shtivi, who was thought to have been killed during Hamas’ attack on October 7 last year, has been confirmed dead, according to the Hostages and Families Forum Headquarters.
     
            The forum said his body is being held in Gaza.
     
            Shtivi attended the Nova music festival and was killed at the site, the forum said.
     
            One year since the October 7 attacks, people in Gaza remain desperate for relief from Israel’s unrelenting offensive, a United Nations official in the enclave told CNN.
     
            “People here remain desperate. Hostages remain in Gaza, their families wait for them,” Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN humanitarian affairs (UNOCHA) suboffice in Gaza, told CNN’s Rosemary Church.
     
        “Even at 4 a.m. this morning, we were woken up by renewed bombing here in Rafah, Gaza … From jets buzzing, shelling and tank fire. The only thing that’s left in Gaza, would say is hope. Our supplies are almost zero.”
     
 
            The Israeli military launched a new offensive in northern Gaza this weekend, days before the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks, which killed over 1,200 people.
     
            The war in Gaza – which Israel says is aimed at destroying Hamas – has killed more than 41,000 people and triggered a dire humanitarian crisis.
     
            Petropoulos said almost 100,000 are wounded in the ongoing war and an unknown number of people – possibly in the thousands – remain under rubble across Gaza.
     
        “There’s fighting around, there’s no safe locations.”
     
 
            There are an estimated 430,000 people left in northern Gaza, Petropoulos said, and not many of those displaced are motivated to move south due to the lack of supplies all over.
     
        “If 430,000 people are pushed to come south, I have to be very clear – no idea where we will put them, what we will give them to eat, and how we will shelter these people.”
     
 
            The intensified bombardment and the advance of the Israeli forces means that around 50,000 people have been displaced in the last 24 hours from the northern communities of Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabalya, Petropoulos said.
     
            Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have sounded a siren for two minutes outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem to urge him to bring back their loved ones, marking one year since they were kidnapped by Hamas.
     
            Following Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage, the families have campaigned relentlessly for the Israeli government to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would secure the release of their loved ones.
     
            On Monday, the relatives spoke about the immense grief and trauma they have experienced, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
     
        “A year has passed since that Saturday morning when my parents woke up in panic and ran to the safe room. A year since terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz. A year of mortal fear that no one can understand,” said Shir Siegel, whose parents were kidnapped and taken to Gaza.
     
 
            Siegel’s mother, Aviva Siegel, was released after two months in captivity, but her father, Keith Siegel, remains a hostage.
     
            “A year has passed since I imagined my parents coming home and us hugging. A year has passed, but it feels like one long day,” Siegel said.
     
            Some relatives also expressed messages of hope and resilience.
     
            “Omeri, my life. I miss you. I feel your absence with every breath, every moment in my body,” said Niva Wenkert, whose son Omer was kidnapped at the Nova music festival last year.
     
        “We’re not giving up, my life, I’m not giving up for a second,” she said. “We’re here, we’ll win until you’re home.”
     
 
            An Israeli strike on the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza has killed three people and wounded several more, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS).
     
            The wounded have been transferred to Al Awda Hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp, PRCS said.
     
            The Israeli military said it struck multiple locations in Gaza overnight, describing them as Hamas “targets and launchers.”
     
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog was among those holding commemorations this morning at the Nova festival site, where he described the October 7 attacks as a “scar on the face of the Earth” and called for countries to support Israel.
     
            Herzog also laid a wreath and lit memorial candles in honor of those killed at the site a year ago, accompanied by their bereaved families.
     
        “October 7, 2023, is a day that should be remembered in infamy, when thousands of cruel terrorists broke into our homes, violated our families, burned, chopped, raped, and hijacked and abducted our citizens, our brothers and sisters, and with them, people from 36 different nationalities,” Herzog said.
     
 
            The atmosphere at the memorial site was somber as family members, friends of victims and survivors consoled each other.
     
        “Blessed be those who fell, who were murdered and killed here. Young people who came to celebrate and enjoy dance and music — to live a real life of young people as any young person should be entitled to. Let us remember them forever. Let us pray, with remorse, pain, bereavement, and condolences to their families,” Hertzog said.
     
 
            An overnight Israeli drone strike on tents housing displaced Palestinians at a hospital compound in Gaza has wounded 11 people, including children and journalists, according to a medical source at the facility.
     
            The Israeli military said it targeted a Hamas “command and control center” in an airstrike on the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital compound in Deir el Balah, central Gaza.
     
            The military said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, “including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.”
     
            On Sunday, at least 21 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the nearby Al Aqsa Martyrs mosque, where displaced Palestinians were sheltering. Casualties from that attack were evacuated to the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
     
            The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas “command and control center.”
     
            The Israeli military has called on “all residents of Lebanese villages who have evacuated their homes” not to return home “until further notice.”
     
            Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said that Israeli strikes are continuing.
     
            Adraee has been posting multiple messages daily warning residents of over 120 towns and villages throughout Lebanon, calling on them to leave their homes and evacuate.
     
            Lebanese authorities say over 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month. Many have been housed temporarily in schools across the country, or camped out on sidewalks, in parks, churches and mosques.
     
            Scorch marks and bullet holes scar the battered walls of the Haran family home in kibbutz Be’eri. Its tiled roof has caved in, windows smashed, littering the floors with sharp shards of terracotta and glass – the debris, still untouched, of a day of horror for Israel.
     
            “This house tells the story of Be’eri,” says Yarden Tzemach, a farmer and surviving resident of the kibbutz, one of the Israeli communities near Gaza that was overrun by Hamas militants last year.
     
        “In this house, people were murdered. A family, including three children, were kidnapped from here,” he says.
     
 
            Outside, beneath the fruit trees in the back yard, a toddler’s ride-on toy car, adorned with stickers of Winnie the Pooh, sits amid the rubble, a stark reminder of the lives shattered here.
     
            In some neighborhoods of Be’eri, barely a building was left intact. More than 100 of its 1,100 residents were killed and another 30 abducted to Gaza on October 7.
     
            Home after home was burned out or reduced to rubble and – a year on – many remain as poignant monuments to an ongoing trauma. At least 10 residents of the kibbutz, all friends and neighbors of each other, are among the more than 100 Israelis believed to still be held hostage.
     
            Nearly 100 residents to have so far returned, with some working to bring kibbutz Be’eri, formerly a self-sustaining farming community, back to life.

            The song that played as Hamas militants stormed the Nova music festival last year was replayed Monday during a memorial for those killed at the site in the October 7 attacks.
     
            In an emotional moment for family and friends of those killed and kidnapped to Gaza, the track was played – and then stopped abruptly – at the same time as last year.
     
            Many of those gathered at the memorial cried, hugged and comforted each other while recalling their loved ones’ final moments.
     
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog attended the ceremony, speaking to families of those murdered here and walking through the memorial field.
     
            The family of Gabriel Barel — his three brothers, mother and best friend — huddled around a portrait of Barel planted amid hundreds of similar memorials.
     
            Barel was 22 when he was killed at the festival. For weeks after the massacre, his family didn’t know what happened to him. He was shot while driving away from the site and the car was subsequently burned, which made identifying his remains extremely difficult.
     
            His brother Yeoda Barel said Gabriel was not meant to go to the party.
     
            “He didn’t have a ticket, but he managed to sneak in and danced all night,” he said.
     
            Yeoda said Gabriel left the festival shortly after the first rockets were fired from Gaza, when he got a call from his mother in the city of Ashkelon.
     
        “She was on her own and was scared from the rockets, so he was going to go to her. He was concerned about her, not himself,” Yeoda, the youngest of Gabriel’s brothers, told CNN.
     
 
            Yeoda and Gabriel’s best friend from the military, Noam, said he was a fun-loving guy, always surrounded by friends and saving up for a big trip to South America.
     
            To pay tribute to Gabriel’s outgoing personality, the group gathered around his portrait and took a selfie, smiling for the camera.
     
        “I miss him every day,” Yeoda said.
     
 
            After rushing to comfort Israel as it grieved the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, US President Joe Biden last year pledged America would stand with the country in its dark days and the good ones he insisted would come.
     
            At the time, no one knew the international and domestic political consequences of his promise. An ensuing war has proved the existential role the US plays in Israel’s survival but also severely strained the alliance. It has also exposed and widened some of America’s most profound political divides ahead of an already tumultuous US election.
     
            The October 7 attacks did not only transform the Middle East’s strategic balance as Israel confronted Hamas, then Hezbollah, and traded fire with their sponsor, its archenemy, Iran. The horror set off a chain of events that affected countless lives, unleashing political disturbances thousands of miles away.
     
Militarily, the United States and its allies have twice staged unprecedented operations to protect Israel from a barrage of missiles and drones from Iran. The US has also repeatedly bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have launched attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea in the wake of October 7.
     
            Israel’s onslaught on Hamas in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians, may have finally shattered US hopes of a two-state solution. And it’s turned into the greatest foreign crisis of the Biden administration.

            Children in Lebanon are suffering severe injuries from strikes and shrapnel, a spokesperson for the United Nations Children agency said Monday, as Israel’s war with Hezbollah intensifies.
     
            “The toll of this conflict has escalated in recent weeks and is really, really taking a tremendous toll on the children here… in terms of the numbers killed and injured but also displaced,” UNICEF spokesperson Tess Ingram told CNN’s Michael Holmes.
     
        “Doctors that I’ve spoken to have told us that children have scars of war, both physically and mentally.”
     
 
            Ingram said the most common injuries were shrapnel wounds, and some children have also suffered brain injuries, concussions and limb injuries from being thrown by blasts. Children are also experiencing anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks.
     
            Israel’s attacks on Hezbollah have killed more than 1,400 people in Lebanon in recent weeks, according to its health ministry, and created a humanitarian crisis.
 
            UNICEF says more than 690 children have been wounded in Lebanon as the conflict escalated in the last six weeks, and more than 400,000 children have been displaced from their homes as families try to flee from strikes.
     
        “People have been displaced from the south of Lebanon, but also the southern suburbs in Beirut where the strikes have been really intensive, particularly these last few days there have been consistent at nighttime, but also increasingly during the day now.”
     
 
            Lebanese authorities say over 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month. Many have been housed temporarily in schools across the country.
     
            Idit Ohel, mother of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel, said she was out walking the dog on the morning of October 7 when her family began to realize that something had happened at the Nova music festival.
     
            At around 8 a.m. her son sent a message saying he was in a bomb shelter but was fine. A few hours later, they received a phone call saying he was sent to a hospital. But when her husband arrived there, they received news that Alon had been kidnapped alive and taken to Gaza.
     
            Ohel told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga “what Hamas did is not human,” and urged governments around the world to help rescue hostages still held in Gaza.
     
        “We need them to come home. We need everybody to be there for us and do everything in their power to bring them home.”
     
 
            Ohel said her son “was the glue” that brought her family together, and said he loved music and playing the piano.
     
        “Alon just went to the Nova festival, trying to have fun and was taken from Israeli land, and he did nothing wrong,” Ohel said. “And I say to everyone, to every mother, Alon is not just my son, he’s everyone’s son.
     
 
            “He just loves life,” Ohel said of her son. “He came back home, a month and a half before he was kidnapped, from traveling over Asia. And in meeting people and finding interesting, different kinds of food.”
     
            Fighting continues in the Middle East on the first anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza, with commemorations planned across Israel and around the world.
     
            Hezbollah struck the northern Israeli city of Haifa for what appeared to be the first time in its ongoing conflict with Israel. Beirut has seen some of the most intense bombing by Israel in its war against Hezbollah, which has further escalated the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon.
     
            Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran for last week’s missile barrage, and its military has launched a new offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, forcing hundreds of Palestinians to flee.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            Everything changed at 6:29 a.m. on October 7 last year at the Nova music festival in the Negev desert, said event co-founder Ofir Amir.
     
            “A year has passed but we still feel like we are on October 7, (like) it was just a long day that never ends,” Amir told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga from Israel.
     
        “The dance floor is supposed to be the safest place on Earth where it doesn’t matter where you come from, you can be whatever you want to be. We believe that when you are on the dance floor it doesn’t matter who you are, what religion, what color we all the same,” he said.
     
 
            “It’s still unimaginable what happened on that day.”
     
            Amir, who was shot in both legs, was among the last people to leave the festival site.
     
            Hamas fighters killed 347 people and took others hostage at the festival on October 7 last year, according to the Israeli military.
     
            Also speaking to CNN, Yariv Mozer, director of “We Will Dance Again” — a documentary on the festival attack — said it was important to chronicle how the events unfolded, minute-by-minute, using footage from survivors and videos taken by Hamas fighters as evidence of the brutality they faced that day.
     
            Hundreds of family members and friends are gathering for a ceremony honoring those killed in Hamas’ attack at the site of the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel on October 7.
     
            Danielle Cohen, whose cousin Mor Meir Trabalsi was murdered while trying to escape the attack, attended alongside several friends and family members. The group, all wearing blue t-shirts with Trabalsi’s name and photograph printed on them, gathered at a small memorial to honor him, one of hundreds erected on the site.
     
            Trabalsi was shot dead while driving his wife and friends away from the festival. He told everyone in the car to duck down and kept going — likely saving their lives while losing his.
     
            The survivors, including his new wife, were trapped in the car with Trabalsi’s body for about five hours before the Israeli army rescued them, Cohen said.
     
        “He was 27 years old and got married just one month before,” Cohen told CNN. “He was the best cousin that you can wish that you would have. He was the glue of our family.”
     
 
            Cohen said Trabalsi’s wedding was the biggest she’s ever been to, with more than 800 people attending.
     
            “It’s unusual for Israeli weddings to be that big, but Mor had more friends than people I know in my life. He was that person that is always surrounded by friends, and everybody wanted to be his friend,” she said, a tear rolling down her face.
     
            “Looking back, the wedding was like a big farewell party for him.”
     
            At just after 5:30 a.m. in Israel, people began gathering at the site of the Nova Music Festival, where Hamas militants murdered 347 people and took 40 others hostage on October 7 last year.
     
            The event Monday in the Negev desert is the first of several gatherings to mark the one-year anniversary of the attacks that killed more than 1,200 people, saw more than 250 taken hostage and triggered Israel’s devastating war in Gaza.
     
            While the atmosphere at the memorial site is somber, reminders of the conflict are ever present. Just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Gaza perimeter, the sound of outgoing artillery rounds echoes through the quiet morning every few minutes as the sun begins to rise.
     
            At least five people were wounded in Haifa on Sunday following a Hezbollah rocket attack that appeared to mark the first time the Iran-backed militant group has struck the northern Israeli city in its ongoing conflict with Israel.
     
            Hezbollah said in a statement that it launched the rockets at Israel’s Carmel military base, while Israeli authorities reported rockets and shrapnel dropping around the city.
     
            Haifa’s Rambam Hospital said it was treating six people who were impacted by the attack. One person was “lightly to moderately injured” and four others were “lightly injured” due to shrapnel, it said. A sixth person was being treated for anxiety, it added.
     
            Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency services said it treated two people at the scene — a 13-year-old boy with a head injury caused by shrapnel and a 22-year-old man who was hit by a window that fell due to the blast.
     
            Debris and shrapnel were reported by police and bomb disposal experts in two primary areas, according to the police.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said earlier that it had spotted five projectiles fired toward the city and tried to intercept them, but several of the rockets landed.
     
            Israeli officials say Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets across the border Sunday. Israel continued with its extensive bombing campaign on southern Beirut and surrounding areas in Lebanon, which has killed more than 1,400 people over the past two weeks, according to Lebanese authorities.
     
CNN’s Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.
 
            There were demonstrations, marches and memorials across the world this weekend ahead of the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel.
     
            Large crowds marched through the streets of Barcelona, Jakarta, Sydney, and other cities on Sunday, marking a year since the attacks, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel. Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry there, and created a dire humanitarian crisis.
     
            Miguel Verdugo, a 72-year-old protester in Barcelona, told Reuters: “We must express that we are against genocide. The least we should all do is protest in every capital city around the world.”
     
        “Violence doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The occupation, the apartheid that has been going on in Israel of the Palestinian people, the siege of Gaza, the absolute illegal settlement, the brutality in the West Bank, it has to stop,” protester Sam Gazal told Reuters in Sydney.
     
 
            There were tributes and memorials for the victims of the Hamas attacks in cities across the world.
     
            Events were held in Berlin, Paris, London and Israel on Sunday, while the Pope led a prayer for peace at the Basilica of Saint Mary Major.
     
            In Berlin, hundreds of people rallied under the slogan, “United against the crimes of Hamas against Israelis and Palestinians,” Reuters reported.
     
            Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal spoke at the Berlin event, saying of the October 7 victims:
     
        “We will never forget them. We stand together with them and we pray to God that the hostages will come home now,” according to Reuters.
     
 
            In Tel Aviv, Thousands gathered for a vigil marking the anniversary, where loved ones mourned victims and survivors shared their stories. Protesters are urging Israel’s government to secure a deal to free the remaining hostages.
     
            The Israeli military has reinforced soldiers near Gaza ahead of the ceremonial events marking one year since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks into southern Israel.
     
            Additional troops have been deployed at border communities for both “defensive and offensive scenarios,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday.
     
            “The soldiers are fully equipped to defend the region in coordination with local security forces, the Israel Police, and Magen David Adom, ensuring a comprehensive response to any incidents that may arise,” the IDF said.
     
            A week before Israel marked the anniversary of the Hamas attacks, Israel launched a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon as it ratcheted up its war with the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.
     
            For the first time since 2006, Israel struck central Beirut, with previous attacks being confined to the city’s southern suburbs. Israel is now pounding Lebanon with a level of bombardment not seen outside of Gaza in the last 20 years, according to air warfare experts.
     
            The dramatic escalation in the Middle East suggests fears of an expanded regional war have been realized.
     
            Those fears have only been deepened by Iran’s largest-ever missile attack on Israel — which also came last week. The region is bracing for Israel’s response, and Tehran has already pledged it will attack Israel again if it deems that necessary.

            The event Monday in the Negev desert is the first of several gatherings to mark the one-year anniversary of the attacks that killed more than 1,200 people, saw more than 250 taken hostage and triggered Israel’s devastating war in Gaza.
     
            While the atmosphere at the memorial site is somber, reminders of the conflict are ever present. Just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Gaza perimeter, the sound of outgoing artillery rounds echoes through the quiet morning every few minutes as the sun begins to rise.
     
            US Vice President Kamala Harris will mark Monday’s one-year anniversary of the October 7 attacks in Israel at her Naval Observatory residence, where, along with second gentleman Doug Emhoff, she’ll plant a memorial tree, according to a White House official.
     
            Second families have traditionally planted trees on the grounds of the vice president’s residence. Monday’s planting of a pomegranate tree — which, among other things, represents hope and righteousness in Judaism — will mark the first for Harris and Emhoff while they’ve been at the residence, according to the official.
     
            The escalating violence in the Middle East has been one of the thorniest issues for Harris as she’s taken over the Democratic ticket this year. Arab American advocates and leaders have pushed for the vice president to distance herself from President Joe Biden’s Israel policy, including during a meeting in Michigan on Friday.

            Flights resumed in Iran late on Sunday night as authorities lifted aviation restrictions just two hours after they were imposed, state media reported.
     
            Earlier, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization had said flights at the country’s airports would be canceled overnight Sunday into Monday, and its airspace partially closed due to “military exercises” nightly until at least October 9.
     
            The temporary restrictions were implemented ahead of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel and as Israel mulls its retaliation to an Iranian missile barrage last week.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it struck multiple Hezbollah targets in Beirut Sunday evening.
     
            The Israeli Air Force (IAF) said it conducted strikes on Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters, a weapons storage facility and other sites in Beirut, and also hit Hezbollah targets in the Beqaa area of southern Lebanon including storage facilities, a command  center and a launcher.
     
            The IDF said Hezbollah had “deliberately embedded” its command centers and weapons storage facilities under residential buildings in Beirut, endangering civilians.
     
            A CNN team witnessed multiple explosions lighting up the skies of Beirut Sunday night.
     
            Hezbollah said it also launched a barrage of rockets at northern Israel Sunday night.
     
            At least five people were injured in Haifa on Sunday following a Hezbollah rocket attack that appeared to mark the first time the Iran-backed militant group has struck the northern Israeli city in its ongoing conflict with Israel.
     
            Hezbollah said in a statement that it launched the rockets at Israel’s Carmel military base, while Israeli authorities reported rockets and shrapnel dropping around the city.
     
            Haifa’s Rambam Hospital said it was treating six people who were impacted by the attack. One person was “lightly to moderately injured” and four others were “lightly injured” due to shrapnel, it said. A sixth person was being treated for anxiety, it added.
     
            Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency services said it treated two people at the scene — a 13-year-old boy with a head injury caused by shrapnel and a 22-year-old man who was hit by a window that fell due to the blast.
     
            Debris and shrapnel were reported by police and bomb disposal experts in two primary areas, according to the police.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said earlier that it had spotted five projectiles fired toward the city and tried to intercept them, but several of the rockets landed.
     
            Israeli officials say Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets across the border Sunday. Israel continued with its extensive bombing campaign on southern Beirut and surrounding areas in Lebanon, which has killed more than 1,400 people over the past two weeks, according to Lebanese authorities.

            Thousands of people joined a vigil Sunday in an area of Tel Aviv known as Hostages Square, where survivors of the October 7 attacks and the families of some of those killed spoke out on the eve of the one-year anniversary.
     
            Survivor Sapir Cohen shared with the crowd, “In captivity, I saw a girl curled up like a fetus, shaking, and a man sitting with his eyes closed for hours, refusing to open them or be part of the situation.”
     
            She described how she had tried to stay positive.
     
        “At that moment, I realized God had sent me to a place where I could do something truly meaningful — I could help the other hostages. From that point on, I didn’t care if I would continue to live or what would happen to me. I simply put all my problems aside and transformed from a fearful person with many anxieties into a strong, confident individual.”
     
 
            Cohen was released from Hamas captivity after 55 days. Her partner, Sasha Troufanov remains in captivity.
     
            Noam Peri, whose father Chaim Peri was killed in Hamas captivity, also addressed the crowd, recalling how her family had spent the eve of the tragedy:
     
            “For the first time, my father shared his story from the Yom Kippur War with us. It was a sad yet moving evening, with all of us united. At this very hour last year, we were still sitting and listening to him recount that first evening of October 6, 1973, when he traveled from Nir Oz deep into the Sinai. We listened intently, and at the end of the night, we said our goodbyes with hugs, kisses, and great love.”
     
            Chaim Peri was kidnapped from the Nir Oz kibbutz on October 7. His body was recovered by the Israeli military along with the bodies of five other hostages in mid-August.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces says over 120 projectiles have been fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon into Israeli territory Sunday.
     
            In Beirut this evening, a CNN team witnessed multiple explosions on the skyline.
     
            Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Israeli aircraft had targeted the Roueiss area in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
     
Remember: Israel has launched an extensive bombing campaign against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, which has a significant presence in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital. Israeli bombing has forced hundreds of thousands of Lebanese people to flee.
     
            Hezbollah has been firing rockets back across the border into northern Israel, where tens of thousands of residents have also been displaced.
     
            The Israeli military called for more evacuations in southern Lebanon late Sunday after pounding southern Beirut and surrounding areas with some of its most intense bombing of the current campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group.
     
            The announcement echoed a series of previous warnings, now affecting a total of 124 villages, as Israel says it is striking Hezbollah targets embedded in civilian areas. That has forced hundreds of thousands of Lebanese people to flee the onslaught, and more than 1,400 have been killed so far, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            Meanwhile, Israeli officials have vowed retaliation for Iran’s largest-ever attack on the country — a missile barrage launched last Tuesday — and have begun a new military operation in northern Gaza, where the Israel Defense Forces says it saw signs of Hamas regrouping.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            United Nations peacekeepers are “deeply concerned” over recent Israel Defense Forces activities near their position in southern Lebanon, according to a statement posted on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) X account on Sunday.
     
            UNIFIL stated that these activities took place within Lebanese territory at their position just southeast of the village of Maroun El-Ras village.
     
            UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told CNN that they are endangered because of the exchanges of fire between the IDF and Hezbollah: “Our position is in between, and they have installed a post close to our base.” So, both Hezbollah and the IDF are putting them in danger, Tenenti added.
     
            The UNIFIL X post noted that it has repeatedly raised the issue with the IDF through established communication channels. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
     
            On Wednesday, Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammad Afif announced that the group had engaged in clashes with the IDF in Maroun El-Ras.
     
            Several Palestinian fathers told CNN their families cannot face another wave of displacement, as Israeli forces launched renewed aerial and ground attacks in northern Gaza.
     
            CNN footage from Jabalya showed boys riding bicycles and vendors manning thinly stocked market stalls on Sunday. Echoes of young children fill the area, as woman walk wearily along the dusty pathway. The Israeli military told people to evacuate Gaza’s north to the Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” of Al-Mawasi in Khan Younis.
     
            But residents say they are wary of attempting to flee the besieged neighborhood in search of refuge, citing numerous Israeli attacks targeting Hamas militants in Israeli-designated “safe zones.”
     
        “I don’t know where to go,” one man with grey stubble told CNN. “What did we do? We have children, we have women, we have the elderly. Where should we all go? What should we do? Should we kill ourselves?
     
 
            “I will die and not go to the south,” he said, adding that he was trying to protect 20 other relatives from Israel’s bombardment. “We are resisting and will not leave the north, even if I die here.”
     
            The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has displaced 1.9 million people, according to the UN. On Sunday, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees warned that the enclave “has become a place unfit for humans,” citing destruction, hunger and disease.
     
            “They have humiliated us and lied to us… My entire family lives in the south in a tent, and they are not safe at all,” Mohammad Ibrahim, a father-of-two in Jabalya, told CNN over the phone.
     
            The history teacher said he would rather stay with his two sons at their home, preferring to die “with dignity.”
     
        “There are many like me who will stay in Jabalya. We have no friends, relatives, or real safe shelter, and since death is the same, we will remain.”
     
 
Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.
 
            Israeli airstrikes early Sunday morning targeted a school and mosque that were converted into shelters in central Gaza, overwhelming nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital with casualties.
     
            The hospital received 53 injured patients and 22 bodies of those killed in the attack on the shelters in Deir Al-Balah, according to a statement from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders.
     
        “Many patients arrived in critical condition, suffering from head, chest and abdominal injuries,” said Eliza Sabatini, an MSF nurse in Gaza. “The situation in the hospital was chaotic. There weren’t enough beds for all the patients, and we had to treat people on the floor.”
     
 
            Al-Aqsa hospital is one of the few remaining operational health care facilities in Gaza, the MSF statement noted. The aid group urged officials to reach a ceasefire to alleviate the ongoing suffering in Gaza, where it says 80% of the more than 27,600 patients MSF has treated during the conflict suffered from wounds linked to shelling.
     
More on the strikes: Earlier Sunday, hospital officials confirmed to CNN that at least 25 people were killed after Israeli airstrikes targeted the mosque and school.
     
            CNN footage from Al-Aqsa hospital captured the grief of a mother crouched over her deceased son, crying and wailing, “My love, my son. My love, my son.”
     
            The Israeli military has stated it was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center that was “embedded within the compound” it struck Sunday, and said it had taken steps to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians.”
     
            Ali Ghosn made a dangerous trip Sunday. He headed to the southern Lebanese city of Tyre to deliver food, despite the Israeli military warning people not to drive in that direction.
     
        “Most of the time, I’m the only vehicle on the road from Sidon to Tyre. Rarely does a car pass by, except for an ambulance. I never stop, I don’t hit the brakes unless it’s absolutely necessary. You have to maintain your speed, regardless of the bombardment and sonic booms,” he told CNN over the phone from Tyre, which he says has become a ghost town.
     
 
            “All the markets, cafes and shops are closed. Even the clinics and pharmacies are closed, and if you want a loaf of bread you have to drive north to Sidon,” he said, referring to the coastal city halfway between Beirut and Tyre.
     
            Troubled by this situation, he now helps the remaining Tyre residents get much-needed supplies and assists others with urgent errands. Some residents entrust him with their keys, so he can go fetch belongings from their deserted homes.
     
            Over 1 million people have been displaced in recent weeks due to Israel’s intense bombardment of villages in southern Lebanon and southern Beirut. Schools in main cities have been turned into shelters, but many people remain camped out in the streets unable to find housing.
     
            Ghosn took his family out of the border area when the increased hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel began last year. His family’s displacement makes him understand what others are going through now, he explained. He doesn’t always ask to be paid for his services:
     
        “I need money to pay for the fuel for the drive back and forth, but when it comes to humanitarian purposes like delivering medicine or bread, I can’t possibly ask for money.”
     
 
            Israel is closely coordinating with the United States as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but will make its own, independent decisions about how to retaliate, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told CNN.
     
            Even as the US has made clear it opposes a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Gallant said Israel has not ruled out any of its options.
     
        “Everything is on the table,” said Gallant, who will meet with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday to coordinate on threats from Iran and its proxies.
     
 
            “Israel has capabilities to hit targets near and far — we have proved it. We will respond to the Iranian attack appropriately. We will not stand by and neither should the international community,” Gallant said.
     
            Gallant has become one of Israel’s key interlocutors with the US, speaking frequently with Austin and top White House officials. He also met Sunday with Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the head of US Central Command, to discuss Israel’s planned retaliation against Iran.
     
            Gallant also touted the success of Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah so far, saying Israel has “dismantled a major part of their capabilities” and that Hezbollah now faces “a lack of command and control.”
     
            The defense minister said the ground operation remains limited to targeting Hezbollah positions closer to the border, even as the operation has expanded in recent days.
     
            Gallant argued that the blows Israel has dealt against Hezbollah “have made a crack that now opens the door to change not just in Lebanon, but in the entire Middle East.”
     
            There have been more demonstrations, marches and memorials across the world ahead of the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel.
     
            Large crowds marched through the streets of Barcelona, Jakarta, Sydney and other cities on Sunday marking a year since the attacks, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel, according to officials in the country. Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry there, and created a dire humanitarian crisis.
     
            Miguel Verdugo, a 72-year-old protester in Barcelona, told Reuters: “We must express that we are against genocide. The least we should all do is protest in every capital city around the world.”
     
        “Violence doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The occupation, the apartheid that has been going on in Israel of the Palestinian people, the siege of Gaza, the absolute illegal settlement, the brutality in the West Bank, it has to stop,” protester Sam Gazal told Reuters in Sydney.
     
 
            Meanwhile, there were tributes and memorials for the victims of the Hamas attacks in cities across the world.
     
            Events were held in Berlin, Paris, London and Israel on Sunday, while the Pope led a prayer for peace at the Basilica of Saint Mary Major.
     
            In Berlin, hundreds of people rallied under the slogan, “United against the crimes of Hamas against Israelis and Palestinians,” Reuters reported.
     
        Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal spoke at the Berlin event, saying of the October 7 victims, “We will never forget them. We stand together with them and we pray to God that the hostages will come home now,” according to Reuters.
     
 
            In Tel Aviv, people held a vigil at Hostages Square. And there will be a memorial Sunday night at the Nova music festival site, with families of the victims attending.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Sunday evening, following Macron’s call for an arms embargo against Israel.
     
            Netanyahu said Israel expected its friends to support it against the “Iranian terror axis” rather than impose restrictions. According to his office, the prime minister also made the case that Israel’s offensives against Iran-backed militant groups would benefit the whole region.
     
            According to a statement from the French presidential office, Macron reiterated his support for Israeli’s security and expressed solidarity for the people of Israel, especially the victims of the October 7 attacks, the hostages and their families. He also expressed the importance of a ceasefire deal.
     
            The leaders agreed that their countries would revisit the discussion when French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot meets with Israeli officials on Monday, when he will visit Israel and the West Bank.
     
More background: On Saturday, Macron had called for the complete suspension of the sale of arms “used in the war in Gaza,” while stressing France has not been involved in their supply.
     
            Netanyahu responded by saying “shame on” Macron and other countries who call for arms embargoes against Israel, adding, “Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together.”
     
            Several countries including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom have been criticized by human rights groups for failing to suspend arms sales to Israel as its bombardment of Gaza has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead.
     
            The Israeli military said it is preparing for the possibility of terror attacks by Hamas to mark the anniversary of the October 7, 2023, attacks.
     
            Israel Defense Forces international spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters that Israel would be enforcing extra security measures across the country Monday.
     
            “We know (Hamas) have a tendency to try and carry out terror attacks on these kind of symbolic dates … and that’s why we’re preparing for that, adding forces in the south and preparing for that kind of thing,” he said.
     
            Shoshani added that Hamas had fired rockets from Gaza into southern Israel on Sunday, a day before the anniversary.
     
            Asked by CNN about Hamas’ abilities to continue firing these rockets into the south and Tel Aviv, Shoshani said the number of rockets fired had “dropped dramatically.”
     
            “Hamas had dozens of thousands of rockets. Hezbollah has had somewhere in the vicinity of 150,000 rockets. So even though we have great progress, there’s still a way to go. We’ve seen the numbers drop drastically. The amount of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel has dropped dramatically,” he said.
     
New operation in Gaza: Israel’s military says it has encircled Jabalya in northern Gaza and launched a new ground operation after seeing signs of Hamas rebuilding there, despite nearly a year of fighting and devastating strikes in the territory.
     
            Shoshani said Israel is opening two evacuation routes for people fleeing the new operation.
     
            Flights at Iran’s airports will be canceled overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization.
     
            The agency, citing “operational restrictions that have arisen” said the closure will last from 9 p.m. local time Sunday (1:30 p.m. ET) until 6 a.m. local time Monday morning, according to Iran’s semi-official Mehr news agency.
     
            Iran will also shut down part of its western airspace nightly until at least October 9, citing “military exercises,” according to a notice to airmen issued by the aviation authority.
     
            The four “airways” that transit Iran’s western airspace will be shut from 8:30 p.m. to 4 a.m. local time.
     
Some context: No further details about the decision to cancel flights and shut down airspace were provided, but the moves coincide with the one-year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.
     
            Israeli officials have also vowed to retaliate after Iran launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel last Tuesday, marking its largest-ever attack on its regional adversary. Israel has not said when or what form this retaliation may take.
     
CNN’s Paul P. Murphy contributed reporting to this post.

            The Israeli military has called for the evacuation of residents from an additional 19 villages in southern Lebanon, located within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of the border with Israel.
     
            The military told residents to move about 50 kilometers (31 miles) further into the country.
     
            “You must immediately move to the north of the Awali River. Save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately,” Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Forces’ Arabic spokesperson, said on X on Sunday.
     
            This announcement follows a series of Israeli evacuation warnings over the past week, which now affect a total of 124 villages.
     
            The Awali River is north of the city of Sidon, and just south of Beirut. The total land mass south of the river to the Israeli border represents a quarter of Lebanese territory.
     
            The IDF spokesperson also reiterated previous advice for residents to avoid traveling “using vehicles” further into southern Lebanon from north of the Litani River, which lies roughly 18 miles from the border.
     
Some background: In the past two weeks, evacuation warnings from Israel’s military have immediately preceded airstrikes in southern Lebanon — sometimes by a few minutes.
     
            Israel is carrying out an unprecedented bombing campaign on the country as part of its war against Hezbollah. The bombardment has at times targeted densely populated areas, where Israel says the militant group has intentionally embedded itself in the civilian population, destroying homes and forcing residents to flee.
     
            More than 1,400 people have been killed and over 1 million displaced by the Israeli campaign, according to the Lebanese government.
     
            An Israeli strike landed close to Roman ruins in the Lebanese city of Baalbek, raising warnings from local officials on the structural integrity of the site.
     
            The Israeli attack did not target the historic complex, Baalbek-Hermel Governor Bachir Khodr said — but it struck nearby.
     
            “It is 500 to 700 meters away from it, but raids near it will have negative repercussions on it,” Khodr said in a post on X Sunday.
     
            Khodr shared an image showing smoke rising behind what appears to be the monoliths of the ancient complex. It is unclear what the Israeli military was targeting in the area. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces.
     
More on the historic significance of site: The ancient complex — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — contains the ruins of some of the largest and best-preserved Roman temples. It has survived many natural disasters and conflicts over centuries, most recently the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah conflict and a 15-year civil war that started in 1975.
     
            The city of Baalbek has a Hezbollah presence and is located northeast of Lebanon. It has been targeted by Israel several times over the past year.
     
            The Israeli military has been carrying out its current bombing campaign in Lebanon at an unprecedented intensity. The Lebanese government says strikes have killed more than 1,400 people and forced hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee residential areas, where the IDF says the militant group is operating.
     
            A police officer has been killed and 10 people have been injured in a shooting attack at a bus station in the southern Israeli city of Be’er Sheva on Sunday, according to emergency services.
     
            The officer killed has been identified by Israeli law enforcement as Shira Suslik. Suslik was an officer in Israel’s Southern Border Police, a police spokesperson said, announcing her death “with great sadness and grief.”
     
            The spokesperson said that Suslik “fell in an encounter with a terrorist in the attack.”
     
            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services said the people injured in the attack were taken to Soroka Medical Center, including one person who is in moderate-to-serious condition with gunshot wounds.
     
            Four others are in moderate condition with gunshot wounds, and five are in mild condition with bruises and injuries from glass shards, MDA said.
     
            The attacker was killed, an Israeli police spokesperson said.
     
            “The terrorist has been neutralized, and numerous police forces from the southern district are present at the scene,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
     
This post has been updated with details about the officer killed in the shooting.
 
            The Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tzipi Hotovely, has denied Lebanon’s assertion that the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah accepted a ceasefire deal before his assassination.
     
        “Hassan Nasrallah didn’t agree to any ceasefire, it’s just ridiculous,” Tzipi said, speaking on the UK’s Sky News on Sunday, adding that the claim has “no base in reality.”
     
 
            “Let’s not speak about the good intentions of a terror organization. They have zero good intentions,” she said.
     
            Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib previously told CNN that Nasrallah had agreed to a US-backed 21-day ceasefire just days before he was assassinated by Israel, something reiterated by Rami Mortada, Lebanon’s ambassador to the UK.
     
            “We expressed our agreement to this scheme that was laid out by the US, UK and 15 other nations. Unfortunately … when (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu reached New York, he just rebuffed all this peace plan and he’s still doing that,” Mortada told Sky News on Sunday, referring to Netanyahu’s combative speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.
     
            Mortada said the ceasefire plan is “a text that is still binding” to Lebanon. He added that it is “a statement of fact that is known to everyone” that prospects for a ceasefire were derailed by the assassination of Nasrallah.
     
            “We are dealing with a war-mongering Israeli government,” Mortada said.
     
            The Israeli military has reinforced soldiers near the Gaza Strip ahead of the ceremonial events that will mark one year since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks into southern Israel.
     
            Additional troops have been deployed at border communities for both “defensive and offensive scenarios,” according to a statement by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            “The soldiers are fully equipped to defend the region in coordination with local security forces, the Israel Police, and Magen David Adom, ensuring a comprehensive response to any incidents that may arise,” the IDF said on Sunday.
     
            One year on, Israeli residents from Kibbutz Be’eri – one of more than a dozen border communities raided by Hamas – told CNN they are scarred by the horrors of October 7 last year, when 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.
     
Multiple fronts of war: Israel has since intensified its war in different arenas in the Middle East, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Saturday that his country is “defending itself” on seven fronts – including against Hamas in Gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            But as scenes of carnage, blasted buildings and mass displacement emerge from Gaza and Lebanon, analysts and human rights workers have issued dire warnings over the human toll in an increasingly fragile region.
     
            Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,870 Palestinians and injured another 97,166 people, according to the ministry of health there. The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian deaths.
     
            In Lebanon, more than 1,400 people have been killed by Israeli strikes, and nearly 7,500 injured, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
CNN’s Matthew Chance, Yon Pomrenze and Sana Noor Haq contributed reporting.
 
            Lebanon has postponed the start of the school year until November 2 as a protective measure amid the escalating fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Some 400,000 students and 40,000 teachers have been displaced from their homes across the country following the fighting, Lebanese education minister Abbas Halabi said on Sunday.
     
            The majority of private schools have requested a postponement of the school year due to the “(Israeli) hostility, the displacement and the mental state of the students,” he said.
     
            The minister said the “situation is complex” and the authorities needed time to apply a plan for a virtual school year.
     
            “In-person attendance has security dangers and mental obstacles stopping families from accepting that their children will be traveling on roads to go to their classes,” Halabi said.
     
            Lebanese authorities say over 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month. Many have been housed temporarily in schools across the country, or camped out on sidewalks, in parks, churches and mosques.
     
            “We hope new centers will be found to receive the displaced instead of schools,” Halabi said.
     
            Universities could decide whether students are allowed to return back to the educational facilities starting Monday, Halabi said.
     
            The Israeli military has continued to bombard Lebanon’s capital, in what it said was a “series of targeted strikes” on weapons storage facilities and other parts of Hezbollah’s infrastructure. Israeli strikes across the country on Saturday killed 23 people and injured 93, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            Elsewhere, Israel has said that it has “encircled” the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, after detecting the presence of Hamas members in the area. Strikes on a mosque in central Gaza have killed at least 25, hospital officials said.
     
            Meanwhile, as the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel nears, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his country “is defending itself on seven fronts.”
     
Here’s what you need to know:
 
            • Strikes on Beirut: Israel pounded the city with heavy airstrikes overnight. CNN’s Jomana Karadsheh is on the ground in the capital and said that Saturday night’s strikes were among the most sustained and intense she has seen since the war between Israel and Hezbollah began. The number of casualties from the strikes is not yet known.
     
            • Gaza refugee camp surrounded: The Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza has been “encircled,” the Israeli military said, after it launched both air and ground operations targeting what it says was military infrastructure. At least two people were killed and several others taken to hospital after an apartment in the camp was struck, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said.
     
            • Strike on Gaza mosque: At least 25 people have been killed in an overnight Israeli strike on the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in central Gaza, according to hospital officials. A journalist working for CNN said that displaced Palestinians were sheltering at the mosque when it was struck. The Israeli military said the strike was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center. Footage from the scene shows people working in the dark to find victims in the rubble, using the light from their phones to see. A further four people were killed in a strike on a nearby school, the hospital officials said.
     
            • War on multiple fronts: Netanyahu has said that Israel is fighting “against the enemies of civilization” on seven fronts, including Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, and Iran itself. “Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won – for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world,” he said.
     
            • Global protests: Thousands of people around the world took to the streets Saturday in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Demonstrations took place in London, Dublin, Paris, Manila, Cape Town, Rome and other major cities, calling for an end to the war. Meanwhile, in Israel, protesters across the country are demanding more urgent action to rescue the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.
     
            • Key Hezbollah leader missing: Hezbollah has lost contact with a possible successor to its late leader Hassan Nasrallah, a Lebanese security source told CNN Saturday. Hashem Safieddine was targeted in an Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday.
     
            At least 25 people are confirmed dead after Israeli airstrikes hit a mosque and a school in central Gaza, hospital officials say.
     
            Rawiya Musabbeh, the mother of a 26-year-old man who was killed in the strikes, said that he had been sheltering in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in Deir el Balah when it was hit.
     
            “My son was injured in the north and came to the south for medical treatment. He had no other place to sleep, so he had been sleeping in the mosque for the last nine months,” Musabbeh said on CNN video from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which lies across the street from the mosque.
     
            Nabil Nadda, who was near the mosque when it was struck, said that he heard a “big boom that shook us all, both children and adults,” during the night.
     
            “The mosque was a shelter for displaced people, there are no militants or anything inside,” he said. “Just people who have no shelter, tents, or homes, so they sheltered in the mosque.”
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, calling it “precise.” It said it was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center that was “embedded within the compound.”
     
            Lebanon is coming to terms with new devastation inflicted on southern Beirut by heavy overnight Israeli strikes.
     
            CNN’s international correspondent Jomana Karadsheh, who was on the ground in Beirut at the time, described Saturday night’s attacks as among the most sustained and intense she has witnessed on the city’s southern suburbs since this war began.
     
            Clouds of smoke could be seen billowing above the Lebanese capital on Sunday morning, as Israel continues its offensive against Hezbollah.
     
            Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Saturday killed 23 people and injured 93, the Lebanese health ministry has said.
     
            People were killed in strikes that targeted cities and villages in southern and northern Lebanon, including in Nabatieh, Bekaa, Baalbek and Mount Lebanon, the ministry said.
     
            It’s unclear if the death toll includes strikes on Beirut on Saturday night, in which buildings were heavily damaged. At least two of the blasts triggered what appeared to be secondary explosions, according to the CNN team on the ground. One of the blasts hit the road to the airport.
     
            On Sunday morning, a large plume of smoke rose into the Lebanese capital’s skyline after a strike targeted the city’s suburbs. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it would not comment on what it was targeting in the area.
     
            Dozens of families in northern Gaza have packed up their belongings and fled once again after a warning from the Israeli military of a fresh ground operation against Hamas in the Jabalya area.
     
            “People left their homes this morning, and they don’t know where to go, carrying some simple belongings. There are no means of transportation,” Abu Alaa Asaf, a resident of Beit Lahiya, said.
     
            The Israeli military called on Palestinian residents to evacuate areas in the north, which is home to Gaza’s biggest refugee camp, before announcing that two brigades of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) encircled Jabalya to stop Hamas from rebuilding its operational capabilities.
     
            Before this, airstrikes were carried out, hitting “dozens of military targets,” the Israeli military said. Hamas’s military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said Saturday it was engaged in “fierce fights” with Israeli forces in northern Gaza.
     
            “We heard the sounds of explosions all night long as if the war started today,” Asaf said.
     
            Ismail Zaida, a resident of the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in the north, saw “hundreds” of people fleeing towards Gaza City, also in northern Gaza.
     
            Some northern residents are refusing to move to Al-Mawasi, an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in the south. Last month, Israel struck the area, killing at least 19 people, according to Gaza health authorities.
     
            “People would rather die at home than get humiliated here and there,” Zaida said.
     
            “Where do we go? From one death to another? Death is everywhere whether in the south or north,” Zaida said.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that nearly one year after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, his country is now fighting on seven fronts.
     
            “Today, Israel is defending itself on seven fronts against the enemies of civilization,” he said in a video statement Saturday. He said those include Iranian-backed Hezbollah in the north, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, “terrorists” in the West Bank and the Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria.
     
        “And we are fighting against Iran, which last week fired over 200 ballistic missiles directly at Israel and which stands behind this seven-front war against Israel,” Netanyahu said.
     
 
            He said he is maintaining his promise to change the balance of power in the north between Israel and Lebanon. Israel has launched nearly 9,000 attacks into Lebanon since October 8 and Hezbollah launched 1,500 attacks in that same time frame, according to the ACLED data.
 
            Referring to Gaza, Netanyahu said that Israel has a right defend itself and that it will not forget the 101 hostages “whom we are committed to with all our might to bring them home.” At least 41,825 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7 last year, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
     
            Netanyahu said “shame on” French President Emmanuel Macron and other countries who call for arms embargoes against Israel. “Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won – for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world,” Netanyahu added.
     
            More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in the last month, and nearly 7,500 injured, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            We were preparing to go live on air when the first airstrike hit the southern suburbs of Beirut shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday – kicking off a night of intense and constant Israeli strikes.
     
            About 30 minutes earlier, I had been sat with a young woman who lives in the southern suburbs, when our phones flashed with a post on X. It was from the Arabic-language spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, issuing new evacuation orders for several neighborhoods ahead of what he said would be strikes on Hezbollah targets.
     
            The woman gasped. Her family’s home was within one of the evacuation zones. Like many residents of one of the most densely populated parts of the country, she had fled her home as Israeli strikes intensified in recent days, leaving with very little.
     
            Hours earlier she had wanted to go back home to grab some warm clothes, as winter is approaching. But even during the day a return to the suburbs would have been dangerous, so she decided to take the advice of colleagues and not return home. And as feared, there were multiple strikes with no prior warning.
     
            Saturday night’s strikes were among the most sustained and intense I have witnessed hitting the southern suburbs since this war began. First we heard rumbling sounds, followed by flashes in the distance. Then we heard the blasts. At least two of the strikes triggered what appeared to be secondary explosions – balls of fire that at times would light the night sky, accompanied by blasts that echoed across the city.
     
            Amid the explosions came another evacuation order and another IDF post on X saying it is “currently targeting Hezbollah terrorist targets in the Beirut area.”
     
            Many people I have spoken to over the past 10 days do not believe statements about “targeted” and “precise” strikes. They fear this war is going to be as destructive as the war in Gaza, that reduced much of the enclave to rubble and killed more than 41,000 people.
     
            As I am writing this at 3:30 a.m., I hear another big blast rattle the windows of my hotel room. I can still hear the constant buzz of Israeli drones over the city – usually an indication of more strikes to come – and I can’t help but think of the people of Beirut who have been through so much for so long.
     
            How many casualties are there? Did people evacuate in time? How are parents comforting their children during this long and terrifying night?
     
            Is that young woman’s house still standing?
     
            The Israeli military says it has “encircled” Jabalya in northern Gaza and is “continuing to operate in the area.”
     
            Ahead of the ground operation in the refugee camp, airstrikes were carried out overnight, the military confirmed, including against what it says are “weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure sites, terrorist cells, and additional military infrastructure sites.”
     
            A journalist in the area told CNN the strikes lasted about 90 minutes and were concentrated on eastern Jabalya and nearby Gaza City.
     
            Paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent Society said two people had been killed and several others taken to hospital after an apartment in a building near the UNRWA clinic in Jabalya refugee camp was struck. UNRWA is a relief organization working in the Palestinian territories.
     
            In a statement, the military said it had detected the presence of Hamas members in the area, as well as efforts by them “to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area,” and was moving forward with the operation to “dismantle” that infrastructure in the area, saying it will “continue as long as required in order to achieve its objectives.”
     
            In May, CNN reported that the Israeli military had renewed its fighting in northern Gaza where it had claimed, in January, to have dismantled Hamas’ command structure. During that period, the Israeli military said Hamas was trying to “reassemble” in the area, raising doubts about whether Israel’s goal of eradicating the group in the enclave is realistic.
     
            Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military warned residents in northern Gaza to evacuate.
     
            The Arabic-speaking spokesperson for the Israeli military Avichay Adraee said the military is “publishing a new evacuation map for the northern Gaza Strip.”
     
            Adraee also said the military has expanded the scope of the “humanitarian area” in Al-Mawasi, including the routes to get there. The area indicates places the Israeli military says civilians can safely travel.
     
            “The expanded Humanitarian Area includes field hospitals that have been established since the outbreak of the war, tent compounds, and supplies of food, water, medicine, and medical equipment,” the military said.
     
            A journalist in Gaza told CNN Palestinians have been evacuating the area since late Saturday and moving toward Gaza City.
     
            As the world awaits Israel’s response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack, Israel is not going to take advice from US President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump, said Steven Cook, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
     
            Biden has said Israel should not target Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities, while Trump – currently running to succeed Biden in the presidential election – has suggested Israel should do so.
     
            “The Israelis are not going to be limited by what the president and former president have to say,” Cook told CNN’s Michael Holmes.
     
            “They are going to target those facilities and weaponry in Iran that are the most dangerous to Israel.”
     
            “The real question is how far up the escalation ladder will the Israelis go, and whether the Iranians feel compelled to then respond,” Cook added.
     
            Israel’s goal will be to intimidate Iran, which has already pledged to retaliate if Israel attacks.
     
            “There you see the direction that this conflict could go,” Cook said.
     
            There are risks of going too far, he said, adding that as long as the war continues, Israel risks radicalizing communities in Lebanon, which it has already done in Gaza.
     
            Hezbollah, the militant group Israel is fighting, was born out of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
     
            However, Israel has shown in past weeks it is willing to take considerable risks, Cook said.
     
            “This is a very dangerous moment in the Middle East.”
     
            Days into Israel’s bombing campaign, most people in Lebanon are “stuck in the freeze traumatic response,” unable to grasp the scale of the destruction, said Arwa Damon, president of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance.
     
            Many in the country have watched over the past year as Gaza has been reduced to rubble and are wondering whether Lebanon will face a similar fate, Damon told CNN’s Michael Holmes.
     
            “I can’t even begin to describe to you, Michael, the depth and breadth of the fear that exists here, because everyone has been watching what’s been happening in Gaza,” said Damon, a former CNN journalist whose organization helps children in disaster zones.
     
            Humanitarian workers have had to rush to respond to an unprecedented crisis all while living through it themselves, she added.
     
            Many have lost loved ones or been forced to flee their homes, along with roughly one fifth of Lebanon’s population, Damon said.
     
            “The psychological toll of all of this is just devastating, never mind the physical one.”
     
            The Israeli military has confirmed it “conducted a series of targeted strikes” in the area of Lebanon’s capital Beirut overnight, saying it targeted “weapons storage facilities” and other parts of Hezbollah’s infrastructure.
     
            The Arabic-language spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces issued new evacuation orders for several neighborhoods ahead of what he said would be strikes on targets belonging to the Iran-backed militant group.
     
            Earlier, CNN’s team on the ground in Beirut said they heard constant blasts and explosions for a few hours.
     
            CNN’s Jomana Karadsheh said Saturday night’s strikes were among the most sustained and intense she has witnessed hitting the southern suburbs since the war began. First the team heard rumbling sounds, followed by flashes in the distance, then they heard the blasts. At least two of the strikes triggered what appeared to be secondary explosions – balls of fire that at times would light the night sky, accompanied by blasts that echoed across the city.
     
            The number of casualties is not yet clear.
     
            Last week Israel launched a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon as it ratchets up its war with the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.
     
            For the first time since 2006, Israel struck central Beirut, with previous attacks being confined to the city’s southern suburbs. Israel is now pounding Lebanon with a level of bombardment not seen outside of Gaza in the last 20 years, according to air warfare experts.
     
            It all amounts to a dramatic escalation in the Middle East, and suggests fears of an expanded regional war have been realized.
     
            Those fears have only been deepened by Iran’s largest-ever missile attack on Israel — which also came last week. The region is bracing for Israel’s response, and Tehran has already pledged it will attack Israel again if it deems that necessary.
     
Here’s a timeline of last week’s key events:
 
            The death toll from an Israeli strike on a mosque in central Gaza has risen to 21, according to the local Civil Defense and a nearby hospital.
     
            CNN video showed chaotic scenes as bodies were pulled from rubble after the overnight attack on the religious site in Deir el Balah.
     
            The revised death toll – up from 18 – came from Civil Defense and Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is right across from the mosque.
     
            Civilians, civil defense, and hospital staff were all working in the dark to retrieve victims from the rubble of the mosque, using only the light from their phones, the CNN video showed.
     
            In the footage, bodies are seen scattered everywhere and people shout for attention with each casualty they find.
     
            “He’s alive, by God he’s alive,” a man yells as he tries to revive another victim, who lies motionless on the ground.
     
            A group of men pull out a man, still alive, who had been trapped under a block. Another seems to have been killed in the attack.
     
            The injured, carried on blankets, are rushed to the nearby hospital, some covered in blood and dust.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, calling it “precise” and saying it was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center that was “embedded within the compound.”
     
This post has been updated. 
 
            At least 18 people have been killed in an overnight Israeli strike on Al Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in Deir el Balah in central Gaza, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The hospital sits right across from the mosque.
     
            A CNN stringer said displaced Palestinians were sheltering there.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, calling it “precise” and saying it was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center that was “embedded within the compound.”
     
        “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,” the military said.
     
 
            CNN’s team on the ground in Beirut say they have heard constant blasts and explosions over the past two to three hours and they appear to be ongoing.
     
            It’s unclear exactly how many blasts there have been, but a member of the team described the explosions in Beirut’s southern suburbs as one of the most intense sustained periods of strikes they had seen.
     
            At least two of the blasts triggered what appeared to be secondary explosions, according to the team. One of the blasts hit the road to the airport, about 2.5km from the facility.
     
            Approximately 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory early on Sunday morning local time, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            Some of the projectiles were intercepted and some fell, the IDF said in a statement.
     
            Thirty minutes after midnight, sirens sounded in Israel’s Kiryat Shmona area in the north.
     
            Hezbollah issued two statements early Sunday saying it had targeted Israeli soldiers in the “Al-Manara settlement” and its surroundings in northern Israel with rockets in support of the Palestinian people and in defense of Lebanon.
     
            In a third statement, Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli forces in the same area as they “evacuated the injured and killed soldiers.”
     
            CNN asked followers on social media if they had questions about the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.
     
            From your responses, we picked some of the most-asked topics and put the key questions to CNN’s Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson.

            • Hezbollah has lost contact with Hashem Safieddine, a possible successor to its late leader Hassan Nasrallah, according to a Lebanese security source. An Israeli strike targeted Safieddine on Friday.
     
            • Israel carried out fresh airstrikes Saturday on the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has seen daily attacks as part of an extensive Israeli bombing campaign. More than 1,400 people have died and over 1 million have been displaced in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            • Hezbollah reported new clashes with Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, where Israel is mounting a ground offensive. In northern Lebanon, a leader of Hamas’ military wing in the country was killed in a rare Israeli airstrike near Tripoli.
     
            • Israel has not given the US assurances it won’t target Iranian nuclear sites, a top State Department official told CNN, as the region braces for Israel’s response to this week’s Iranian missile barrage.
     
            Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
     
            The death toll from an Israeli strike on a mosque in central Gaza has risen to 21, according to the local Civil Defense and a nearby hospital.
     
            CNN video showed chaotic scenes as bodies were pulled from rubble after the overnight attack on the religious site in Deir el Balah.
     
            The revised death toll – up from 18 – came from Civil Defense and Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is right across from the mosque.
     
            Civilians, civil defense, and hospital staff were all working in the dark to retrieve victims from the rubble of the mosque, using only the light from their phones, the CNN video showed.
     
            In the footage, bodies are seen scattered everywhere and people shout for attention with each casualty they find.
     
            “He’s alive, by God he’s alive,” a man yells as he tries to revive another victim, who lies motionless on the ground.
     
            A group of men pull out a man, still alive, who had been trapped under a block. Another seems to have been killed in the attack.
     
            The injured, carried on blankets, are rushed to the nearby hospital, some covered in blood and dust.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, calling it “precise” and saying it was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center that was “embedded within the compound.”
     
            We were preparing to go live on air when the first airstrike hit the southern suburbs of Beirut shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday – kicking off a night of intense and constant Israeli strikes.
     
            About 30 minutes earlier, I had been sat with a young woman who lives in the southern suburbs, when our phones flashed with a post on X. It was from the Arabic-language spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, issuing new evacuation orders for several neighborhoods ahead of what he said would be strikes on Hezbollah targets.
     
            The woman gasped. Her family’s home was within one of the evacuation zones. Like many residents of one of the most densely populated parts of the country, she had fled her home as Israeli strikes intensified in recent days, leaving with very little.
     
            Hours earlier she had wanted to go back home to grab some warm clothes, as winter is approaching. But even during the day a return to the suburbs would have been dangerous, so she decided to take the advice of colleagues and not return home. And as feared, there were multiple strikes with no prior warning.
     
            Saturday night’s strikes were among the most sustained and intense I have witnessed hitting the southern suburbs since this war began. First we heard rumbling sounds, followed by flashes in the distance. Then we heard the blasts. At least two of the strikes triggered what appeared to be secondary explosions – balls of fire that at times would light the night sky, accompanied by blasts that echoed across the city.
     
            Amid the explosions came another evacuation order and another IDF post on X saying it is “currently targeting Hezbollah terrorist targets in the Beirut area.”
     
            Many people I have spoken to over the past 10 days do not believe statements about “targeted” and “precise” strikes. They fear this war is going to be as destructive as the war in Gaza, that reduced much of the enclave to rubble and killed more than 41,000 people.
     
            As I am writing this at 3:30 a.m., I hear another big blast rattle the windows of my hotel room. I can still hear the constant buzz of Israeli drones over the city – usually an indication of more strikes to come – and I can’t help but think of the people of Beirut who have been through so much for so long.
     
            How many casualties are there? Did people evacuate in time? How are parents comforting their children during this long and terrifying night?
     
            Is that young woman’s house still standing?
     
            At least 18 people have been killed in an overnight Israeli strike on Al Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in Deir el Balah in central Gaza, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The hospital sits right across from the mosque.
     
            A CNN stringer said displaced Palestinians were sheltering there.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, calling it “precise” and saying it was targeting a Hamas “command and control” center that was “embedded within the compound.”
     
            “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,” the military said.
     
            CNN’s team on the ground in Beirut say they have heard constant blasts and explosions over the past two to three hours and they appear to be ongoing.
     
            It’s unclear exactly how many blasts there have been, but a member of the team described the explosions in Beirut’s southern suburbs as one of the most intense sustained periods of strikes they had seen.
     
            At least two of the blasts triggered what appeared to be secondary explosions, according to the team. One of the blasts hit the road to the airport, about 2.5km from the facility.
     
            Approximately 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory early on Sunday morning local time, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            Some of the projectiles were intercepted and some fell, the IDF said in a statement.
     
            Thirty minutes after midnight, sirens sounded in Israel’s Kiryat Shmona area in the north.
     
            Hezbollah issued two statements early Sunday saying it had targeted Israeli soldiers in the “Al-Manara settlement” and its surroundings in northern Israel with rockets in support of the Palestinian people and in defense of Lebanon.
     
            In a third statement, Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli forces in the same area as they “evacuated the injured and killed soldiers.”
     
            At least five Israeli strikes hit southern Beirut late Saturday night into Sunday, Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported.
     
            Four of the strikes hit Beirut’s southern neighborhood of Dahiyeh, while a fifth hit Choueifat Al-Amrousieh.  Watch CNN’s report from the scene.
     
            A CNN team on the ground saw a series of blasts in southern Beirut that created thick plumes of smoke.
     
            The strikes come shortly after the Israeli military warned residents of some parts of southern Beirut to evacuate immediately.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Qatari, Saudi and French foreign ministers on Saturday to discuss the evolving situations in the Middle East, according to readouts.
     
            During his phone call with French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Noël Barrot, Blinken discussed the diplomatic resolution that would allow citizens of Israel and Lebanon to return to their homes.
     
            Blinken also condemned Iran’s military attack against Israel on October 1.
     
            Speaking to Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, Blinken discussed the need to return civilians to their homes, as well as the “urgent humanitarian situation” in Lebanon and the recent US announcement of nearly $157 million in assistance.
     
            During his phone call with Qatar’s Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Blinken and Al Thani discussed the importance of implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1701 in Lebanon to allow civilians to return to their homes.
     
            Blinken discussed the ceasefire and hostage release negotiations in Gaza with all three foreign ministers.

            Approximately 130 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory Saturday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            The IDF also said it had struck a Hamas command-and-control center Saturday afternoon in the northern Gaza Strip.
     
            Israel’s Air Force worked with IDF intelligence to locate and destroy the center, which they say was embedded inside a building that previously served as a center for the UN’s agency for refugees (UNRWA).
     
            The IDF said they used “precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information” to avoid civilian casualties.
     
            There has been heavy shelling and air strikes by the Israeli military in parts of northern and central Gaza after nightfall on Saturday.
     
            A CNN stringer in the area said the strikes had continued for about 90 minutes and were concentrated on eastern Jabalya and Gaza city.
     
            Paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent Society said two people had been killed and several others taken to the Kamal Adwan hospital after a residential apartment in a building near the UNRWA clinic in Jabalya refugee camp was struck.
     
            UNRWA is the main UN agency in Gaza but has been unable to operate the vast majority of its facilities for much of the last year.
     
            Three more people were killed and others injured in a strike in Bir al-Najjah, west of Jabalya camp.
     
            Witnesses reported the continuous presence of Israeli military drones in western neighborhoods of Gaza City.
     
            The Israeli military said it had conducted a “precise strike” on Hamas militants “who were operating inside a command-and-control center in the area of Jabalya,” and that the center “was embedded inside a compound that previously served as an UNRWA center.”
     
            A CNN team in Beirut heard the sound of rumbling and distant blasts in the southern part of the capital about 30 minutes after the Israeli military issued more evacuation warnings late Saturday.
     
            Big red flashes and a ball of flames could be seen erupting in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the team reported. There was also the persistent buzzing of drones, as has become common in recent weeks.
     
Latest Israeli warnings: A short time before the explosions rocked southern Beirut, an Israeli military spokesperson issued what he called an “additional warning to the residents of the southern suburbs in Haret Hreik and Choueifat Al-Amrousieh.”
     
            Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Forces’ Arabic spokesperson, had posted the advisory on the social media platform X, along with images of specific blocks.
     
            “You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, and the IDF will work against them in the near future,” Adraee said.
     
            Adraee issued an identical warning to residents of Bourj el Barajneh, a densely populated neighborhood that is home to a Palestinian refugee camp and many poorer migrants.
     
More background: In the past two weeks, such warnings from Israel’s military have immediately preceded airstrikes — sometimes by a few minutes.
     
            Israel is carrying out an unprecedented bombing campaign on Lebanon as part of its war against Hezbollah. The capital’s southern suburbs are a seat of power for the Iran-backed militant group, but also home to crowded residential neighborhoods, where civilians have been killed or forced to flee the aerial assault.
     
            Two days before the anniversary of the Hamas attacks on southern Israel, protesters have taken to the streets in several parts of the country demanding more urgent action to rescue the hostages still held in Gaza.
     
            Protests took place in Tel Aviv, Caesarea, Beersheba, Jerusalem and elsewhere, with the relatives of hostages pleading for a release deal amid growing conflict across the region. The Ayalon highway in Tel Aviv was blocked, according to video footage on social media. The demonstration in Caesarea was held outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence.
     
            The main weekly rallies organized by the Families Forum were called off due to the security situation, with organizers fearing the risk of Hezbollah missiles landing in central Israel.
     
            Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the 101 hostages still held in Gaza, said at a protest at Begin Gate in Tel Aviv: “Why are they still in Gaza? Because of Netanyahu.”
     
        “Netanyahu does not want to bring back the hostages. Even if the war in the north ends, Netanyahu wants the war in the south to continue,” Zangauker said, referencing Israel’s war with Hezbollah across its northern border. He said he believes the wars are benefiting Netanyahu politically and allowing him to stay in power.
     
 
            Dani Elgarat, whose brother Itzik is one of the hostages, also blamed Netanyahu, saying a whole year had passed, “during which the hostages became hostages in Netanyahu’s war of personal survival.”
     
        Yifat Kalderon, whose cousin Ofer is among the hostages, said: “We all remember how a few months ago the defense establishment warned about a window of opportunity for a deal that is closing. And now for weeks the negotiations have been stuck.”
     
 
            At a rally in Carmei Gat, one of the hostages freed in November, Liat Atzili Benin, acknowledged that mourning loved ones at the attacks’ anniversary was complicated by divided opinions on the path forward for the country.
     
        Souls are bruised, anger is high, and a sense of helplessness is paralyzing,” Benin said.
     
 
            “There is one thing our community agrees on without dispute,” she added, saying it was the “uncompromising struggle” to return the remaining hostages.
     
            New Israeli airstrikes have struck Beirut’s southern suburbs on Saturday, the scene of daily attacks over the past week.
     
            Meanwhile, Hezbollah has lost contact with a possible successor to its late leader Hassan Nasrallah, according to a Lebanese security source.
     
            And a leader of Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon was killed in a rare Israeli airstrike near Lebanon’s northernmost city of Tripoli.
     
Here’s what you need to know:
 
            • Fresh airstrikes: Israel has carried out strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs, launching several missiles at an area close to the airport. This residential area, which is a Hezbollah seat of power, is where Israel has focused many of its attacks during its escalating war with the Iran-backed paramilitary group. Lebanon’s government says Israel’s extensive bombing campaign has left more than 1,400 people dead and created a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Hezbollah is returning fire across the border, launching about 130 projectiles into Israeli territory Saturday, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
     
            • Lost touch with key Hezbollah leader: The group has not heard from Hashem Safieddine since an Israeli strike targeted him in Beirut on Friday, the Lebanese security source told CNN Saturday. Safieddine has been seen as one of the most likely heirs to the organization’s highest-ranking seat after Nasrallah’s killing.
     
            • Hamas leader killed in north: Hamas confirmed the death of Atallah Ali, who it described as a leader of the Lebanon branch of its military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades. It is believed that Lebanon’s second-largest city, Tripoli, had not previously been targeted since the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.
     
            • Rallies around the globe: Thousands of people rallied Saturday in support of Palestinians ahead of the one-year anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks and the ensuing war in Gaza. Marches have been taking place in Paris, Manila, Cape Town and other major cities. In Rome, police fired tear gas at an unauthorized pro-Palestinian protest with about 5,000 people after protesters started throwing objects at authorities.
     
            • Ground operations: Israeli forces have so far destroyed more than 2,000 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon — including weapons, military buildings and underground infrastructures — according to the IDF’s spokesperson. Israeli authorities said Saturday they were responding to several reports of direct hits to houses and debris falling in northern Israel after a barrage of rockets was fired by Hezbollah.
     
            • Almost a year of war: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says nearly one year after the October 7 attacks, his country is now fighting on seven fronts. Israel is carrying on with its war against Hamas in Gaza, even as attention has turned to its bombardment of Lebanon. Israeli airstrikes pounded northern and central Gaza after nightfall Saturday, with several people reportedly killed. The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas militants in the enclave, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed, including thousands of children. Hamas, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, and Israel’s dual conflicts with the groups have deepened fears of a wider regional war.
     
            UK Foreign Minister David Lammy has called reports of Israeli strikes on health facilities and support personnel in Lebanon “deeply disturbing” in a post on X on Saturday.
     
            Lammy also called for an “immediate ceasefire on both sides so Israeli and Lebanese civilians can return home.”
     
            On Thursday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 37 health facilities had been forced to close in southern Lebanon and at least 28 health care workers had been killed in the previous 24 hours alone.
     
            On Friday, the Marjayoun Governmental Hospital near the Israel-Lebanon border was evacuated after an Israeli strike hit the area outside its main entrance, killing seven people, the facility’s director, Dr. Mones Kalakish, told CNN. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment.
     
            Also on Friday, the Israeli military carried out a strike in the vicinity of the Martyr Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, after ordering its evacuation, the National News Agency of Lebanon reported. The airstrike hit a mosque adjacent to the hospital. Israel claimed the mosque was used as a Hezbollah command center.
     
            Nine medical staff were injured and the hospital was evacuated, according to state media.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces is on high alert ahead of Monday’s anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Saturday.
     
            “We are prepared with reinforced troops, based on the assumption that toward this date, attempted terror attacks will be carried out against the homefront,” Hagari said Saturday.
     
            Hagari said the IDF is coordinating with security agencies and that the military’s forces are “on very high alert.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says nearly one year after Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, his country is now fighting on seven fronts.
     
            “Today, Israel is defending itself on seven fronts against the enemies of civilization,” he said in a video statement Saturday.
     
            He said those include Iranian-backed Hezbollah in the north, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, “terrorists” in the West Bank, and the Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria.
     
        “And we are fighting against Iran, which last week fired over 200 ballistic missiles directly at Israel and which stands behind this seven-front war against Israel,” Netanayhu said.
     
 
            He said he is maintaining his promise to change the balance of power in the north between Israel and Lebanon, where Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been attacking Israel with rockets, missiles and UAVs since October 8 of last year.
     
            Referring to Gaza, he said that Israel has a right defend itself and that it will not forget the 101 hostages “whom we are committed to with all our might to bring them home.”
     
            He also said “shame on” French President Emmanuel Macron and other countries who call for arms embargoes against Israel.
     
            “Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won — for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world,” Netanyahu added.
     
Remember: The Iran-backed militant groups spread throughout the Middle East have long been at conflict with Israel, but have engaged in intensifying clashes since October 7. Groups like the Houthis and Hezbollah say their attacks are in support of the Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel’s military campaign has killed tens of thousands and led to a humanitarian crisis.
     
            Israeli forces have so far destroyed more than 2,000 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon — including weapons, military buildings and underground infrastructures — according to the spokesperson for Israel’s military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.
     
            Hagari said Hezbollah had “invested many efforts and resources to locate its military means under the ground and inside civilian buildings in villages adjacent to the border. Now, we are fiercely operating to dismantle those.”
     
            He said some Hezbollah operatives had been killed in close-quarters combat, and asserted that some 440 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in ground combat or from the air, including about 30 commanders of various ranks.
     
            Hagari added that Hezbollah’s chain of command had been “severely hit … (and) this is painful to the Iranian leadership.”
     
            Israel’s extensive bombing campaign in Lebanon has at times targeted densely populated areas, leaving more than 1,400 people dead and over 1 million displaced, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
On the Iranian attack: Hagari also confirmed that during Iranian ballistic missile attacks against Israel on Tuesday, there were “several hits in central Israel, in civilian areas,” as well as on air bases in Nevatim and Tel Nof. The strikes had not hit planes and did not harm the air force’s operations, Hagari said.
     
        “The manner in which we will respond to this criminal attack will be in the way, place and time that we will decide upon,” according to direction from the country’s political leadership, he said. 
     
 
In southern Lebanon: The IDF said Saturday that service members in the Paratroopers Brigade “continue to fight in southern Lebanon, navigating complex, mountainous, and dense terrain.”
     
            The IDF also released details of tunnels it said it had uncovered in southern Lebanon. Troops had destroyed “250 meters of underground terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon,” it claimed.
     
            An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering orphans in central Gaza killed at least one child and wounded 15 other Palestinians on Friday, according to health officials.
     
            CNN footage of the aftermath in Deir al-Balah showed blasted pieces of concrete wall. Young boys knelt barefoot and tried to recover torn books, red rucksacks, empty plastic water bottles and canned food. One survivor told CNN she was awoken by the blast, which happened in the middle of the night, as she frantically searched for her son and daughter.
     
            “We were asleep in this room, which is a room for orphans,” said Asma, a mother whose son and daughter were recovered following the attack. “We are still in a state of shock. There was none other than children here.”
     
        I woke up to find my son’s face covered in blood,” Asma said. “The same story with my daughter. I just found her in the rubble.”
     
 
            The Israeli military said in a statement that it “struck terrorists who were operating inside a command-and-control center” at the school. CNN cannot independently verify the statement, but the IDF frequently accuses Hamas of using civilian infrastructure for its operations and has struck well over a dozen schools in various parts of Gaza in the past month.
     
            CNN video shows scores of children injured by the strike lying on the floor at nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
     
Toll on children: Relief workers have repeatedly highlighted the toll of Israel’s military campaign on children in Gaza. The UN children’s agency UNICEF reported on Friday that between 17,000 to 18,000 orphans are unprotected in the besieged strip.
     
            Israeli attacks in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks have killed at least 16,891 children, the Ministry of Health there reported on September 25. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s figures.
     
Remember: Israel is carrying on with its military campaign in Gaza even as attention has turned to its bombardment of Lebanon. Hamas and Hezbollah, the militant groups Israel is fighting on each front, are both backed by Iran, and the dual conflicts have deepened fears of a wider regional war.
     
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog has sent a message to Jewish communities around the world marking the upcoming anniversary of last year’s attack by Hamas on Israel, lamenting the antisemitism around the world that has erupted since.
     
            In his message, Herzog said that “in many senses, we are all still living the aftermath of October 7.”
     
        “It is everywhere in our country. It is also in the antisemitism that came charging forward throughout the world in the wake of the war with Hamas,” he said. 
     
 
            “It is in the ongoing threat to the Jewish state by Iran and its terror proxies, who are blinded by hatred and bent on the destruction of our one and only Jewish nation state,” Herzog added.
     
            But, Herzog continued, “We are a people with the power to keep standing up again and again against hatred.”
     
        “We have not abandoned our deep longing and aspiration for peace with our neighbors. And we hold on to this intention still, even as we insist that we as Jews deserve to feel safe and to be safe — regardless of where on earth we may live …. We will emerge from this difficult time, and we will overcome the hatred, and we will rebuild,” he said.
     
 
            Police used tear gas and water cannons at a pro-Palestinian protest in Rome with about 5,000 people after protesters started throwing objects at authorities.
     
            At least 30 officers and four protesters were injured after the demonstrations turned violent, according to police.
     
            Demonstrators chanted “vergogna,” which means “shameful” in Italian, and shouted the names of US President Joe Biden, Italian Prime Minister Giorgna Meloni and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They carried signs and yelled, “Stop the genocide in Gaza.”
     
            Police tightly guarded the area in Rome’s Ostiense-Testaccio neighborhoods, as the plan for the unauthorized protest was to march from there to the nearby Colosseum, but heavily armored police cars blocked all the exits from a square. Rome police had denied the request to hold the rally, organized by the Young Palestinians group.
     
            Around 5 p.m. local time, protesters who were trying to move the demonstration into a march were met with resistance by police in riot gear. The protesters started throwing bottles and rocks, paper bombs and even some street sign poles that had been dislodged at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons. The protest was eventually dispersed around 6:30 p.m. local time, with five protesters taken into custody, according to a spokesperson for Rome’s municipal police.
     
            Some of the protesters regrouped and carried signs on nearby streets.
     
            Rome police also checked 1,600 people and arrested 19 who were arriving by train at various stations. The arrests were not specified by the police.
     
Here is what protesters had to say at rallies held around the world today:
 
This post has been updated with an injury toll from law enforcement officials.
 
            Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed at least 25 people and injured 127 on Friday, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.
     
            The ministry said the casualties occurred in towns and villages across southern Lebanon, as well as in the city of Nabatieh, the Beqaa valley, the Baalbek-Hermel region, Mount Lebanon and the capital of Beirut.
     
            At least 1,426 people have died and 7,597 people have been injured by Israeli military action in Lebanon since September 16, according to a CNN tally based on the ministry’s data.
     
            Israel has launched an unprecedented bombing campaign and a limited ground offensive in the country as it fights the Iran-backed paramilitary group Hezbollah, which is based out of southern Lebanon.
     
            US President Joe Biden told reporters Saturday that he has not spoken to Israel’s Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu yet, after saying in earlier in the week he would be talking to the Israeli leader.
     
            “No,” the president said, when asked by CNN’s Camila DeChalus if he had spoken to the Israeli leader.
     
            Earlier in the week, the president told reporters that he would be speaking to Netanyahu “relatively soon” amid growing escalation in the Middle East.
     
            The president was also asked about his message to the families of hostages being held in Gaza ahead of the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attack in Israel. Biden, while on the South Lawn, told reporters, “I’ll be talking to a bunch of them.”
     
            Thousands of people rallied around the world Saturday in support for people in Gaza ahead of the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attacks.
     
            Marches have been taking place in Paris, Manila, Cape Town and other major cities in the run-up to the anniversary of the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in the months since, according to the health ministry in the enclave.
     
            “Unfortunately, in spite of all our good will, the Israeli government does not take any notice, and they just go ahead and continue their atrocities in Gaza, now also in Lebanon and in Yemen, and now also probably in Iran,” Agmes Koury, a protester in London, told Reuters while holding a sign reading: “This Holocaust survivor says: Stop the genocide in Gaza.”
     
            Rim Boughanmi, a Tunisian protester who joined Saturday’s march in Rome, told Reuters: “We came here to say no to war, to say no to genocide in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen, no more war and no more support from the Italian state.”
     
            “I’m here in support of the Palestinian people, especially the children and the women that are being violated and bombed each and every day. It cannot be right that we sit back and watch what Netanyahu is doing. It is enough: Palestine belongs to Palestinian people, not Israelis,” protester Nikewe Jentu told AFP in Cape Town.
     
            In Dublin, hundreds of protesters marched, chanting, “Ceasefire now!” and “Free, Free, Palestine!”
     
In Israel: The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Thursday it would not hold its weekly Saturday rallies in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem due to the “security situation” in the region. But dozens of rallies are still set to take place today in other locations.
     
            French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the complete suspension of the sale of arms used in the war in Gaza, while stressing France has not been involved in their supply.
     
            “Right now, the priority is returning to a political situation, that we stop the delivery of arms being used in the war in Gaza. France is not delivering them,” Macron told French radio station France Inter on Saturday.
     
            Several countries including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom have been criticized by human rights groups for failing to suspend arms sales to Israel as its bombardment of Gaza has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead.
     
            France’s defense minister Sébastien Lecornu has repeatedly insisted that the country mainly supplies “spare parts” to Israel  — worth 15 million euros in 2022 — and has supplied “no weapons.”
     
            This response has failed to satisfy French and international NGOs, including Amnesty International, whose French chief Jean-Claude Samouillier penned an open letter to Macron earlier this year calling on him to suspend the export of war materials entirely.
     
            Last month, the UK government announced the suspension of a fraction of its licenses for items used by the Israeli military in Gaza, which brought bitter criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
     
            Germany put a pause on the approval of new arms export licenses to Israel, according to a Reuters report last week, which cited a source close to the Ministry of Economy.
     
            Macron’s call comes as Israel also engages in an escalating war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where it has been carrying out a new bombing campaign comparable to its aerial assault on Gaza.
     
            Dubai’s Emirates airline has banned pagers and walkie-talkies from its planes, following last month’s attacks on such devices carried by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
     
            “All Passengers travelling on flights to, from or via Dubai are prohibited from transporting pagers and walkie talkies in checked or cabin baggage,” the airline wrote in a statement posted on its website Friday.
     
            It comes weeks after pagers exploded simultaneously across Lebanon, followed by walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion. Lebanese officials blamed Israel for the attacks.
     
            Emirates, the region’s largest airline, said in an update Friday that flights from and to Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, remain canceled up until and including October 15.
     
            The Israeli military has published the names of 10 people who it says were killed by a strike on the occupied West Bank on Thursday.
     
            Altogether, according to the Israel Defense Forces, 12 militants were killed in the attack on the Tulkarem area — one of the highest numbers in a single day in the West Bank since last October.
     
            The IDF said the people killed belonged to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, claiming the strike was carried out to thwart an “attack against Israeli civilians in the immediate future,” and that all 12 people were involved in making explosives or “supporting terrorist activities.”
     
Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi, head of Hamas in Tulkarem, and Jit Radwan, a key operative in the Islamic Jihad in the Tulkarem area, were among those killed, according to the IDF.
     
            The Palestinian health ministry previously said at least 18 people were killed in the strike, and Israeli ally Germany expressed concern over reported civilian deaths in the attack.
     
Some background: The West Bank is a territory that lies between Israel and Jordan, home to 3.3 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation. While Israel fights wars with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, violence has also increased in the West Bank.
     
            Israel has launched large-scale raids in the territory, including one in late August that saw Israel tearing up streets with bulldozers and launching strikes in Tulkarem.
     
            There has also been increasing violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, whose presence is considered illegal under international law.
     
            Lebanon is contending with a “terrible crisis” as it continues to be bombarded by Israeli strikes, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said Saturday.
     
        “I have just landed in Beirut as Lebanon faces a terrible crisis,” Grandi said in a post on X. “Hundreds of thousands of people are left destitute or displaced by Israeli air strikes.”
     
 
            The high commissioner said that he had traveled to the Lebanese capital “in solidarity with those affected, to support the humanitarian effort and to ask for more international help.”
     
Remember: As many as a million people have been displaced in Lebanon in recent weeks, according to Lebanese officials, as Israel has ratcheted up its military campaign against Hezbollah. Over 1,400 people in Lebanon have been killed, and a further 7,500 have been injured, according to the country’s health ministry.
     
            Israel has carried out fresh strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs, launching several missiles at an area close to the airport.
     
            A CNN camera recorded one of the blasts and a CNN team reported seeing smoke billowing from an area less than a mile from the airstrip.
     
            The Lebanese state-run National News Agency said Israel struck Ain al-Sikka square in the Bourj el Barajneh area with four missiles. Bourj el Barajneh is a densely populated neighborhood that is home to a Palestinian refugee camp and many poorer migrants.
     
            The Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, an area of residential neighborhoods that’s also a Hezbollah seat of power, is where Israel has focused many of its attacks during its escalating war with the Iran-backed paramilitary group.
     
            Israel has been bombarding Lebanon at a scale that hasn’t been seen outside of Gaza in the last 20 years, according to air warfare experts.
     
            A leader of Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon has been killed in a rare Israeli airstrike near Lebanon’s northernmost city of Tripoli.
     
            In a joint statement, the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli intelligence agency Shin Bet said they killed Saeed Atallah Ali, “a senior member of (the) Hamas Military Wing in Lebanon,” who they claimed “carried out terrorist attacks against Israeli targets and worked to recruit Hamas operatives inside Lebanon.”
     
            It is believed that Lebanon’s second-largest city, Tripoli, has not been targeted since the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Israel’s strikes have largely focused on the south of the country and on Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut.
     
            Hamas confirmed the death of Atallah Ali, who it described as a leader of the Lebanon branch of its military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades.
     
            In a statement, the group said that Atallah Ali was killed by “treacherous Zionist bombing that targeted his home in the Beddawi refugee camp” near Tripoli. Ali’s wife and two daughters were also killed in the bombing, the statement said.
     
            The Beddawi refugee camp, housing Palestinian refugees, is located on a hill 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) northeast of Tripoli. Footage from the scene showed the damage sustained to the apartment building targeted in the strike. Outside the building, a cordon blocked off two damaged cars surrounded by piles of rubble. Sheets hung out from the balcony of the fifth floor apartment, attempting to conceal some of the damage caused by the strike.
     
Remember: Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has been ongoing for nearly a year, following Hamas’ attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah and Israel have consistently been exchanging fire since October 8. The Iran-backed militant group has said that it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire in Gaza.
     
            Three people suffered minor injuries in a Hezbollah rocket barrage launched at the Deir al-Assad area of northern Israel today, according to the Galilee Medical Center.
     
            Twelve other people received medical assistance to cope with the shock and anxiety of the incident, the hospital said.
     
            Earlier on Saturday, Israeli authorities said they were responding to several reports of direct hits to houses and debris falling in Karmiel and Deir al-Assad.
     
            Footage shared on social media showed minor damage to some buildings and cries and shouts. Another video showed a fire burning in the distance.
     
Remember: Hezbollah has been firing rockets and other projectiles into northern Israel as Lebanon endures an unprecedented Israeli air campaign.
     
            The Iran-backed militant group has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached.
     
            This week saw Israel launch a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon as it targets Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. For the first time since 2006, Israel struck central Beirut, with previous attacks being confined to the city’s southern suburbs.
     
            These developments have marked a dramatic escalation in tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, and suggested that fears of an expanded regional war have materialized.
     
            Meanwhile, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel, and has pledged it will attack again if necessary.
     
Here’s a timeline of this week’s key events: 
 
            Hundreds of foreign nationals who have been flown out of Lebanon have been repatriated in the last 24 hours.
     
            About 185 people from countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Finland landed in the Dutch city of Eindhoven on Friday night, according to the country’s Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp.
     
            A separate evacuation flight from Lebanon arrived in Cyprus Friday night, carrying 38 Cypriots, 11 Greek nationals, two Poles and 19 Lebanese with permanent residency in Cyprus, the Cypriot foreign ministry said in a statement.
     
            Several dozen Polish nationals were evacuated from Lebanon, Poland’s foreign ministry said, arriving in Warsaw Friday night. Two hundred and nineteen “particularly vulnerable Germans” were also evacuated from Lebanon Friday, Germany’s foreign office said.
     
Nigerian nationals in the south of Lebanon have been brought to Beirut and “other safer areas,” Nigeria’s foreign ministry said Friday. The Nigerian government has “commenced preparation for evacuation of Nigerians in Lebanon back to Nigeria,” the ministry added. Kenya’s government is also evacuating its citizens from Lebanon, it said in a statement Friday.
     
            A charter flight supported by the Australian government left Beirut with 229 passengers on board on Saturday, according to Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong. Five Malaysians also landed in Kuala Lumpur on Friday after being evacuated from Lebanon, the country’s foreign ministry said.
     
            Israeli authorities said they were responding to several reports of direct hits to houses and debris falling in Karmiel and Deir al-Assad, northern Israel, after a barrage of rockets was fired by Hezbollah on Saturday.
     
            Footage shared on social media showed minor damage to some buildings. Another video showed a fire burning in the distance.
     
            Israel’s emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) said it had treated 10 people for shock but reported no physical injuries.
     
            Several fire department crews were deployed preventatively in case people had become trapped and to assist with any possible injuries.
     
            Eight firefighting teams were engaging an “extensive fire” near the town of Rosh Pina, authorities said.
     
            Hezbollah has lost contact with a possible successor to its late leader Hassan Nasrallah, according to a Lebanese security source.
     
            The group has not heard from Hashem Safieddine since an Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs targeted him on Friday, the source told CNN Saturday.
     
Some background: Safieddine served as head of Hezbollah’s executive council and, until his predecessor’s death, was seen as one of the most likely heirs to the organization’s highest-ranking seat.
     
            He is a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, and studied alongside him in Iran in the 1980s.
     
            Following the back-to-back explosions that targeted Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies in September, Safieddine said that his organization “will not back down until the end.”
     
            The United States designated Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, and in 2017 designated Safieddine a foreign terrorist.
     
CNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report.
 
            A plane carrying 40 tons of urgent medical aid from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) landed in Lebanon Saturday, under the ‘UAE stands with Lebanon’ campaign, a Lebanese Ministry of Health official told CNN.
     
            The UAE launched its relief campaign to support Lebanon on Saturday, its foreign ministry announced.
     
            “The aid aircraft reflects the UAE’s humanitarian efforts and commitment to supporting the people of Lebanon and demonstrates the close fraternal relations between both nations, particularly in the face of such adversity,” the UAE’s foreign ministry said, noting that the country will send $100 million in aid to Lebanon.
     
            “The UAE has previously expressed its deep concern over increased escalation in Lebanon, as well as the repercussions of this dangerous spillover and its impact on regional stability,” the foreign ministry said.
     
            It comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced nearly $157 million in US humanitarian assistance Friday to “support populations affected by conflict in Lebanon and the region.”
     
            As many as one million people have been displaced in the country in recent weeks, according to Lebanon’s crisis management center, as Israel has ratcheted up its military campaign against Hezbollah. This includes more than 200,000 people, mostly Lebanese and Syrians, who have fled across the border into Syria, according to the United Nations.
     
            The Israeli military has claimed to have dismantled several Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and tunnels during a series of localized raids in the border region of southern Lebanon, where a ground operation is underway.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that Israeli soldiers are carrying out focused raids on what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” both above and below ground.
     
            According to the IDF, the targets, concealed in mountainous, densely built-up areas rigged with explosives, included weapons caches, observation posts and missile launch sites.
     
            Earlier, Hezbollah said it had attacked an Israeli tank and repelled an Israeli assault on the town of Adaisseh. When asked by CNN, the IDF said it was not aware of these incidents.
     
            New Israeli airstrikes have struck Beirut’s southern suburbs on Saturday, the scene of daily attacks over the past week.
     
            CNN teams saw large plumes of dark smoke coming from the area, while the state-run National News Agency of Lebanon (NNA) also reported on fresh Israeli strikes.
     
            Israel has continued to batter Lebanon with strikes into Saturday, in an aerial campaign that has killed over 1,400 people, injured nearly 7,500 others and displaced more than one million people in less than three weeks, according to Lebanese officials.
     
            Israel has refused to rule out targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, while reports from Hamas-linked media have claimed Israeli forces have struck near Lebanon’s second-largest city of Tripoli for the first time.
     
Here are the latest updates: 
 
            More than 200,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria since Israel started its bombing campaign inside the country, the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Saturday.
 
            Among those are both Lebanese citizens and Syrians living in Lebanon, Grandi said.
     
            Relief efforts are being carried out by the UN, the Syrian Red Crescent and other organizations at border crossings, he added.
     
Some context: Lebanese authorities have said that over 1.2 million Lebanese people have been displaced since fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated last month. Many families are now living on the streets.
     
            Last week, Lebanon’s country director for Relief International, Giacomo Lapo Baldini, told CNN that hundreds of thousands of people don’t have access to clean water after facilities were hit by Israel.
     
            Hezbollah said it struck an Israeli tank advancing near the outskirts of the Lebanese village of Maroun early on Saturday.
     
            The militant group said it had hit the tank “directly” with a guided missile.
     
            It also claimed that the Israeli crew members inside the tank were either killed or injured by the strike.
     
            In a separate incident, Hezbollah said it had repelled an overnight assault by Israeli forces near the town of Adaisseh. In its last update on the incident several hours ago, Hezbollah said “clashes are ongoing.”
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces on these reports but has not heard back.
     
            Israel launched what it calls a “limited” ground incursion into Lebanon earlier in the week.
     
            The Israeli bombardment of Lebanon continued Saturday morning, following strikes across the country and at least a dozen air raids on Beirut’s southern suburbs overnight, according to the National News Agency of Lebanon (NNA).
     
            The Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) Arabic-language spokesperson told residents who had previously been ordered to leave their homes not to return in a statement on Saturday. Israel has hit the southern suburbs of Beirut every day for the past week.
     
        “The IDF airstrikes are ongoing. For your safety and the safety of your families, do not return to your homes until further notice.” Avichay Adraee wrote on X.
     
 
            Between 12:50 AM and 2:44 AM local time, Adraee issued three separate warnings to residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate ahead of planned airstrikes.
     
            “You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will operate in the near future,” he wrote in each of the orders, which included maps of the specified areas.
     
            Elsewhere in Lebanon, NNA reported strikes in areas including the Beqaa valley in the east and the city of Tyre on the Mediterranean coast, as well as in southern communities closer to the border with Israel.
     
            Dozens of people took part in a group run in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday, calling for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
     
            The gathering is the group’s fiftieth run since the war began and comes just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the brutal Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.
     
            Runner Eili David said that he felt “terrible,” adding that he believes the hostages have been living in “inhumane conditions” for the past year and “we still have not brought them back.”
     
        “I live in two different realities, and (in) one of them it’s been one year since October 7. It feels like it was yesterday. I feel hopeless and helpless that we still did not bring everyone home. It’s absurd.”
     
 
            On the possibility of staying hopeful that a hostage deal will be struck, David said he “has to be.”
     
            Another runner said that he thinks about the hostages in Gaza “every day, all day.” He added was still “very hopeful” for their return, saying it was “possible if our leadership wants it.”
     
            A leader of the Lebanon branch of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, was killed by an airstrike near the northern city of Tripoli, according to a media outlet affiliated with the group.
     
            The Israeli military has not commented on the report, which if confirmed would be the first strike in the Tripoli region, Lebanon’s second-largest city.
     
        “Hamas mourns the leader of the al-Qassam brigades, Saeed Atallah Ali, and three members of his family, as a result of the bombing of his home in the Beddawi refugee camp in Tripoli,” Al-Aqsa TV reported on Saturday.
     
 
            Hamas has yet to officially comment on the reports.

            A hospital in southern Lebanon was evacuated following an Israeli strike that left nine medical staff injured, according to state media.
     
            The strike – in the vicinity of the Martyr Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil – came after an evacuation order from the Israeli military, the National News Agency of Lebanon (NNA) reported, citing a statement from the hospital.
     
            The statement added that most of the nine injured workers were in serious condition.
     
            The Israeli military said in a statement on Saturday that it had struck a mosque adjacent to the hospital which it said was being used as a Hezbollah command center.
     
            “Before the strike, notices were sent to residents and conversations were held with significant parties in the villages in which the IDF identified Hezbollah utilizing hospitals in defiance of the laws of armed conflict – demanding that any military activity carried out from the hospitals should stop immediately,” the military said.
     
            One of Lebanon’s southern-most hospitals, the Marjayoun Governmental Hospital, was taken out of service Friday after Israeli strikes hit close to the facility, the hospital director Dr Mones Kalakish told CNN.
     
Medical facilities impacted: Israeli bombardment has taken a heavy toll on Lebanon’s health infrastructure in recent days.
     
            On Thursday the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 37 health facilities had been forced to close in southern Lebanon and 28 healthcare workers had been killed in the previous 24-hours alone.
     
            A surgeon in Beirut has accused Israel of waging a “war on children” in Lebanon, drawing a comparison to how large numbers of young people have faced death and injury during Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.
     
            Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon at American University of Beirut Medical Center, who previously worked in Gaza, gave his account from the ground to CNN’s Michael Holmes on Saturday.
     
            “We are seeing [a] similar pattern to what I was seeing in Gaza in October and November last year,” he said.
     
            He said children were being wounded in their homes and in some cases seeing multiple family members killed.
     
        “What we see again is a war on children,” the doctor said.
     
 
According to UNICEF, more than 690 children in Lebanon have been injured in the past six weeks and at least 100 killed over the past 11 days as Israel has ramped up strikes against Hezbollah.
     
            Israel says it takes steps to minimize civilian harm, such as making phone calls and sending text messages to residents in buildings designated for attack. Human rights groups like Amnesty International say such warnings do not absolve Israel of responsibilities under international humanitarian law to limit civilian harm.
     
            Abu-Sittah, who serves as director of the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department at the prestigious American University hospital, also spoke of the similarities between the injuries inflicted by the two Israeli offensives in Gaza and Lebanon.
     
        “We’ve been seeing similar patterns: blast injuries to the face in these children, amputated limbs, crush injuries as they’re taken from underneath the rubble, and the health system is struggling with all of these,” he noted.
     
 
            More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and more than 96,006 injured since Israel launched its war on Hamas following the group’s October 7 attack, according to the Gaza health ministry. The health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its figures but says most of the dead are women and children. Israel earlier this year said it had killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers.
     
            Israel has not given assurances to the Biden administration that targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities is off the table in retaliation to the Iranian ballistic missile strikes earlier this week, a top US State Department official told CNN on Friday.
     
            The official added that it is “really hard to tell” if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks to retaliate.
     
        “We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees,” the official said when asked by CNN if Israel has assured the US that Iran’s nuclear sites are off the table.
     
 
            Earlier this week, President Joe Biden said the US would not support Israel targeting Iran’s nuclear program.
     
            US officials also do not yet have clarity as to when Israel’s response will be decided upon, or enacted.
     
            Asked whether Israel would use the one year anniversary of the Hamas attack to retaliate against Iran, the official said “it is really hard to tell.”
     
            “I think in some ways they would want to avoid the seventh, so in my estimation if there is anything it would likely be before or after,” the official said, pointing to the solemnity of that day and any Israeli retaliation potentially taking away from what that day was all about.
     
            The US has been working for almost a year to prevent the conflict from turning into a bigger war — and has so far done so, the official said. Right now, “this is on the edge,” the official added.
     
            Hezbollah has said it repelled an Israeli incursion near the town of Adaisseh in southern Lebanon with clashes following a second ongoing, according to two statements on Saturday
     
            The militant group said Israeli infantry first attempted to advance toward the town at 11:00 p.m. on Friday.
     
        “Fighters from the Islamic Resistance engaged with them, resulting in a massive explosion in the advancing force, which was forced to retreat, causing casualties among their ranks,” Hezbollah said.
     
 
            The second statement said Israeli soldiers had advanced again toward Adaisseh at 1:50 a.m. on Saturday.
     
            The statement said its fighters “confronted the attempt to advance, and clashes are ongoing.”
     
            CNN has contacted the Israeli military for comment on the reported confrontations.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday that two of its soldiers from the Golani Brigade were killed in “northern Israel” in a drone attack that came from the east.
     
            The IDF didn’t specify who it suspects of carrying out the attack but it happened on Wednesday, the same day the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of several Iran-backed militias, said it conducted drone attacks on three targets in what it called  “separate operations north of our occupied territories.”
     
            Hamas praised the group for their support of Palestinian people, saying the Iraqi Islamic Resistance’s drone operation targeted Israeli forces in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in the northeast, “resulting in deaths and injuries.”
     
            The Islamic Resistance in Iraq also said it conducted three other drone attacks on Friday in the Golan Heights and Tiberias.
     
            The Golan Heights is a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981. It remains under Israeli government control and is considered to be occupied territory by much of the international community.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced nearly $157 million in US humanitarian assistance Friday to “support populations affected by conflict in Lebanon and the region,” as the country continues to voice support for the “limited” Israeli military campaign in Lebanon that has triggered mass displacement.
     
            “This funding will address new and existing needs of internally displaced persons and refugee populations inside Lebanon and the communities that host them,” Blinken said in a statement. “The assistance will also support those fleeing to neighboring Syria.”
     
            Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced in the country in recent weeks as Israel has ratcheted up its military campaign against Hezbollah, including more than 100,000 people, mostly Lebanese and Syrians, who have fled across the border into Syria, according to the United Nations.
     
            US officials say they support Israel’s military campaign, but note they have concerns about the humanitarian impact.
     
            “We do think it’s appropriate that Israel, at this point, is bringing terrorists to justice and trying to push – trying – and launching these limited incursions, what at least at this point are limited incursions, trying to push Hezbollah back from the border,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday.
     
            “Ultimately our goal is a diplomatic resolution,” he said.
     
            The United Nations refused a request from Israel to move some its peacekeepers near the Lebanese border just days before Israel began its ground operation earlier this week.
     
            United Nations Interim Force In Lebanonn (UNIFIL), the UN’s peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, received a request from the Israeli military to “vacate” several positions near the Blue Line — the demarcation zone between Israel and Lebanon which has been the center of intense fighting in recent months, according to Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations.
     
            The UN already anticipated the prospect of Israel carrying out “targeted ground operations” in Lebanon and decided to stay put in such an instance, Lacroix told a briefing Thursday.
     
            “We had made a very considerate, thorough and sorely discussed decision that it would be better for UNIFIL, for peacekeepers, and in terms of our responsibility to the mandate to stay in those positions,” the chief added.
     
Some context: UN peacekeepers have been stationed along the roughly 120 kilometer Blue Line since it was drawn up by the UN in 2000 to ensure Israel’s complete withdrawal from Lebanon. UN peacekeepers were drawn from armies of several nations to monitor the situation along the Blue Line which separates the two states.
     
            The Israeli military said it killed at least seven militants, including a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, in Thursday’s strike on the West Bank’s Tulkarem area, using at least one fighter jet.
     
            Israel described Ghaith Radwan as “a key operative” in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad operation in Tulkarem. The group’s military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, confirmed Radwan’s death, calling him one of the leaders of the Tulkarem Battalion in the occupied West Bank.
     
            The strike killed other Islamic Jihad members as well as operatives of Hamas, the Israeli military said, alleging the militants were gathering to carry out a terror attack against Israel in the “immediate future.”
     
            Hamas confirmed on Friday that one of its commanders, Zahi Yaser Oufi, was among eight members killed in the attack. Israel said Oufi was the leader of Hamas’ network in the Tulkarem area.
     
            At least 18 people were killed in the strike, the Palestinian health ministry said Thursday.
     
            Germany, an ally of Israel, said the high number of civilian victims is shocking.
     
            “In the fight against terror, the Israeli army is committed to the protection of civilians in the West Bank. Palestinians, like the Israelis, have the right to a life of safety,” the German Foreign Office posted to X on Friday.
     
            Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last Friday has driven the Iran-backed group even deeper underground. A successor has not yet been named. And perhaps most unusually, a funeral — at least a public one — has not yet been held.
     
Why this matters: According to Islamic norms, the dead must be laid to rest at the soonest opportunity, normally within 24 hours. That is especially true for Muslims slain by an enemy state. Questions swirled and reports emerged on Friday morning that the late leader had been buried in secret. But a source close to Hezbollah told CNN this was not true. “Nothing has been decided,” the source said, about the time and place of the burial.
     
            Coupled with the lack of a clear successor, this has shrouded the group in more secrecy. For a week, Hezbollah’s public statements have been cursory at best. This strikes a sharp contrast with the Iran-backed Shia group’s practice of shoring up community support with public gatherings, and Nasrallah’s long and rousing speeches.
     
            Still, this all underscores the fact that this is a very different war. During the last all-out war with Israel in 2006, Nasrallah gave televised speeches nearly every day. The leadership is operating more clandestinely than ever before, after having been confronted by the most extensive Israeli infiltration of its ranks in its history.
     
            Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon is heavier than the height of the United States’ fight against ISIS, data from a conflict monitoring group shows.
     
            Israel has pummeled Lebanon with an unprecedented airstrike campaign in less than three weeks, killing more than 1,400 people, injuring nearly 7,500 others and displacing more than 1 million people from their homes, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            To put that into context, over the course of two days, on September 24 and September 25, the Israel military said it used 2,000 munitions and carried out 3,000 strikes.
     
            In comparison, for most of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the US carried out less than 3,000 strikes a year, barring the first year of the invasion, where around 6,500 strikes were carried out, according to data from Airwars analyzed by CNN.
     
            Israel’s bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, Airwars said.

Look back at photos from the last year of the devastating conflict.","Oct 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Unknown,Middle East,"In the early hours of October 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched a brutal air and ground assault in Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Within hours of the terror attack, Israel struck back and has since mounted an all-out war against Hamas that has claimed more than 40,000 Palestinian lives in Gaza over the course of the past year, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.  After more than three decades of Israeli restrictions on the flow of both people and goods into and out of Gaza, Palestinians in the enclave Gaza were already suffering from chronic shortages of food, clean water, electricity, medicine and housing. Many lived in refugee camps after experiencing generations of displacement. Thousands of images have been taken since October 7: Dead bodies strewn on the ground, lying side by side near a bus stop in Israel. Stunned Palestinian children, clutching each other and running for cover as rockets stream above them. An Israeli woman running for safety as sirens blare and smoke billows in the background. Young girls in Gaza surveying what’s left of their destroyed and smoldering homes. Photographers have risked their lives to show the world what is happening. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 116 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war began, making it the deadliest period for journalists since the CPJ began gathering data in 1992. Of those, 111 were Palestinian, two were Israeli and three were Lebanese. Ziv Koren, a 30-year veteran photojournalist with Polaris Images, was woken up on October 7 by the blaring sound of emergency sirens in Israel. He instinctively rushed out of his home in Tel Aviv on his motorcycle to document the scene. Still not fully comprehending the “magnitude of what was happening” in those early morning hours, he was “shocked” to see what Hamas militants had done. Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf was front and center in the early months of the war. “Taking pictures of corpses hurts me most,” she said during a CNN interview. “These are human beings, not just bags of flesh, blood, and bones. Bodies of all sizes from newborns to grandparents. These are people who dreamed of living until tomorrow and had hope they would survive the war.” On the eve of the anniversary of a war that seemingly has no end in sight, Koren says he strongly believes in the power of photography.  “I still go out every day — 19 hours each day. This is for future generations to see that these are visual documents,” he said. He has shot nearly 350,000 images since last year. The photographs are capturing history as it unfolds, “and these need to be taken every single day.” Editor's note: This gallery contains graphic images.

            The official added that it is “really hard to tell” if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks to retaliate.
     
        “We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees,” the official said when asked by CNN if Israel has assured the US that Iran’s nuclear sites are off the table.
     
 
            Earlier this week, President Joe Biden said the US would not support Israel targeting Iran’s nuclear program.
     
            US officials also do not yet have clarity as to when Israel’s response will be decided upon, or enacted.
     
            Asked whether Israel would use the one year anniversary of the Hamas attack to retaliate against Iran, the official said “it is really hard to tell.”
     
        “I think in some ways they would want to avoid the seventh, so in my estimation if there is anything it would likely be before or after,” the official said, pointing to the solemnity of that day and any Israeli retaliation potentially taking away from what that day was all about.
     
 
            The US has been working for almost a year to prevent the conflict from turning into a bigger war — and has so far done so, the official said. Right now, “this is on the edge,” the official added.
     
            Israel has continued its extensive bombing campaign in southern Lebanon, where CNN teams heard blasts in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday.
     
Data from a conflict monitoring group shows that Israel, which is at war with the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, is carrying out the “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades.
     
            To put it into context: Over the course of two days, on September 24 and September 25, the Israel military said it used 2,000 munitions and carried out 3,000 strikes. In comparison, for most of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the US carried out less than 3,000 strikes a year, barring the first year of the invasion, according to data from Airwars analyzed by CNN.
     
Here’s what else has happened so far Friday:
 
Israeli airstrike on Lebanon-Syria border: The strike, an official said, destroyed the road leading to the Masnaa crossing with Syria, a major transport link that tens of thousands of people have used to flee the escalation of hostilities. Israel also struck the Masnaa crossing area in its last all-out war with Hezbollah in 2006. The Israel Defense Forces said it had struck a tunnel used for smuggling weapons into Lebanon, but the country’s economic minister said most weapon smuggling takes place through “illegal channels, illegal roads” and not the main crossing. Taking out the only land border entry point into Syria has left Lebanon more isolated, adding “another layer of desperation” for those fleeing and seeking shelter, Amin Salam told CNN’s Isa Soares.
     
Meanwhile in Iran: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led a rare commemoration service for slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as part of Friday prayers in Tehran. Khamenei said Iran will strike Israel further if necessary, after launching its largest-ever attack on its regional adversary Tuesday. Thousands of people gathered at Tehran’s Grand Mosque for the prayer service, according to the broadcast from state media outlet IRIB.
     
No public funeral yet for Nasrallah: A source close to Hezbollah told CNN “nothing has been decided” about the time and place of Nasrallah’s burial, as Israel’s intensive bombing campaign has battered many Shia-majority neighborhoods and towns in Lebanon, leaving no conceivably safe place to hold it.
     
Hezbollah attack: Israeli police reported heavy damage in northern Israel following a Hezbollah rocket barrage on Friday. Several fires broke out but no injuries were reported. Hezbollah said it had targeted the city of Kiryat Shmona and surrounding areas with a rocket barrage “in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli assaults on cities, villages, and civilians.”
     
Israel tells more Lebanese residents to evacuate: Residents of more than 30 villages in southern Lebanon were asked to leave their homes and move north on Friday. Some of the villages listed in the new order had been included in previous Israeli warnings. The IDF would notify residents when it was safe to return to their homes, Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X. About 1 million displaced people in Lebanon have sought shelter from the fighting.
     
More Hezbollah members killed: The IDF said it killed the head of Hezbollah’s communication unit in strikes on southern Beirut on Thursday afternoon local time. Hezbollah has not yet made any announcements about casualties. The IDF says it has killed “approximately 250” Hezbollah militants since launching its ground offensive in southern Lebanon earlier this week.
     
Health care “under attack”: Dozens of medical workers were killed over a 24-hour period of Israeli bombardment in Lebanon, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday. At least 37 health facilities have closed in southern Lebanon and several Beirut hospitals have evacuated staff and patients, with health and humanitarian workers struggling to provide care with limited supplies. “Health care continues to come under attack,” he said at a briefing in Geneva.
     
            The Israeli military said it killed at least seven militants, including a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, in Thursday’s strike on the West Bank’s Tulkarem area, using at least one fighter jet.
     
            Israel described Ghaith Radwan as “a key operative” in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad operation in Tulkarem. The group’s military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, confirmed Radwan’s death, calling him one of the leaders of the Tulkarem Battalion in the occupied West Bank.
     
            The strike killed other Islamic Jihad members as well as operatives of Hamas, the Israeli military said, alleging the militants were gathering to carry out a terror attack against Israel in the “immediate future.”
     
            Hamas confirmed on Friday that one of its commanders, Zahi Yaser Oufi, was among eight members killed in the attack. Israel said Oufi was the leader of Hamas’ network in the Tulkarem area.
     
            At least 18 people were killed in the strike, the Palestinian health ministry said Thursday.
     
            Germany, an ally of Israel, said the high number of civilian victims is shocking.
     
            “In the fight against terror, the Israeli army is committed to the protection of civilians in the West Bank. Palestinians, like the Israelis, have the right to a life of safety,” the German Foreign Office posted to X on Friday.
     
            Earlier this week, CNN asked followers on social media if they had questions about the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.
     
            From your responses, we picked some of the most-asked topics and put the key question to CNN’s diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson.
     
            After Iran’s attack on Israel earlier this week, some followers asked how the situation in the region could escalate and what Israel might do next.
     
            Watch Robertson’s answers to your questions:
     
            What Alaa’s family needs more than anything are toilets.
     
            “Our women hold it in until the night and then go relieve themselves behind the cars for privacy,” Alaa says. “It’s a matter of dignity. We care about our dignity, just like you.”
     
            His is one of dozens of Syrian families camped out in a parking lot in the heart of Sidon, southern Lebanon’s largest city. Due to widespread discrimination against migrant workers and refugees, they are cut off from the dwindling resources of a city already struggling to house thousands of people fleeing the Israeli bombardment further south.
     
            The nearby mosque prevents them from using its toilets, and they are barred from entering the schools-turned-shelters dedicated to displaced Lebanese. They are constantly harassed by citizens and city officials, Alaa says.
     
            After delivering an angry tirade, Alaa sits on the pavement next to his family. A couple of blankets hanging between two poles grants them a bit of privacy. Around them, families rest on straw mats and mattresses recently provided by the United Nations refugee agency.
     
            The people here constantly move their children and belongings to wherever the surrounding tin roofs might cast some shade from the punishing sun. It looks like an encampment in a state of flux.
     
            Many families have approached CNN journalists thinking we are representatives of an aid agency, asking to be registered so they can receive food and medication for their children and elderly.
     
            “Some NGOs donate a meal every now and then, but we mainly rely on the money we have to buy food for everyone,” says Ibrahim, a Syrian agricultural worker.
     
            The US military said Friday that it carried out strikes on 15 targets belonging to the Houthi rebels in Yemen.
     
            The attack, which included strikes targeting the group’s military capabilities, was carried out to “protect freedom of navigation” in the Red Sea following weeks of Houthi attacks on ships bound for Israel, the US said.
     
            The Iran-backed Houthis accused the US and UK of carrying out airstrikes in four cities across Yemen on Friday. Seven of those strikes targeted the Hodeidah Airport and the Katheeb area in Hodeidah, the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported.
     
            The British defense ministry said the UK was not involved in strikes on Yemen today, and Israel’s military said it isn’t aware of the strikes.
     
            Footage geolocated by CNN shows billowing grey smoke in northern Hodeidah, a Houthi-controlled port city in western Yemen. The video was captured from a vantage point along the Red Sea.
     
How the Houthis fit in to the region’s conflicts: The Houthis, like Hezbollah and Hamas, are among the Iranian proxy groups aligned against Israel.
     
            Clashes with the Iran-backed groups have intensified since Hamas’ October 7 attacks and the ensuing Israeli military offensive in Gaza, with the Houthis saying their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea are made in solidarity with the Palestinians.
     
            Israel’s escalating war with Hezbollah has only deepened fears of a wider regional war involving Iran and the various militant groups.
     
            The Israeli military urged medical teams in Lebanon to avoid cooperating with Hezbollah, warning that it would take “appropriate measures” if their rescue vehicles are used by the militant group.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces has accused Hezbollah of “exploiting” such rescue vehicles to transport what it described as terrorists and weapons.
     
            “Any vehicle proven to be used by an armed terrorist for terrorist purposes, regardless of its type, will be subject to appropriate measures to prevent its military use,” IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned.
     
            Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last Friday has driven the Iran-backed group even deeper underground. A successor has not yet been named. And perhaps most unusually, a funeral — at least a public one — has not yet been held.
     
Why this matters: According to Islamic norms, the dead must be laid to rest at the soonest opportunity, normally within 24 hours. That is especially true for Muslims slain by an enemy state. Questions swirled and reports emerged on Friday morning that the late leader had been buried in secret. But a source close to Hezbollah told CNN this was not true. “Nothing has been decided,” the source said, about the time and place of the burial.
     
            Coupled with the lack of a clear successor, this has shrouded the group in more secrecy. For a week, Hezbollah’s public statements have been cursory at best. This strikes a sharp contrast with the Iran-backed Shia group’s practice of shoring up community support with public gatherings, and Nasrallah’s long and rousing speeches.
     
More background: On Friday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei commemorated Nasrallah in Friday prayers, which, in a rare move, he led. Yet there was no public gathering to mark this in Lebanon.
     
            There are security reasons for that, as well as for the lack of a public funeral. Israel’s intensive bombing campaign has battered many Shia-majority neighborhoods and towns, so there is no conceivably safe place to hold it.
     
            Israel’s airstrikes have decimated its command and control and have also killed a large number of civilians, according to the Ministry of Health, and displaced over a million. More than 100 children have been killed in Israeli strikes in the last 11 days alone, according to UNICEF.
     
            Still, this all underscores the fact that this is a very different war. During the last all-out war with Israel in 2006, Nasrallah gave televised speeches nearly every day. The leadership is operating more clandestinely than ever before, after having been confronted by the most extensive Israeli infiltration of its ranks in its history.
     
            Lebanon’s Minister of Economy and Trade said most weapon smuggling does not take place through the Masnaa border crossing with Syria, which Israel struck on Thursday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said it hit an “underground tunnel crossing” at that location to prevent weapons from being smuggled into Lebanon. Amin Salam told CNN’s Isa Soares on Friday that Lebanon intends to inspect the site after the rubble is cleared but that most smuggling takes place through illegal channels rather than the official entry point at Masnaa.
     
        “Smuggling weapons into Lebanon or smuggling anything inside or outside Lebanon mostly is not done through this channel. Mostly it is done through illegal channels, illegal roads, in Lebanon that are not like this one,” he said.
     
 
            The Masnaa border crossing lies in the Bekaa Valley on the Beirut-Damascus international highway, a major transport link for people and goods between Lebanon and Syria. Tens of thousands of people have used the highway to flee Israeli bombardment in recent days.
     
            Salam said that taking out the crossing — the only land border entry point into Syria — has left Lebanon more isolated. It will make moving goods and people between the two countries more difficult, he said.
     
            “It only adds another layer of desperation for people that are moving or running away, seeking shelter from Lebanon to Syria,” Salam said.
     
            Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon is heavier than the height of the United States’ fight against ISIS, data from a conflict monitoring group shows.
     
            Israel has pummeled Lebanon with an unprecedented airstrike campaign in less than three weeks, killing more than 1,400 people, injuring nearly 7,500 others and displacing more than one million people from their homes, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            To put that into context, over the course of two days, on September 24 and September 25, the Israel military said it used 2,000 munitions and carried out 3,000 strikes.
     
            In comparison, for most of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the US carried out less than 3,000 strikes a year, barring the first year of the invasion, where around 6,500 strikes were carried out, according to data from Airwars analyzed by CNN.
     
            Israel’s bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, Airwars said.
     
            The majority of the fire exchanged between Israel and Hezbollah since the start of the war has come from Israeli strikes, drones, shelling and missiles on Lebanese territory, according to data from ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data), an organization that collects data on violent conflict.
     
            Israel has launched nearly 9,000 attacks into Lebanon since October 8 and Hezbollah launched 1,500 attacks in that same time frame, according to the ACLED data.
     
            Israel’s power plants and gas refineries could be hit in response to an attack on Iran, the deputy commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said, according to local media.
     
        “Iran is a large and vast country and has many economic centers, while Israel has three power plants and several refineries. We can target all of these at once,” Brig. Gen. Ali Fadavi said.
     
 
            Fadavi said Iran will target all energy sites if Israel makes “a mistake.”
     
Remember: Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles on Israeli cities Tuesday in response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last week. The strikes caused minimal damage.
     
            In Beirut, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi also warned of a “harsh response” if Israel attacks, saying so far his country had only attacked Israeli security and military sites.
     
            His comments echoed an earlier statement from the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said earlier today that Tuesday’s Iranian attack on Israel was the “least punishment” and that Iran will attack Israel again “if needs be.”
     
            Araghchi was speaking to reporters in the Lebanese capital of Beirut after meeting Lebanese parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri — a Hezbollah ally and a key figure in negotiations for a ceasefire with Israel.
     
            One of Lebanon’s southernmost hospitals went out of service Friday after Israeli strikes hit close to the facility, the hospital’s director, Dr. Mones Kalakish, told CNN.
     
            The strike killed seven people outside the entrance of the Marjayoun Governmental Hospital, according to Kalakish.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
        “We held on for as long as we could, but this morning we came under fire, and we had to evacuate,” Kalakish told CNN. “We were panicked and terrified.”
     
 
Medical workers in dire conditions: Thirty-seven heath facilities have closed in southern Lebanon since the start of Israel’s current bombardment campaign nearly two weeks ago, according to the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On Thursday, 28 health workers were killed by Israeli strikes, Ghebreyesus said.
     
            Israeli forces have rained down bombs on the country’s southernmost territory in recent days as they prepare for potentially further ground operations in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of people have fled the area out of fear for their safety.
     
            Israel’s military says it has killed “approximately 250” Hezbollah militants since launching a ground offensive in southern Lebanon earlier this week.
     
            About 100 of the Iran-backed group’s fighters have been killed in the last 24 hours, the Israel Defense Forces said in a briefing Friday.
     
        “What we have seen in these days of more intense fighting … I can tell you that alongside our casualties we’ve been able to inflict a serious blow to Hezbollah, to its senior level and to its tactical level commanders,” the IDF’s international spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, told reporters.
     
 
            Israel has described its operations in southern Lebanon as “limited, localized and targeted.”
     
            In response to a CNN question about the disparity between such statements and the large number of southern Lebanese villages being asked the evacuate, Shoshani said, “Sadly, Hezbollah has embedded widely and deeply into Lebanon.”
     
            Another US organized flight departed from Lebanon on Thursday and arrived in Germany on Friday morning local time, according to a State Department spokesperson.
     
            The flight was only about a third full. According to the spokesperson, it had the capacity to carry 300 passengers, but departed with just 97 passengers onboard.
     
            Two other government organized flights have left from Beirut. Those carriers went to Istanbul.
     
        “To date, we have assisted approximately 350 U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), and their immediate family members depart Lebanon via State Department organized flights,” the spokesperson said Friday morning.
     
 
            State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday that the agency is “going to continue to organize those flights as long as the security situation is challenging, as long as there aren’t sufficient commercial options available, and as long as there’s demand.”
     
            The fate of a possible successor to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is unclear following an Israeli airstrike on Beirut.
     
            An Israeli official told CNN that Hashem Safieddine was the target of the strike, but it is unclear if he was killed.
     
            Safieddine is a maternal cousin of Nasrallah – the two studied in Iran together in the early 1980s. Just like Nasrallah, Safieddine is a staunch critic of Israel and the West, with deep alliances with the Iranian leadership.
     
            Safieddine served as head of Hezbollah’s executive council and, until his predecessor’s death, was seen as one of the most likely heirs to the organization’s highest-ranking seat. The group has yet to name a successor to Nasrallah.

            Oil producing Gulf Arab states are likely concerned about implications of an Israeli retaliation against Iran, especially if Israel targets Iran’s oil installations, a regional expert told CNN.
     
            Such an attack would cause significant economic damage, threaten other oil facilities in the region, and create an ecological disaster, with oil potentially spilling into the Persian Gulf from damaged Iranian pipelines, said Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow for Middle East Policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
     
            Concern of a wider war that could involve the targeting of the region’s oil facilities has already sparked a jolt in oil prices.
 
            Iran has signaled in the past that if it can’t sell its oil, then no one else in the region can either, Alhasan said, raising questions about the safety of Gulf Arab oil installations if Iran’s are hit by Israel.
     
        “There are real concerns about the first-order and second-order implications of such an Israeli attack,” he told CNN, noting that as long as Gulf states maintain a line of neutrality, Iran is unlikely to resurface past hostilities that directly target Gulf Arab states.
     
 
            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met with Gulf Arab ministers in Qatar’s capital Doha on Thursday.
     
            “Our neighbors are our priority,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on X. “#StrongRegion our goal—#Dialogue is a must,” he said.
     
            A UAE official told CNN that regional discussions are focused on “the necessity of concerted regional and international efforts to halt the escalation and prevent further loss of life.”
     
            Pezeshkian said he told the Qatari ruler in Doha that the “troubles” brought upon the region by Israel are “due to the existence of differences and factions among us,” according to the state news agency IRNA.
 
            CNN teams heard blasts in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Smoke was seen rising from the area.
     
            Israel has been striking the neighborhood for over a week.
     
            Israel’s military says it struck an “underground tunnel crossing” on the Lebanese-Syrian border on Thursday to “prevent weapons from being smuggled into Lebanese territories”.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the tunnel’s operations were led by “the 4400 Unit, the unit responsible for the transportation of weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.”
     
            “Additionally, infrastructure sites adjacent to the Masnaa border crossing between Syria and Lebanon were struck last night,” the IDF added in its statement on Friday.
     
            An Israeli airstrike near the main Lebanon-Syria border crossing halted traffic in both directions, a Lebanese official said on Friday.
     
            The strike, late on Thursday, destroyed the road leading to the Masnaa crossing with Syria, Public Works Minister Ali Hamie told CNN, adding the checkpoint “has been cut off.”
     
            The Masnaa border crossing lies in the Beqaa valley on the Beirut-Damascus international highway, a major transport link for people and goods between the two countries.
     
            The highway has been used by tens of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardment in recent days.
     
            Gazans have described their panic as an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA school in the besieged enclave’s central Nuseirat camp.
     
            The grandmother of a baby injured in the attack told CNN: “Suddenly a rocket hit and everyone was gone.
     
        “I took the little ones and ran. I don’t know what happened to their mother.”
     
 
            Another grandmother was seen cradling the body of her 11-month-old granddaughter, who was killed while sheltering in a school.
     
            Several schools turned into makeshift shelters were hit by Israeli airstrikes this week. Israel claims Hamas uses schools as command and control center and civilians as human shields, a tactic Hamas has denied.
     
CNN’s Mohammad Al Sawalhi and Abeer Salman contributed reporting to this post.
 
            Israel’s military said it killed the head of Hezbollah’s communication unit in strikes on southern Beirut Thursday afternoon local time.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said Mohammad Rashid Skaafi had been leading the group’s communications since 2000.
     
            Hezbollah has not yet made any announcements about casualties following Thursday’s Israeli strikes in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
     
Some background: Israel’s barrage of strikes across Lebanon on Thursday killed at least 37 people and wounded 151, the Lebanese health ministry said. The Israeli military said Thursday it had hit Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters in Beirut.
     
            The IDF has pledged to continue to strike Hezbollah targets in Beirut, the Bekaa valley and southern Lebanon.
     
            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi traveled to the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on Friday for meetings with government officials, a week after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Araghchi met Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and expressed Iran’s commitment to Lebanon and “its support in the face of Israeli aggression,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.
     
            Iran’s top diplomat said his country “will launch a diplomatic campaign to support Lebanon and request a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.”
     
            It is unclear if Araghchi will meet Hezbollah officials during his visit.
     
Remember: Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut by Israel last Friday. His killing marked a major escalation in the long-running Israel-Gaza conflict and deepens fears of a wider regional war.
     
            The UAE believes that sectarian militias in the Middle East have cost the Arab world and hopes the future of the region is an Arab project that is “reconciled with its surroundings,” a top official said.
     
        “In light of the wars and crises that threaten Arab and regional security, we have no choice but to restore the concept of the nation state and respect its independence and sovereignty,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE president’s diplomatic adviser, said on X.
     
 
            “The era of militias with its sectarian and regional dimensions has cost the Arabs dearly and burdened the region,” he added, in an apparent reference to Iran-backed Shiite militias in the region.
     
        “The future is for security, peace and prosperity with an independent Arab project that is reconciled with its surroundings,” Gargash said.
     
 
            He also said that the two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict “remains the cornerstone to stop the series of recurring crises.”
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that Tuesday’s Iranian attack on Israel was the “least punishment.”
     
            Iran will attack Israel again “if needs be,” he said in a Friday speech in Tehran.
     
        “The brilliant action of our armed forces a couple of nights ago was completely legal and legitimate,” Khamenei said.
     
 
            Keeping with Iranian Friday prayer traditions, he delivered his speech with what appeared to be the barrel of a rifle next to him.
     
            Khamenei dedicated a large part of his speech to Hezbollah and Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated by Israel in Beirut last Friday.
     
            He also praised Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and described it as “legitimate.”
     
            The second part of his sermon was delivered in Arabic, to appeal to Lebanese and Palestinian audiences, he said. “Israel will never defeat Hamas and Hezbollah,” Khamenei said.
     
        “The people of Palestine have the right — in the face of the enemy who has taken over their land, their home, their farms and impacted their life — to stand up for themselves,” he said.
     
 
Remember: Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel on Tuesday in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others.
     
            In late September, as Israel’s nearly year-long war widened and its credit rating was downgraded yet again, the country’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that, while Israel’s economy was under strain, it was resilient.
     
            “Israel’s economy bears the burden of the longest and most expensive war in the country’s history,” Smotrich said on September 28, a day after Israeli airstrikes killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon’s capital Beirut, ratcheting fears that tensions with the militant group would turn into a full-blown conflict.
     
            “The Israeli economy is a strong economy that even today attracts investments.”
     
            Almost a year after Hamas’ deadly attack on October 7, Israel is pushing forward on multiple fronts: launching a ground incursion against Hezbollah in Lebanon, carrying out airstrikes in Gaza and Beirut, and threatening retaliation for Iran’s ballistic missile attack earlier this week.
     
             As the conflict spills over into the wider region, the economic costs will spiral too, both for Israel and other countries in the Middle East.

            Israeli police reported heavy damage in northern Israel following a Hezbollah rocket barrage on Friday.
     
            Earlier on Friday, the Israeli military said nearly two dozen projectiles were identified crossing into Israeli territory from Lebanon.
     
            Police officials said they had received reports about several areas impacted by rocket fire across Kiryat Shmona and the Lower Galilee, with heavy damage reported.
     
            Several fires broke out but no injuries were reported.
     
            Police officers and bomb disposal teams were at the scenes of the strikes.
     
            Firefighting teams were working to extinguish a fire that broke out after a direct hit on a garage in Kiryat Shmona, according to a statement from the Fire and Rescue Services.
     
        “Firefighters are operating to extinguish the fire which broke out on scene, preventing the fire’s expansion to nearby buildings and searching for injured people,” the statement said.
     
 
            The strikes followed warning sirens in Kiryat Shmona and nearby communities.
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted Kiryat Shmona with a rocket barrage “in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli assaults on cities, villages, and civilians.”
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is leading a rare Friday prayer sermon in Tehran to commemorate the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            The last time Khamenei led Friday prayers was nearly five years ago to commemorate the death of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed by the US in an airstrike at Baghdad International Airport.
     
            On Tuesday, Khamenei ordered a missile attack on Israel, partly in response to Nasrallah’s killing in an Israeli airstrike last Friday.
     
            Thousands of people gathered at Tehran’s Grand Mosque for the sermon. A large poster of Nasrallah stood among the worshippers with crowds waving Lebanese and Palestinian flags. State television showed women and men chanting, with some people waving Hezbollah flags and holding posters of both Nasrallah and Soleimani.
     
            The Lebanese army said its personnel responded after one of its soldiers was killed by an Israeli attack on a military facility in southern Lebanon on Thursday.
     
            The soldier was killed “as a result of the Israeli enemy targeting an army center in the Bint Jbeil area - South, and the post personnel responded to the sources of fire,” the Lebanese Armed Forces said Friday.
     
            CNN has contacted the Israeli military for comment.
     
            Another Lebanese soldier was killed in a separate incident Thursday while carrying out a rescue and evacuation mission with the country’s Red Cross, according to the army.
     
            Thousands of people have gathered at Tehran’s Grand Mosque ahead of a Friday prayer service due to be led by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to visuals broadcast by state media outlet IRIB.
     
            Khamenei is also expected to lead a commemoration service for slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last Friday.
     
            Ahead of the service, a number of speakers recited prayers and poetry, with some describing Nasrallah’s death as martyrdom, an act deemed holy in Islam.
     
            Several Lebanese and Palestinian flags could be seen in the crowd.
     
            Khamenei last led Friday prayers in January 2020 after Iran fired missiles at a US army base in Iraq in response to the US assassination of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.
     
            Israel’s military ordered residents of more than 30 villages in southern Lebanon to leave their homes and move north on Friday as it battles Hezbollah fighters in a cross-border ground incursion.
     
            Some of the villages listed in the new order had been included in previous Israeli warnings to move north.
     
            “For your safety, evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Al-Awali River. Save your lives,” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X.
     
        “Anyone near Hezbollah members, facilities, or military equipment is putting their life at risk. Any house used by Hezbollah for its military needs is likely to be targeted.”
     
 
            The Israeli military would notify residents when it was safe to return to their homes, Adraee added.
     
            About 1 million displaced people in Lebanon have sought shelter from the fighting.
     
            Nearly half of the people in Lebanon’s emergency shelters for displaced people are children, and the facilities are operating beyond capacity, Michael Adams, the Lebanon country director at humanitarian agency CARE International, told CNN on Thursday.
     
            Iran’s foreign minister has arrived in Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s official National News Agency.
     
        “At this moment, an Iranian plane has arrived at Rafic Hariri International Airport, carrying Foreign Minister Dr. Abbas Araghchi,” NNA reported on Friday.
     
 
            The visit comes at a time of spiraling regional tensions, with Israel launching sustained attacks in Lebanon over the past week and a recent Iranian missile strike on military targets in Israel.
     
            The Israeli military said nearly two dozen projectiles were identified crossing into Israeli territory from Lebanon after sirens sounded in the northern city of Haifa and the Galilee region.
     
            Reuters video showed rockets being intercepted by Israel’s defense systems over the Haifa skyline around sunrise Friday morning.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said about 20 projectiles were identified after sirens sounded between 7:01 a.m. and 7:04 a.m. local time in the Haifa Bay and Western Galilee areas. Most were intercepted and “the rest fell in open areas,” it said.
     
            Israel Police said some interception shrapnel fell in the area, mostly in Kiryat Yam, just north of Haifa. Property was damaged, but no injuries reported.
     
            “Multiple projectiles” were also identified crossing from Lebanon after sirens sounded at 7:23 a.m. local time in the Upper Galilee area, the military said.
     
            “Some of the projectiles were successfully intercepted and the rest fell in open areas,” it said.
     
            The extent of the impact is unclear.
     
            An Israeli airstrike near the main Lebanon-Syria border crossing has halted traffic in both directions, a Lebanese official said.
     
            The strike destroyed the road leading to the Masnaa crossing with Syria, Public Works Minister Ali Hamie told CNN on Friday, adding the checkpoint “has been cut off.”
     
            CNN has contacted the Israeli military for comment on the strike.
     
            The Masnaa border crossing lies in the Beqaa valley on the Beirut-Damascus international highway, a major transport link for people and goods between the two countries. The highway has been used by tens of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardment in recent days.
     
            On Thursday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said about 160,000 people had crossed the border from Lebanon to Syria since the escalation of hostilities.
     
            Israel struck the Masnaa crossing area in its last all-out war with Hezbollah in 2006.
     
            The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had rescued a 21-year-old Yazidi woman who had been held captive by Hamas in Gaza for more than a decade after being trafficked by ISIS, in a “complex operation” coordinated with the United States and other international actors.
     
            The woman, Fawzia Amin Sido, told CNN that she was kidnapped by ISIS as a child in August 2014, when the group captured the city of Sinjar in northern Iraq. ISIS executed Yazidi men and boys and committed acts of sexual violence and rape against women and girls, among other crimes, as CNN has reported.
     
            Sido said she was then trafficked to different locations across several countries over the next few years.
     
        “We ended up in Al-Hol camp [in Syria] before we were smuggled to Idlib in 2019, and from there, we went to Turkey. In 2020, they arranged a passport for me in Turkey so I could fly from Istanbul to Hurghada, Egypt, and then to Gaza,” she said.
     
 
            She told CNN that she stayed in Rafah in southern Gaza for a year, where life was “unbearable,” moving around frequently since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October 2023 until Tuesday, when she said an NGO rescued her.
     
            “Hamas constantly harassed me due to my Yazidi background and contact with my family, even going so far as to format my phone during their investigations,” she said.
     
        “In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, she was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Thursday.
     
 
            “Upon her entry into Israel, she continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there- returned to her family in Iraq.”
     
            The IDF said her captor was killed, “presumably during IDF strikes” in Gaza, allowing her to flee to a hideout.
     
            Fawzia did not mention a strike when she spoke to CNN, saying only that she was rescued in Rafah by an NGO, which she couldn’t recall the name of. “From there, American officials took me and helped return me to Baghdad,” she said.
     
            The United States and Iraq confirmed they had coordinated to help evacuate Sido out of Gaza.
     
            “We were contacted by the Iraqi government, who was made aware of the fact that she escaped, that she was alive, and that she wanted to come home to her family, ” State spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday.
     
        “The government of Iraq asked us to do whatever we could to get her out of Gaza and get her home. So over the past few weeks, we worked with a number of our partners in the region to get her out of Gaza,” Miller said.
     
 
            Iraq’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sido was freed after more than four months of efforts from Iraqi government agencies working with American and Jordanian authorities.
     
            An Israeli diplomat, David Saranga, released a video of Sido reuniting with her family members. Saranga said her captor was “a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member.”
     
        “Her story is a reminder of the brutality faced by Yazidi children, taken without a choice,” Saranga wrote.
     
 
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is expected to lead a commemoration service for slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as part of Friday prayers in Tehran, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency.
     
            Nasrallah was killed a week ago in an Israeli strike on the militant group’s underground headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
     
            A senior commander from Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Abbas Nilforoushan, was killed alongside Nasrallah and other Hezbollah commanders. His death will also be marked at Friday’s prayers.
     
            Khamenei last led Friday prayers in January 2020 after Iran fired missiles at a US army base in Iraq, in response to a strike that killed revered Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.
     
            The ceremony is scheduled to begin on Friday morning local time (2.30 a.m. ET), at the Grand Mosque in Tehran.
     
            Dozens of medical workers were killed over a 24-hour period in Lebanon, the head of the United Nations’ health agency said Thursday, as he outlined the “difficult and dangerous” conditions in parts of the country under Israeli bombardment.
     
            World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 37 health facilities had closed in southern Lebanon and several Beirut hospitals had evacuated staff and patients, with health and humanitarian workers struggling to provide care with limited supplies.
     
        “Health care continues to come under attack,” he said at a briefing in Geneva. “In Lebanon alone, 28 health workers have been killed in the last 24 hours.”
     
 
            Many health workers were not reporting for duty after being displaced by ongoing Israeli strikes, “severely limiting the provision of mass trauma management and continuity of health services,” Tedros said.
     
            A near-shutdown at Beirut’s airport had also prevented the WHO from delivering a large shipment of trauma and medical supplies to Lebanon on Friday, he added.
     
            WHO’s representative in Lebanon, Abdunasir Abubakar, joined the briefing from Beirut and warned that much of the country’s health infrastructure was nearing its limit.
     
            Though most hospitals were still functioning as they dealt with mass casualties, “the question is how long they can function if… the escalation continues,” he said.
     
            On Thursday, Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said 40 ambulance and firefighting staff had been killed in the previous three days.
     
            Abiad said 97 paramedics and firefighters in the country had been killed by Israeli strikes since October 8 last year, as the death toll across the country during the same period climbed to 1,974, including 261 women and 127 children.
     
            Overnight, seven medics working for the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority were killed by an Israeli strike on central Beirut.
     
            Israeli strikes in Beirut overnight targeted Hashem Safieddine, a potential successor to late Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, an Israeli official told CNN. It’s unclear if he was killed.
     
            Israel’s aerial campaign in Lebanon is being conducted at an intensity comparable only to the first weeks of its bombardment in Gaza last year, an air warfare expert told CNN.
     
            Israel’s escalated offensive in Lebanon has killed over 1,300 people since it began on September 17, according to a CNN tally.
     
            A million people have been displaced in less than three weeks of Israel’s campaign, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. One humanitarian agency said Lebanon’s shelters were overflowing.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            Israel accused Hezbollah of launching approximately 230 projectiles from Lebanon into Israeli territory on Thursday.
     
            Hezbollah, meanwhile, claimed to have carried out 32 varied attacks throughout the day, including rocket salvos on Israeli settlements and military bases and attacks on Israeli soldiers carrying out ground operations in southern Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah was not the only Iran-backed group to have claimed to have attacked Israel on Thursday. In a separate incident, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of several Iran-backed militias, claimed responsibility for a drone attack in southern Israel.
     
            The Israeli military said it intercepted a drone over southern Israel and no one was injured.
     
            Israel’s military ordered residents to evacuate areas around two buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs and stay at least 500 meters away, warning that it would soon target the sites.
     
            One of the evacuation areas includes the Sainte Therese Hospital, which is within a 500 meter radius of one of the target buildings.
     
            CNN attempted to call the hospital.
     
            One evacuation order was issued at 12:48 a.m. local time. The other was published at 1:27 a.m.
     
            An Israeli airstrike Thursday night killed the leader of the Hamas network in the Tulkarem area in the West Bank, the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
            The IDF alleged that Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi planned and led a car bombing in Ateret, an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, and took part in other attacks against Israelis in the West Bank
     
            Other local Hamas operatives were also killed in Thursday’s strike, the IDF said.
     
            Hamas condemned the attack, but did not confirm if Oufi was killed.
     
            The Israeli strikes in Beirut late Thursday into early Friday local time targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            Safieddine is one of the possible successors of late Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike last week.
     
            It is unclear if the strike killed Safieddine.
     
            The US does not believe Israel has made a decision on how to respond to Iran’s ballistic missile attack, according to an official familiar with the matter.
     
            Israeli and American officials continue to discuss a response to Tuesday’s attack, but so far it is the United States’ understanding that Israel is still determining how to proceed, the official said.
     
Biden said earlier Thursday there were discussions about hitting Iranian oil reserves but stopped short of endorsing that option.
     
        “We’re in discussions of that. I think that would be a little — anyway …” he said before being asked a separate, unrelated question. “There’s nothing going to happen today, we’ll talk about that later.”
     
 
            The open-ended comments about targeting Iranian oil nonetheless prompted a spike in the price of oil as markets anticipated an attack on Iranian energy.
     
            The official cautioned against speculation on what Israel might decide to hit, including oil facilities, because its leaders hadn’t yet decided on a course of action.
     
            The United States and Israel have had discussions about what comes after Israel’s incursions in Lebanon, but it’s not clear how long the military actions on the ground will last, according to the State Department.
     
        “I’m not going to prejudge what’s going to happen. We don’t know what’s going to happen. Dare I say, the Israelis probably don’t know what’s going to happen at this point,” said Matt Miller, State Department spokesperson. “We’re going to watch as this unfolds, and we’ll make our assessments in real time.”
     
 
            Miller would not say if the Israelis have an end game for the conflict in the north, as they ramp up cross-border incursions and Beirut strikes against Hezbollah.
     
            “The Israelis will have to speak to that question, not me,” he said.
     
            Despite Miller’s vague answers when it comes to any clarity US officials have received about Israel’s military operations against Hezbollah, the spokesperson said for now, the US is fully supportive of Israel’s efforts to target Hezbollah with “targeted objectives” aimed at the militant group’s infrastructure.
     
            “We want to see a diplomatic resolution, but we do want to see Hezbollah’s capabilities degraded,” Miller said.

            The Middle East is bracing for Israel’s response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack earlier this week. Meantime, Israel is continuing its heavy aerial bombardment and ground incursion in Lebanon.
     
            At least 37 people were killed and 151 were injured by Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Thursday, the Lebanese health ministry said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has pledged to continue to strike Hezbollah targets in Beirut, the Bekaa valley and southern Lebanon.
     
            Since this afternoon, local time, about 100 projectiles have been launched from Lebanon into Israel, the Israeli military said.
     
Here are the top headlines:
 
            Israel’s military ordered residents to evacuate areas around two buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs and stay at least 500 meters away, warning that it would soon target the sites.
     
            One of the evacuation areas includes the Sainte Therese Hospital, which is within a 500 meter radius of one of the target buildings.
     
            CNN is attempting to call the hospital.
     
            One evacuation order was issued at 12:48 a.m. local time. The other was published at 1:27 a.m.
     
            An Israeli airstrike Thursday night killed the leader of the Hamas network in the Tulkarem area in the West Bank, the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
            The IDF alleged that Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi planned and led a car bombing in Ateret, an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, and took part in other attacks against Israelis in the West Bank
     
            Other local Hamas operatives were also killed in Thursday’s strike, the IDF said.
     
            Hamas condemned the attack, but did not confirm if Oufi was killed.
     
            The Israeli strikes in Beirut late Thursday into early Friday local time targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            Safieddine is one of the possible successors of late Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike last week.
     
            It is unclear if the strike killed Safieddine.
     
            The husband of one of the seven people killed in a shooting and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday has described the agonizing search for his wife and baby while Iranian missiles rained down on the city.
     
        “I just went house to house, shouting to Inbar, shouting if someone saw a mother with a baby boy with a carrier … while the missiles were in the air, so I heard the alarms, I saw the missiles and I just keep going and going,” Yeari Vigder told CNN’s Jim Sciutto.
     
 
            His wife, Inbar Segev-Vigder, a 30-year-old fitness instructor, was traveling by light rail to her home in Tel Aviv’s Jaffa neigborhood on Tuesday evening when two men began stabbing and shooting people on the train and in the street.
     
            According Yeari Vigder, his wife was carrying their 9-month-old baby boy in a carrier when she was shot at close range.
     
            When he arrived at the scene of the attack to search for his wife, Vigder found their family’s dog, who was shot, but his wife and son were nowhere to be seen.
     
            As the barrage of some 200 Iranian missiles began to streak the sky over his head, Vigder frantically searched for his family on the bloodstained streets around the light rail station.
     
            He eventually found his son, Ari, in a nearby children’s hospital where he was being looked after by doctors in an underground safety room.
     
            “Ari has no scratch on his body,” Vigder said. “It’s amazing, it’s our little miracle in this whole story.”
     
            He said his wife “was everything for us. We loved her so much. We still love her.”
     
            Sixteen people were also wounded in the attack on Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, according to Israeli Police. The incident happened just minutes before Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, its largest-ever such attack, sending sirens blaring across the country and residents running to bomb shelters.
     
            Israeli authorities identified the gunmen as Muhammad Mask, 19, who was killed at the scene, and Ahmed Himoni, 25, who was severely injured. Police said the pair were residents of Hebron, a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank. Hamas later claimed responsibility for the attack.
     
            At least 37 people were killed and 151 were injured by Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Thursday, the Lebanese health ministry said.
     
            This included nine deaths and 24 injuries in Beirut, where multiple strikes were carried out overnight, including one in the center of the city.
     
            At least 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on the Tulkarem refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said, updating the previous death toll that stood at 16.
     
            The office of the Palestinian Authority’s prime minister condemned the strike, calling it a “heinous crime,” and demanded urgent action from the international community to stop Israel’s attacks.
     
            “It is high time for the international community to put an end to these ongoing crimes, which have no parallel in contemporary history,” the office said in a statement.
     
            The US does not believe Israel has made a decision on how to respond to Iran’s ballistic missile attack, according to an official familiar with the matter.
     
            Israeli and American officials continue to discuss a response to Tuesday’s attack, but so far it is the United States’ understanding that Israel is still determining how to proceed, the official said.
     
Biden said earlier Thursday there were discussions about hitting Iranian oil reserves but stopped short of endorsing that option.
     
        “We’re in discussions of that. I think that would be a little — anyway …” he said before being asked a separate, unrelated question. “There’s nothing going to happen today, we’ll talk about that later.”
     
 
            The open-ended comments about targeting Iranian oil nonetheless prompted a spike in the price of oil as markets anticipated an attack on Iranian energy.
     
            The official cautioned against speculation on what Israel might decide to hit, including oil facilities, because its leaders hadn’t yet decided on a course of action.
     
            A CNN team heard several explosions in Beirut around midnight local time.
     
            Footage on Reuters showed a huge fireball followed by a large plume of smoke rising over the southern suburbs of Beirut.
     
            This comes after the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning to residents of several specified buildings in the southern Beirut suburb of Bourj el Barajneh.
     
            The Israeli military has issued an evacuation warning to residents of several specified buildings in the southern Beirut suburb of Bourj el Barajneh.
     
            In a warning posted shortly before 4 p.m. ET, residents were warned they were “located near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah,” which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will soon target.
     
            The IDF Arabic spokesperson told civilians to evacuate their residences “immediately” and stay at least less than 500 meters away.
     
            Bourj el Barajneh is a densely populated area that includes a Palestinian refugee camp and where many poorer migrants live.
     
            The United States and Israel have had discussions about what comes after Israel’s incursions in Lebanon, but it’s not clear how long the military actions on the ground will last, according to the State Department.
     
        “I’m not going to prejudge what’s going to happen. We don’t know what’s going to happen. Dare I say, the Israelis probably don’t know what’s going to happen at this point,” said Matt Miller, State Department spokesperson. “We’re going to watch as this unfolds, and we’ll make our assessments in real time.”
     
 
            Miller would not say if the Israelis have an end game for the conflict in the north, as they ramp up cross-border incursions and Beirut strikes against Hezbollah.
     
            “The Israelis will have to speak to that question, not me,” he said.
     
            Despite Miller’s vague answers when it comes to any clarity US officials have received about Israel’s military operations against Hezbollah, the spokesperson said for now, the US is fully supportive of Israel’s efforts to target Hezbollah with “targeted objectives” aimed at the militant group’s infrastructure.
     
            “We want to see a diplomatic resolution, but we do want to see Hezbollah’s capabilities degraded,” Miller said.
     
            At least 16 people were killed in an Israeli strike on the Tulkarem refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said Thursday night.
     
            A video obtained by CNN shows bodies hanging from a damaged structure moments after the strike. Other videos show ambulances evacuating victims from the camp and residents carrying wounded people to a hospital.
     
            Israel confirmed that its air force carried out the strike, saying details of the operation would follow.
     
            The US State Department said it is looking to clarify whether Michigan doctor Kamel Ahmad Jawad, who was killed in Lebanon on Tuesday, was an American citizen. Spokesperson Matthew Miller called him a legal permanent resident on Wednesday, but said in a briefing Thursday that “either way, he’s an American, and his death was a horrific tragedy.”
     
            “We offer our sincerest condolences to his family,” Miller said.
     
            Miller said the department “could not verify that he was a US citizen,” adding, “I see now that the family has described him as a US citizen. That may very well be true. We are looking through our records now to verify whether he was an American citizen.”
     
            Jawad was killed Tuesday “after being hit by an Israeli airstrike while trying to save innocent lives in his hometown of Nabatieh, Lebanon,” his family said in a statement.
     
        “In his last days, he chose to stay near the main hospital in Nabatieh to help the elderly, disabled, injured, and those who simply couldn’t financially afford to flee,” his daughter said in a statement shared on Instagram.
     
 
            “He served as their guardian, provided them with food, mattresses, and other comforts, and anonymously paid off their debts. I would often ask him if he was scared, and he repeatedly told me that we should not be scared because he is doing what he loves the most: helping others live in the land he loved the most,” the statement said.
     
            The Israeli military said it is going to continue striking Hezbollah targets in Beirut, the Bekaa valley and southern Lebanon.
     
            Herzi Halevi, the chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, said in a video message Thursday that the military is “determined to destroy” Hezbollah infrastructure near the Lebanese border and will continue to inflict damage against the militant group.
     
            Halevi said returning residents near the border to their homes “means destroying the terrorist infrastructure that Hezbollah has built near the border so they could raid our communities and kill Israeli civilians when given the order.”
     
        “We are very determined to destroy this infrastructure and eliminate anyone present there. We will not allow Hezbollah to establish itself in these places,” the military chief said.
     
 
            Israel has accused Hezbollah of embedding weapons facilities beneath residential buildings in Beirut, while Israeli political leaders have become increasingly defiant of international calls for restraint and outrage over growing civilian casualties in Lebanon and Gaza.
     
            Halevi said in his video message that Israeli troops “are more prepared and trained than ever, bearing the experience from the operations in Gaza, and their advantage in the combat arena is clear.”
     
            Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Tuesday destroyed at least three buildings at the Netavim Air Base in southern Israel and left at least a dozen craters, a CNN analysis of satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows.
     
            Iran’s military chief Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri said that the base — located in the remote Negev desert in Israel — was targeted, along with another air base and the headquarters of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.
     
            Videos geolocated by CNN show a number of explosions at the airbase during the attack. Missiles tore large holes in the roofs of two hangars used to store larger planes. Debris from the structures, splintered by the missile, are scattered on the ground around the hangars.
     
            Right next to the hangars, two additional craters are seen in a taxiway of the base. Satellite imagery shows that a portion of the taxiway hit by the missiles is being actively being excavated and repaired.
     
            Iran also appeared to have targeted other hangars at the base. Two missiles just missed a group of hangars, which are likely used for storing fighter jets, by about 40 feet, based on where the craters are.
     
            A third building just north of the hangars was also hit. It’s unclear what that building was used for, but it was not used to store aircraft.
     
            Taxiways, a runway and other roadways at the base were also hit. The southernmost runway and a nearby taxiway both have craters of almost 30 feet.
     
            About 250 Americans and their family members have now departed Lebanon on two US-organized flights this week, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday.
     
            The second flight departed Beirut on Thursday morning, carrying 134 passengers, Miller said. Both that flight and the flight on Wednesday went on to Istanbul, Miller said.
     
        “We’re going to continue to organize those flights as long as the security situation is challenging, as long as there aren’t sufficient commercial options available, and as long as there’s demand,” he said at a news briefing.
     
 
            In addition, the US has worked with Middle East Airlines to increase the number of seats set aside for US citizens.
     
            “In the past week, we have made over 1,400 seats on available on flights out of Lebanon, and many seats do remain available,” Miller said Thursday.
     
            Miller acknowledged that the price on those commercial flights is high, which is part of why the US has organized its own flights.
     
        “The most that any American will pay on those flights is $283. And if they can’t afford $283, they don’t have $283, we will provide them a loan from the US government for the cost of that ticket on board one of the flights that we have organized,” Miller said.
     
 
            Israel’s offensive in Lebanon is “destroying the country,” Lebanese Economy Minister Amin Salam told CNN.
     
            Salam condemned Thursday morning’s strike on central Beirut, the first in that part of the city since 2006, highlighting how Israel is striking increasingly close to civilian areas.
     
        “This has gone far and beyond what happened in 2006,” Salam told CNN’s Eleni Giokos, pointing out that the strike was carried out less than two miles from the Government Palace.
     
 
            Salam warned that the displacement of over 1 million Lebanese and Syrian people from Lebanon will be a “long-term issue” for the government to manage, even if a ceasefire went into effect.
     
        “We have hospitals filled with people, schools filled with people, people sleeping on the street, and this war keeps going. The way I see it is that this war has no goal. It’s just destroying the country,” Salam said.
     
 
            “We need to rebuild their towns, their villages. We need to provide peaceful conditions for them. So, we are really in a very complicated operation now to take care of all those people,” the minister added.
     
            Nearly half of the people in Lebanon’s emergency shelters are children and the facilities are operating beyond capacity, according to the Lebanon county director of a humanitarian agency.
     
        “Already the shelters that have been assigned by the government of Lebanon are full and overflowing,” Michael Adams of CARE International told CNN on Thursday.
     
 
            “About 47% of the people that are in these shelters are children,” Adams said, who is based in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. Women and girls have been disproportionately affected by the displacement caused by the airstrikes, he said.
     
            Aid workers have been attempting to find people shelter and assist with injuries from Israel’s aerial campaign, while also providing them with food and supplies, Adams added. He said his agency is seeing thousands fleeing various neighborhoods, looking for safety.
     
            “The city is well equipped but not equipped enough for the number of people that are injured. Supermarkets do have some supplies but they are running out very quickly,” particularly in southern Lebanon, Adams said.
     
            An Israeli military officer was killed in combat in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
            The IDF identified the soldier as Ben Zion Falach. He is the ninth Israeli soldier to have been killed since Israel launched its ground offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon this week.
     
            Falach, 21, was an officer in the 202nd Battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade, the IDF said in a statement.
     
            Israel’s military says it killed several Hezbollah commanders in a strike on a military structure in southern Lebanon.
     
            The commanders of the combat area, engineering forces and fire coordination were among those killed, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.
     
            The strike was carried out during a joint operation between the Israeli Air Force and the Golani Brigade, which has been conducting ground raids in southern Lebanon over the past day, it added.
     
            The IDF also said it destroyed another military structure in a different strike and seized weapons and other equipment during the raids.
     
            About 100 projectiles have been launched from Lebanon into Israel in the last several hours, the Israeli military said.
     
            According to the Israel Defense Forces, the launches have been happening since 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET).
     
            Most were directed at the town of Metula along the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            A CNN team in Beirut heard loud blasts on Thursday evening local time and saw smoke rising over Beirut’s southern suburbs.
     
            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum says it will not hold its weekly rallies in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday, two days before the anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks of October 7, 2023.
     
            The forum said the decision was made in light of the “security situation” in the region.
     
            But dozens of rallies are still set to take place this Saturday in other locations.
     
            “The families of the hostages urge the public to continue supporting the struggle and to join the rally in Carmei Gat or Sha’ar HaNegev, or at protest points throughout the country,” the forum said.
     
            The rallies have been held regularly throughout the year, with demonstrators calling for the return of hostages in Gaza through a negotiated deal.
     
            Around 160,000 people have crossed the border from Lebanon to Syria since the escalation of hostilities in Lebanon last month, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Thursday.
     
            The rate of those crossing into Syria slowed on Wednesday after a steady stream of arrivals since Israel launched its air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon on September 23, UNHCR said in an update.
     
            UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh previously told CNN on Monday that around 100,000 people had crossed the border.
     
            Of the thousands now believed to have made the journey, about 70% — around 112,000 people — are Syrians. The remainder are Lebanese nationals.
     
            The vast majority of people are leaving Lebanon in the east, toward the Syrian capital of Damascus.
     
            As Israel’s strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon continue, elsewhere, the Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported 99 new deaths and 169 injuries in the past 24 hours due to Israeli airstrikes on the territory.
     
            With today’s numbers, the total death toll since October 7 of last year has risen to 41,788, with 96,794 injured, the ministry said in a Thursday statement.
     
            Additionally, it noted that many victims remain trapped under rubble, with emergency teams unable to reach them. The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian deaths.
     
For context: Since October 8, 2023, the day after Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, there has been regular cross-border fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military, prior to the latest escalation. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks.
     
            Israel’s aerial campaign in Lebanon is being conducted at an intensity comparable only to the first weeks of its bombardment in Gaza last year, an air warfare expert told CNN.
     
            Emily Tripp, the director of the UK-based aerial warfare monitoring group Airwars, told CNN’s Eleni Giokos that both the Lebanon and Gaza campaigns are occurring at “a level and intensity that Israel’s own allies just simply would not have carried out in the last 20 years.”
     
            “It’s only really comparable to those first weeks in Gaza,” Tripp said of the campaign in Lebanon.
     
            “The reality is war is messy and complicated and militants embed themselves in civilian neighborhoods that inherently endangers civilians. This is not an easy operating environment,” Tripp added.
     
        “We’re no longer in a situation where the front lines are easily distinguishable, particularly in civilian populations. But that doesn’t mean that civilian protection and measures to protect civilians should go out the window.
     
 
            “I think it’s quite easy to blame a fog of war and say that this is just a very complicated environment, but it’s not,” Tripp said.
     
            US President Joe Biden fielded questions on the ongoing Middle East conflict before departing the White House for Florida and Georgia Thursday.
     
            Asked if he would support Israel striking Iran’s oil reserves in retaliation for the massive Tuesday missile strike against Israel, Biden left the door open, telling reporters, “We’re in discussions of that” but “there’s nothing going to happen today; we’ll talk about that later.”
     
            Yesterday, Biden made clear he does not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites.
     
            The president declined to outline what sanctions the US is considering against Iran, telling one reporter, “I’ll tell them before I tell you.”
     
            He added that there was no update to share on the hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza.
     
            Forty ambulance and firefighting staff have been killed in the past three days across Lebanon, Health Minister Firass Abiad said Thursday.
     
            Abiad said 97 paramedics and firefighters in the country have been killed by Israeli strikes since October 8 last year, as the death toll across the country from the same date climbed to 1,974, of whom 127 are children and 261 are women.
     
            Overnight, seven medics working for Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority were killed by an Israeli strike on central Beirut.
     
            “We know that there are international laws protecting medical institutions, ambulances and health care workers,” the health minister said.
     
            Israel’s military says its air force struck Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters in Beirut on Thursday.
     
            “The Intelligence Corps is Hezbollah’s primary intelligence body and is responsible for aggregating intelligence about the IDF and the State of Israel,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.
     
            Earlier, Hezbollah told reporters its media office was targeted in strikes in southern Beirut.
     
            Three Israeli airstrikes struck the southern suburbs of Beirut Thursday afternoon local time, “one of which targeted (the neighborhood of) Haret Hreik,” Lebanese state media NNA reports.
     
            Hezbollah announced shortly after the blasts that its media office was targeted, on a WhatsApp group it shares with reporters.
     
            Several large blasts were heard by CNN teams in west Beirut.
     
            CNN teams there saw large plumes of smoke rising from the southern suburbs of the city, and are hearing the sound of drones in the skies overhead.
     
This post has been updated with additional details.
 
            Former National Security Adviser John Bolton — who has called for Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear weapons program in the wake of Iran’s ballistic missile attacks this week — criticized President Joe Biden for urging Israel to exercise restraint in retaliating against the attack.
     
        “Even if that’s his opinion, why do you tell Israel’s adversary, and by the way, America’s adversary in Tehran, what you’re not going to do?, ” Bolton told Kasie Hunt on CNN This Morning of Biden saying Israel should respond to Iran’s attacks proportionately. “Let them worry about it.”
     
 
            Bolton added that Biden’s “position itself is wrong” and argued that Israel must respond “disproportionately” to actually deter Iran by targeting its nuclear proliferation program.
     
            “I think the administration is paralyzed by this fear of wider war … the wider war is already here,” he added.
     
            Bolton continued, “Can you assure Israel that the next time Iran fires a ballistic missile from its territory, that under the nose cone of that missile there’s not going to be a nuclear weapon? … Is the threat of nuclear extinction a bigger or a smaller threat than a wider war?”
     
            A Lebanese soldier was killed while carrying out a rescue and evacuation mission with the country’s Red Cross on Thursday, the Lebanese army said.
     
            The soldier was killed and another was injured during the operation in the southern town of Taybeh.
     
        “(A) soldier was martyred and another injured as a result of an attack by the Israeli enemy while carrying out an evacuation and rescue mission in cooperation with the Lebanese Red Cross in the town of Taybeh – Marjayoun,” the Lebanese Armed Forces said on X.
     
 
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued evacuation orders for an additional 25 villages in southern Lebanon, signaling a broadening of its ground incursion in the country.
     
            A total of 76 villages in southern Lebanon have now been issued IDF evacuation notices since Tuesday.
     
            IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee listed the names of the 25 new villages Thursday, which are in areas that now extend deeper into Lebanon, reaching up to 45 kilometers (28 miles) inside the country.
     
            He warned Lebanese citizens “for your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali River.”
     
            “Save your lives,” he added.
     
            On Wednesday, the IDF announced it was sending an additional division to participate in its ground war in Lebanon, having reiterated that the campaign is “limited, localized, targeted.”
     
            Hezbollah says it repelled an attempt by Israeli forces to advance at the Lebanese border on Thursday, where the two sides have been clashing since Israel launched a ground attack.
     
            The militant group said they stopped an attempted advance by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at the Fatima Gate border crossing by firing artillery at advancing soldiers. They also said they halted an Israeli attack near the town of Maroun Al-Ras.
     
            Hezbollah also announced it had fired more rockets on Israel, targeting an Israeli settlement in the country’s north as well as a military outpost, saying the attacks were in support of Palestinians in Gaza and “in response to the brutal Israeli aggression.”
     
            CNN has approached the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
            The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on central Beirut early Thursday morning has risen to nine, the Lebanese health ministry says.
     
            The strike hit the neighborhood of Bashoura, near the city’s downtown, CNN confirmed, through geolocating the area.
     
            An update from Lebanon’s health ministry later on Thursday said the death toll had risen to nine “martyrs.” In addition, 14 people were injured. DNA tests are underway to determine the identity of some of the remains.
     
            Of the nine killed, seven were medics working for the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority. The authority had an office on one floor of the building which was hit during a wave of strikes on the Lebanese capital. CNN Turk found the building badly damaged, with rubble in the street.
     
            CNN previously reported that at least six people had been killed in the strike.
     
            It marks the first time Israel has struck the area since 2006. Israel’s strikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 1 million residents since it escalated its war with Hezbollah.
     
            At least two people have been reported killed after Israel carried out strikes on several parts of Lebanon overnight, continuing its heaviest bombardment of the country in nearly two decades.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Thursday it struck around 200 Hezbollah targets overnight in Lebanese territory, including on the militant group’s infrastructure sites, weapons storage facilities and observation posts in southern Lebanon.
     
            The IDF said the Israeli Air Force “precisely struck” a municipality building in Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon, which it said Hezbollah militants were operating and where “large quantities of Hezbollah weapons” were stored in the building. It said it killed 15 Hezbollah fighters.
     
            Lebanon’s state-run NNA said two Ethiopian nationals were killed in Israeli strikes on the western coastal district of Tyre; it also said Bint Jbeil was targeted.
     
            More than a dozen airstrikes were also reported on Beirut’s southern suburbs, which was targeted by “aerial aggression” and “hostile warplanes,” NNA said. The Israeli military in recent days has repeatedly bombed the capital’s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.
     
            It comes as about 25 projectiles, and two drones crossed into Israeli territory from Lebanon on Thursday morning, according to the IDF. No injuries were reported, it said.
     
            Families of Israeli hostages in Gaza left empty chairs at the dinner table to highlight their absence as they welcomed the start of the Jewish New Year on Wednesday.
     
            Celebrations for Rosh Hashanah, which began at sunset on Wednesday and ends at nightfall Friday, have been overshadowed this year by the escalation of regional conflict as the first anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel draws nearer.
     
            Images of symbolic empty spaces were posted online by Instagram account @bringthemhome23, which campaigns for the hostages’ release.
     
            Some family members held an open-air banquet Wednesday to mark the holiday and call for the release of their loved ones.
     
            About 100 people kidnapped by Hamas are believed to remain in Gaza, though it is unclear how many are still alive.
     
            Israeli’s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 people in the Palestinian enclave and has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe.
     
            The conflict has widened in recent weeks, as Israel strikes Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and weighs up its response to an unprecedented Iranian missile attack that has brought the region to the precipice of all-out war.
     
            Iran has reopened its airspace to commercial flights after ordering it closed on Tuesday evening following its ballistic missile attack on Israel.
     
        “After ensuring favorable and safe flight conditions and ending the restrictions, airlines are allowed to carry out flight operations from 5 am today,” a spokesperson of the Civil Aviation Organization said, according to a Thursday report from the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
     
 
            The organization had announced late Tuesday that all flights nationwide would be canceled until Wednesday morning, which it later extended until Thursday morning.
     
            Devastating Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon have given Israel the upper hand as it edges toward a direct confrontation with the militant group’s backers in Iran, a regional expert said on Thursday.
     
            After killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and launching a ground incursion in southern Lebanon, Israel was likely to target Iran directly in response to Tuesday’s Iranian missile attack, said Paul Salem, vice president for international engagement at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.
     
        “We are bracing for a large-scale Israeli attack on Iran,” Salem told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade.
     
 
            Israel’s assassination of Nasrallah and multiple heavy hits to Hezbollah over the past two weeks signaled a “tectonic shift” in regional power dynamics, he added.
     
            “Before Israel decapitated Hezbollah and greatly degraded it, Israel used to worry about Hezbollah much more when it contemplated hitting Iran,” Salem said.
     
            “Now, they feel Hezbollah is not a major threat and now Israel is focused on going after Iran itself. And that tectonic shift is a shift in which Iran no longer has the balance of power or balance of deterrence between Iran and Israel.”
     
            Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed to have launched a drone attack on the Tel Aviv area overnight, according to a statement on Thursday.
     
            The Iran-backed militant group claimed it struck a target in the Israeli city, without providing specific information.
     
            Earlier, the Israeli military said it had identified two drones after warning sirens sounded in the coastal city of Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv.
     
            One drone was intercepted by the Israeli air force over the sea and the second fell in an open area, with no injuries reported, the military said.
     
            On Wednesday night, a CNN team in Tel Aviv saw what appeared to be intercepts in the sky over the Mediterranean Sea.
     
            The White House’s ability to control Israel’s military strategy is “quite limited,” a CNN security analyst told CNN, as US officials call for a de-escalation in Israel’s growing conflict with Iran, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            Juliette Kayyem, a national security, intelligence and terrorism analyst, told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade it is difficult to predict Israel’s response at this stage, saying the United States’ influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military strategy had lessened since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.
     
            The United States is Israel’s most important ally and biggest supplier of arms. But its “ability to control Israel in terms of its military strategy is showing itself to be quite limited,” Kayyem said.
     
            Israel’s continuing attacks in Gaza show that concerns from the US on hindrances to  humanitarian aid have gone unheeded by Israeli authorities, she added.
     
            Asked whether Israel would listen to US President Joe Biden’s message that Iranian nuclear sites should not be targeted, Kayyem noted that Israel has vowed to launch a “very public and forceful” response to Iran’s major missile attack and is “keeping its options open.”
     
        “It’s not like there aren’t enough potential targets. It won’t just be nuclear,” Kayyem said. “You could go after oil fields, you could go after their missile sites, but Israel is keeping its options open — one hopes, to avoid a regional, direct conflict between Iran and Israel. The consequences of that [are] just unknowable to anyone at this stage.”
     
 
            Several countries are ramping up efforts to evacuate their nationals from Lebanon and urging those remaining to leave amid the escalating situation as Israel wages a ground offensive in the south of the country.
     
            While no country has launched a large-scale military evacuation yet, some governments have organized charter flights and others have helped secure seats on commercial flights out of Lebanon, with many looking to Cyprus and Turkey as transit points.
     
Here’s a look at what some countries have done:
 
            An Israeli military reservist who survived the Nova festival massacre has been hailed as a “hero” by the country’s security minister for confronting two men behind Tuesday’s shooting and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv.
     
            Seven people were killed and 16 wounded in the attack on Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, a port neighborhood in southern Tel Aviv, according to Israeli Police.
     
            Video posted online showed Lev Kreitman, who served six months as a reservist with the Israeli military in Gaza, firing a gun at an unknown target before running away. The footage was filmed from a nearby building in Jaffa and appears to show Kreitman wearing a pink shirt, white shorts and flip flops.
     
            In another video, Kreitman was seen walking in the background among Israeli soldiers who were at the scene of the attack.
     
            Speaking to CNN affiliate Channel 11, Kreitman said he had been carrying his personal handgun after his time with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            Recalling Tuesday’s incident, he said he had spotted what he described as “two terrorists,” one moving toward him.
     
        “The other goes somewhere else, runs somewhere else, and I’m here, right where we’re standing, I surprised him from the side, shoot,” Kreitman said, adding he understood straight away it was an attack.
     
 
            Police said Wednesday that two gunmen had begun their “killing spree” by opening fire on passengers aboard a light rail car that had stopped at a station in Jaffa. They had then continued their attack on foot on Jerusalem Boulevard, according to police.

            Thousands of people are fleeing Lebanon as Israel carries out its heaviest bombardment of the country since 2006, when Hezbollah and Israel’s military fought a devastating war.
     
            On Wednesday, flights carrying Lebanese citizens escaping the Israeli airstrikes arrived in Cyprus after the Israeli military launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon against Hezbollah.
     
            “It was terrible situation, really terrible situation,” Lebanese national Ali Abdul Hassan told Reuters news agency, after arriving in the capital Larnaca late on Wednesday night.
     
            The 49-year-old said he fled Beirut after an airstrike hit his neighborhood near the capital and left his house seriously damaged. He said a building that was struck had been housing Lebanese families who had already fled southern Lebanon.
     
        “I hope, I hope, (they) should arrive to a deal, (they) should stop the war, it’s not good for anyone,” he added.
     
 
            Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced in the country in recent weeks amid the latest conflict, including more than 100,000 people, mostly Lebanese and Syrians, who have fled across the border into Syria, according to the United Nations.
     
            Israel’s war cabinet is weighing its response after Iran launched its largest-ever attack on the country. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN that retaliation “will be soon.”
     
            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi warned that Israel has the means to “strike any target in the Middle East.”  
 
            While Iran does not seek war, it will deliver a “stronger response” if Israel retaliates, said Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
     
            US President Joe Biden said Israel “has a right to respond. It should be a proportional response.” While he said he did not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites, he noted the US would discuss with the Israelis how they might respond to Iran’s missile attack.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            Israel’s war cabinet is weighing its options and “will not sit idly by” after Iran launched its largest-ever attack on the country, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
     
        “What happened last night was an unprecedented response and as I said today in the Security Council that it will be a very strong, painful response. It will be soon.”
     
        Danon said Wednesday night.
     
            Iran launched a salvo of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets, sending sirens blaring across Israel and activating the country’s sophisticated defense systems.
     
            “I think they know that we have the capabilities to reach any destination in the Middle East and it’s up to us to decide how to do it and what to target.”
     
            Asked whether Israel is heeding US President Joe Biden’s message that Iran’s nuclear site should not be targeted in Israel’s looming response, Danon said: “It should be the responsibility of the US and other Western democracies to block Iran from achieving nuclear capabilities, otherwise it will be too late.”
     
            Danon said Israel doesn’t want to see escalation or war but insisted it will retaliate against Iran’s large-scale rocket launches.
     
        “But we would have to make it a calculated response because we don’t want to see full war with Iran. And believe me, they also don’t want to see it. We have shown our capabilities when we fought Hamas in Gaza, and we are fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. They better look at what happened in Beirut and in Gaza before they start a war with us.”
     
 
            Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a 21-day ceasefire just days before he was assassinated by Israel.
 
            The temporary ceasefire was called for by US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and other allies during last week’s UN General Assembly.
     
            “He [Nasrallah] agreed, he agreed,” Habib told Christiane Amanpour in an interview aired on Wednesday.
     
        “We agreed completely. Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire but consulting with Hezbollah. The [Lebanese House] Speaker Mr. Nabih Berri consulted with Hezbollah and we informed the Americans and the French what happened. And they told us that Mr. [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu also agreed on the statement that was issued by both presidents [Biden and Macron.]”
     
 
            White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein was then set to go to Lebanon to negotiate the ceasefire, Habib continued.
     
            “They told us that Mr. Netanyahu agreed on this and so we also got the agreement of Hezbollah on that and you know what happened since then,” Habib continued.
     
            Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
     
            A day earlier, a joint statement issued by the United States, France, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Qatar called for a 21-day ceasefire, “to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border.”
     
            In response to a question on the United States’ diminishing influence in the region, Habib said Washington was “always important in this regard.”
     
            “I don’t think we have an alternative. We need the United States’ help. Whether we get it or not, we’re not sure yet, but [the] United States is very important, vital for the ceasefire to happen,” said Habib.
     
            Lebanon is appealing for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to address an internal refugee crisis sparked by Israeli military strikes on the country.
     
            The country, gripped by an economic crisis since 2019, says it urgently needs $427 million for United Nations-backed shelter and relief efforts over the next three months after Israeli airstrikes forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.
     
            Speaking after a cabinet meeting Wednesday, Information Minister Ziad Makary said Lebanese officials had discussed a response to the crisis with UN organizations and ambassadors from donor countries.
     
            “All aid will pass through a transparent mechanism via the United Nations, with implementation coordinated with the Lebanese state,” Makary said, according to the state-run National News Agency (NNA).
     
            An estimated 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced in recent weeks, thousands of them sheltering in the capital Beirut, including in schools on the edges of the city’s southern suburbs.
     
        “Currently, around 874 shelters have been established, with increasing numbers of displaced persons, primarily non-Lebanese, seeking refuge,” Makary said. “The government is coordinating with the UN Refugee Agency to provide adequate support, ensuring that no one remains on the streets.”
     
 
            An Israeli airstrike on central Beirut hit a building that housed the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority, a resident of the neighborhood told CNN.
     
            The authority had an office on one floor of the building which was hit during a wave of strikes on the Lebanese capital in the early hours of Thursday morning local time.
     
            A CNN team heard a loud bang followed by a plume of smoke rising from the Bashoura area in Beirut. Video showed families leaving the neighborhood amid the wreckage left behind by the attack. The residential area that was hit is known to be dominated by Hezbollah’s Shia allies, Amal.
     
            It was the first time Israel struck the heart of the capital since the last all-out war between the two countries in 2006.
     
            The death toll from the strike in central Beirut rose to six people when “three of the wounded died from their serious injuries,” the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement.
     
            The ministry said all seven of the wounded are still being treated in the hospitals where they transferred to. The ministry initially reported at least two people were killed and 11 were wounded.
     
            A CNN team in Beirut heard loud explosions and saw smoke rising above central Beirut just after midnight local time on Thursday.
     
            A CNN team in Tel Aviv saw what appeared to be intercepts in the sky over the sea.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it intercepted an aerial target over central Israel.
     
        “A short while ago, the IAF intercepted a suspicious aerial target off the coast of the Dan area in central Israel. No sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol,” the Israel Defense Forces told CNN.
     
 
            A central Beirut neighborhood was hit in a strike in the early hours of Thursday local time, CNN confirmed through geolocating the area.
     
            CNN has verified imagery showing the impact of the strike that hit the Lebanese capital.
     
            In response to the strike in the southern suburbs, the Israeli military said it conducted a precise strike in Beirut. When asked about the strike in central Beirut, the military referred CNN to its previous statement.
     
            The strike hit Beirut’s Bashoura neighborhood, near the city’s downtown.
     
Watch video of the moment the strike hit Beirut’s Bashoura neighborhood:
 
Important context: Israeli strikes in central Beirut are rare. The Thursday morning attack is the first Israeli strike to hit the heart of the capital since the last all-out war between Lebanon and Israel in 2006. Even then, Israel rarely targeted the city center. This is the second strike since 2006 to hit within Beirut city limits, with the first being near Cola intersection early Monday morning local time.
     
            Just before the strike on central Beirut, a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs — a Hezbollah stronghold — destroyed a multi-story building in the residential Haret Hreik neighborhood, images geolocated by CNN appear to show.

            The temporary ceasefire was called for by US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and other allies during last week’s UN General Assembly.
     
            “He [Nasrallah] agreed, he agreed,” Habib told Christiane Amanpour in an interview aired on Wednesday.
     
            “We agreed completely. Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire but consulting with Hezbollah. The [Lebanese House] Speaker Mr. Nabih Berri consulted with Hezbollah and we informed the Americans and the French what happened. And they told us that Mr. [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu also agreed on the statement that was issued by both presidents [Biden and Macron.]”
     
            White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein was then set to go to Lebanon to negotiate the ceasefire, Habib continued.
     
        “They told us that Mr. Netanyahu agreed on this and so we also got the agreement of Hezbollah on that and you know what happened since then,” Habib continued.
     
 
            Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
     
            A day earlier, a joint statement issued by the United States, France, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Qatar called for a 21-day ceasefire, “to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border.”
     
            In response to a question on the United States’ diminishing influence in the region, Habib said Washington was “always important in this regard.”
     
            “I don’t think we have an alternative. We need the United States’ help. Whether we get it or not, we’re not sure yet, but [the] United States is very important, vital for the ceasefire to happen,” said Habib.
     
            Lebanon is appealing for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to address an internal refugee crisis sparked by Israeli military strikes on the country.
     
            The country, gripped by an economic crisis since 2019, says it urgently needs $427 million for United Nations-backed shelter and relief efforts over the next three months after Israeli airstrikes forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.
     
            Speaking after a cabinet meeting Wednesday, Information Minister Ziad Makary said Lebanese officials had discussed a response to the crisis with UN organizations and ambassadors from donor countries.
     
            “All aid will pass through a transparent mechanism via the United Nations, with implementation coordinated with the Lebanese state,” Makary said, according to the state-run National News Agency (NNA).
     
            An estimated 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced in recent weeks, thousands of them sheltering in the capital Beirut, including in schools on the edges of the city’s southern suburbs.
     
            “Currently, around 874 shelters have been established, with increasing numbers of displaced persons, primarily non-Lebanese, seeking refuge,” Makary said. “The government is coordinating with the UN Refugee Agency to provide adequate support, ensuring that no one remains on the streets.”
     
            At least six people were killed early Thursday local time in central Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, after the Israeli military said it conducted a precise strike. When asked about the strike, the military referred CNN to a previous statement.
     
            The airstrike hit a building that housed the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority, a resident of the neighborhood told CNN. The authority had an office on one floor of the building.
     
            Israeli strikes were also reported in Syria, which left three dead, and Gaza, where eight were killed.
     
Here’s what to know:
 
Situation on the ground: A CNN team on the ground heard three loud explosions around 11:40 p.m. local time (4:40 p.m. ET), and saw smoke rising above Beirut’s southern Dahiyeh neighborhood, a Hezbollah stronghold. This comes after the following reported movements: 
 
What Israel has said: Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has sent a stark message regarding a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, warning that Israel has the means to “strike any target in the Middle East.” Here’s what else we’ve heard from Israel today:
     
What Hezbollah has said: Following Iran’s missile attacks against Israel, Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammad Afif made his first public remarks on the developments from amid the rubble of a building struck down by an Israeli airstrike in recent days. “For all those who doubted Iran’s stance after the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh until recent weeks have been smacked in the mouth by a big rock,” Afif said in an impassioned statement. Here’s what else to note: 
 
What Iran has said: Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said while Iran does not seek war, it will deliver a “stronger response” if Israel retaliates following Iran’s missile attack Tuesday. “We were left with no choice but to respond. If Israel wants to react, we will have a stronger response,” Pezeshkian said. Here’s other notable news from Iran:
     
US response: President Joe Biden said he will speak to Netanyahu “relatively soon.” Here’s what the US position is:
     
            Three explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs twenty minutes before midnight. Thick smoke quickly obscured the lights on the mountains above, drifting across the heart of the city.
     
            Another night of air strikes has begun.
     
            Unlike Monday night, there were no warnings posted by the Arabic spokesperson from the Israeli military advising people to leave.
     
            Then forty minutes later, from CNN’s rooftop position in west Beirut, a swoosh and a sharp blast could be heard. This time it wasn’t in what is known as Dahiyeh — the southern suburbs where Hezbollah has a large presence. It was the Bashoura neighborhood in the very heart of Beirut, an area that hasn’t been struck since the war in 2006.
 
            It is just up the street from CNN’s Beirut bureau, a bustling working-class neighborhood next to an old graveyard. It’s an area where some of the population of more than a million people who have fled bombing elsewhere had taken refuge, hoping it might be safe.
     
            It also sits next to what is known as the Ring Road, a four-lane highway linking east and west Beirut.
     
            CNN is receiving reports that the strike sent terrified people into the streets, fleeing the area. The Lebanese Ministry of Health reports a preliminary death toll of six people, with seven wounded.
     
            Then came another loud blast, this time in the southern suburbs. And another blast.
     
            It’s going to be another long night in Beirut.
     
            An Israeli airstrike on central Beirut hit a building that housed the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority, a resident of the neighborhood told CNN.
     
            The authority had an office on one floor of the building which was hit during a wave of strikes on the Lebanese capital in the early hours of Thursday morning local time.
     
            A CNN team heard a loud bang followed by a plume of smoke rising from the Bashoura area in Beirut. Video showed families leaving the neighborhood amid the wreckage left behind by the attack. The residential area that was hit is known to be dominated by Hezbollah’s Shia allies, Amal.
     
            It was the first time Israel struck the heart of the capital since the last all-out war between the two countries in 2006.
     
            The death toll from the strike in central Beirut rose to six people when “three of the wounded died from their serious injuries,” the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement.
     
            The ministry said all seven of the wounded are still being treated in the hospitals where they transferred to. The ministry initially reported at least two people were killed and 11 were wounded.
     
            A CNN team in Beirut heard loud explosions and saw smoke rising above central Beirut just after midnight local time on Thursday.
     
The post was updated to reflect the latest death toll from the strike in central Beirut.
 
            A CNN team in Tel Aviv saw what appeared to be intercepts in the sky over the sea.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed it intercepted an aerial target over central Israel.
     
        “A short while ago, the IAF intercepted a suspicious aerial target off the coast of the Dan area in central Israel. No sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol,” the Israel Defense Forces told CNN.
     
 
This post has been updated with additional information from the Israel Defense Forces.
 
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued new evacuation orders for five buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh.
     
            CNN verified that one building in this area had already been struck earlier on Thursday morning local time, but it was not one of the five buildings the IDF ordered residents to evacuate from.
     
            Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesperson, warned residents that they are located near Hezbollah facilities which the Israeli military will act against “in the near future.”
     
            A central Beirut neighborhood was hit in a strike in the early hours of Thursday local time, CNN confirmed through geolocating the area.
     
            CNN has verified imagery showing the impact of the strike that hit the Lebanese capital.
     
            In response to the strike in the southern suburbs, the Israeli military said it conducted a precise strike in Beirut. When asked about the strike in central Beirut, the military referred CNN to its previous statement.
     
            The strike hit Beirut’s Bachoura neighborhood, near the city’s downtown.
     
Watch video of the moment the strike hit Beirut’s Bachoura neighborhood: 
 
Important context: Israeli strikes in central Beirut are rare. The Thursday morning attack is the first Israeli strike to hit the heart of the capital since the last all-out war between Lebanon and Israel in 2006. Even then, Israel rarely targeted the city center. This is the second strike since 2006 to hit within Beirut city limits, with the first being near Cola bridge early Monday morning local time.
     
            Just before the strike on central Beirut, a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs — a Hezbollah stronghold — destroyed a multi-story building in the residential Haret Hreik neighborhood, images geolocated by CNN appear to show.
     
            A CNN team in Beirut heard loud explosions and saw smoke rising over central Beirut.
     
            Earlier, three explosions were heard and smoke was seen over Beirut’s southern suburbs.
     
            At least 46 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon over the past 24 hours, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            Another 85 have been injured, the ministry said.
     
            The latest death toll comes as the Israeli military said there were 300 launches from Lebanon to Israel on Wednesday.
     
            A CNN team on the ground heard three loud explosions around 11:40 p.m. local time (4:40 p.m. ET), and saw smoke rising above Beirut’s southern Dahiyeh neighborhood, a Hezbollah stronghold.
     
            Shortly afterward, the Israel Defense Forces said it “conducted a precise strike in Beirut.”
     
            US President Joe Biden is counseling Israel to take a proportional response to this week’s barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles, voicing opposition to a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear sites in the hopes of preventing the conflict that has erupted in the region from widening further.
     
            American officials are not privately trying to persuade Israel to hold back on retaliating against Iran, two senior administration officials told CNN, a notable difference from April when Biden encouraged Israel to “take the win” following the successful interception of a barrage of Iranian drones and missiles.
     
            Instead, Biden hopes Israel will adopt a measured approach that can both uphold its right to strike back while avoiding action that could prompt further retaliation and tip the region into full-scale war.
     
            “No one’s saying don’t respond,” one senior administration official said. “No one’s saying, ‘Take the win.’”
     
            How that message will be received by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains to be seen, particularly as his political standing appears more assured following successful efforts to degrade Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            The stakes of the moment could not be higher. Biden has watched with mounting concern as tensions in the region have spiraled. Attempts at brokering ceasefire agreements both in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border have been largely fruitless. And the pending American presidential election has elevated the stakes of trying to manage the crisis.

            Eight people were killed in an Israeli strike on UN school building in Gaza, hospital officials in the area said Wednesday.
     
            Wounded victims, including children, were rushed to the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital after the attack at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East school building.
     
            The Israeli Air Force had conducted a “precise strike” on a former school for girls in the area, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, alleging that it was being used as a command and control center by Hamas.
     
            “The command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served as the ‘Nuseirat Girls’ School, was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel,” the IDF statement said.
     
            The IDF added that it took “numerous steps” to mitigate danger to civilians, “including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”
     
What CNN footage showed: Multiple children wounded in the strike arrived at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, including 3-month-old named Hala. The man holding Hala rushed her into the emergency room and placed her on a bed that had no mattress. Her body was covered in shrapnel injuries, and her head was wrapped in a white bandage. She shivered as a doctor examined her wounds. When he turned her around, it became apparent that she had been burned.
     
            “Suddenly, the rocket hit, and everyone was gone,” Hala’s grandmother told CNN. “This is my granddaughter, Hala Ahmad. She is 3-months-old. I don’t know where her mother is. I took the little ones and ran. I don’t know what happened to their mom.”
     
            The footage also showed a man lying on the floor, covered in blood and injuries. On the bed beside him, another injured child lay unconscious. Another child was brought into the emergency room and placed on the bed next to the baby.
     
            Another witness, Riham Qannufa, told CNN:
     
        “I was asleep. My daughter was with me at the school. Suddenly, a rocket hit the room we were in. My daughter was martyred, and my other daughter is inside.”
     
 
            A survivor from the October 7 Nova music festival massacre has been praised as a “hero” after he responded to two men opening fire near his home in Tel Aviv in a shooting and stabbing attack on Tuesday that killed at least seven people and injured 12.
     
            In a video posted online, Lev Kreitman was filmed from a nearby building in the neighborhood of Jaffa – apparently wearing a pink shirt and white shorts – firing a gun at an unknown target before running away. In another video, Kreitman, in the same clothing, was seen walking in the background among IDF soldiers who were on the scene of the attack.
     
            After the incident took place, Kreitman spoke to CNN affiliate Channel 11 and said he had a handgun on him after serving for six months in Gaza as a reservist with the IDF. He recalled Tuesday’s incident saying how he spotted “two terrorists” with one moving toward him.
     
            “The other goes somewhere else, runs somewhere else, and I’m here, right where we’re standing, I surprised him from the side, shoot,” Kreitman said, adding he understood straight away it was an attack.
     
            “I tried to do my best in the very crazy situation, amidst alarms, missiles, and interceptions in the sky.”
     
            In a post on X, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called Kreitman a “hero who neutralized the attack” in Jaffa and acted “bravely” in the October 7 attack as he “saved many people,” and used the opportunity to call for more Israelis to arm themselves.
     
            “Six months ago, he [Kreitman] submitted an application for a licence to carry personal weapon following the reform we led in which over 120,000 people armed themselves with personal weapons this year,” Ben-Gvir said. “Go arm yourself, it saves lives.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Tuesday’s attack and sent condolences to the families of those who were killed.
     
            Family members of hostages still in Gaza held an open-air banquet on Wednesday to both mark Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and call for the release of their loved ones.
     
            At the demonstration held near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in the coastal town of Caesarea, protesters placed fake headstones alongside the long banquet table, symbolizing the hostages who have been killed in Gaza.
     
            The banquet table was draped with a tablecloth bearing the slogan: “Let the old year and its abandonment come to an end.”
     
            Organizers said the event was being held to convey their “refusal to celebrate Rosh Hashanah” during the present “reckless reality.”
     
            “Many Israeli women and men are unable to celebrate when a year has passed and 101 hostages are still not here with us, and every opportunity for a deal is being torpedoed by the Israeli government and its leader,” organizers said in the statement.
     
            As nightfall descended, a crowd began to gather and chant loudly, calling for the hostages to be released. The Israeli flag was lowered to half-staff during the event in a local cemetery. Family members also lit a sign emblazoned with the Hebrew word for “hope.”
     
            A top US State Department official said the US’s “dominant message is, ‘let’s take great care in whatever we do with respect to Iran,’” following a missile attack by Tehran on Israel Tuesday.
     
            Israel has vowed a response to that attack, and US officials have concurred that there must be “consequences.” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell noted Wednesday that “with respect to the Iranian attack on Israel, it is not just Israel that is thinking about its response options; it is also the United States.”
     
            “The likely engagements over the next few days are to try to align, as much as we can, perspectives between Israel and the United States,” he said.
     
            The US recognizes that a response of some kind is important, but it also realizes that the region “is really balancing on a knife’s edge, and real concerns about an even broader escalation or a continuing one, not just simply an exchange of isolated salvos, but of more sustained hostility, which could imperil not just Israel, but our strategic interests as well,” he said at a virtual event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
     
            He said the administration and US President Joe Biden will seek to “compare notes” with Israel, noting there have been “major efforts on both sides to keep lines of communication open and to make sure that perspectives are understood.”
     
            “There have been moments of surprise, I don’t think that’s a secret, over the course the last couple of months,” he acknowledged.
     
            “We’ve stated all along our determination to support Israel. Its security challenges are real. Their responses are legitimate. But at the same time, I think we also recognize that the longer that these conflicts go on, the challenges and the uncertainties associated with unpredictable issues associated with escalation, they’re just very real,” Campbell said.
     
            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that while Iran does not seek war, it will deliver a “stronger response” if Israel retaliates following Iran’s missile attack Tuesday.
     
            Speaking in Doha alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Wednesday, Pezeshkian accused Israel of instigating insecurity in the region and condemned what he described as historical crimes.
     
        “We were left with no choice but to respond. If Israel wants to react, we will have a stronger response, this is what the Islamic Republic is committed to,” Pezeshkian said.
     
 
            Hours after Tuesday’s unprecedented attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Iran made a big mistake tonight — and it will pay for it.”
     
            Pezeshkian’s remarks come after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles in Tuesday’s barrage, which it said was in response to the killings of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            Iran’s missile attack on Israel was a “necessary and proportionate response” to Israel’s “aggressive acts” in the Middle East over the past few months, the Iranian envoy to the United Nations said on Wednesday.
     
            Amir Saeid Iravani told the UN Security Council that Israel “only understands the language of force,” warning that any acts of aggression would not go unpunished.
     
        “Each act of restraint taken by Iran has only emboldened Israel to commit even greater crimes and more acts of aggression. Consequently, Iran’s response was necessary to restore balance and deterrence,” Iravani said.
     
 
            Earlier on Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said countries that helped block missiles targeting Israel on Tuesday would be “held responsible.”
     
            The threat environment in the United States “remains high” ahead of the November presidential  election and conflict in the Middle East, according to a new assessment by the Department of Homeland Security.
     
            The annual assessment released Wednesday warns of possible threats from violent extremists driven by the heated political environment in the US as well as foreign and domestic threats from terrorist groups and others inspired by conflicts abroad. It also comes amid a wider conflict in the Middle East after Israel assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and began a ground offensive in Lebanon. Iran retaliated on Tuesday by launching nearly 200 missiles at Israel.
     
            A senior DHS official told reporters Wednesday that the department is still working to figure out what Iran’s escalatory attack on Israel in recent days could mean for US security.
     
        “It’s of course true that events in the Middle East over the last 12 months have contributed to this heightened threat environment and continue to do so, and we’re in a constant effort to evaluate and monitor what’s happening abroad to determine what implications it has for here in the homeland,” the official said.
     
 
            The official also noted that the attack from Iran, paired with the one-year anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel last year, could “drive particular violent extremists here in the homeland to accelerate or look to take action on a timeline that may not have been anticipated.”
     
            “We are literally in the earliest days of trying to understand what exactly Iranian intentions might be,” the official said.
     
            Some of those intentions of Iran and other countries, according to officials and the report itself, are to sow confusion and chaos in the US 2024 presidential election.

            The US organized a charter flight for Americans to depart Lebanon on Wednesday and plans to offer future flights based on demand, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said.
     
            There were just over 100 people, including Americans and family members of American citizens, on the flight today, he said. The flight flew from Beirut to Istanbul.
     
        “It’s been a priority for us to enhance the capacity of flights in and out of the region, so we’ve contracted with additional carriers to facilitate the transport of American citizens,” Miller said. “We do hope to organize additional flights in the coming days, depending on demand.”
     
 
            Around 7,000 people have registered with the State Department to get more information about US-supported ways to depart Lebanon.
     
            “Some of those, I presume, will eventually look to depart Lebanon, and some of them will want to stay,” Miller said, adding that “their plans may change over time.”
     
            While the State Department is taking this new step in assisting Americans who are looking to leave Lebanon, the Biden administration has not stood up a non-combatant evacuation (NEO) in the country, which would trigger a process to support the ordered departure of nonessential American personal from the country.
     
            Hezbollah has claimed over two dozen attacks on Wednesday that mostly targeted Israeli troops amassing at the border in preparation for an invasion of south Lebanon.
     
            The increased rate of short-range attacks suggests that Hezbollah has focused its firepower on repelling an Israeli ground offensive. Israeli forces breached the border from at least three locations on Wednesday, and later withdrew, according to the Lebanese army and a United Nations peacekeeping forces (UNIFIL) source.
     
            At least eight Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in Lebanon, according to the country’s military. Hezbollah said it was engaged in seven clashes with advancing Israeli forces in Lebanon.
     
            Forty-seven people were taken to three hospitals after Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants engaged in fighting in Lebanon on Wednesday, the hospitals said.
     
            The hospitals didn’t specify if the injured were soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces, but Beilinson said that the wounded were from the “incident in Lebanon,” while Ziv and Rambam both announced they treated the injured after the IDF announced they had engaged in fighting with Hezbollah militants.
     
            Earlier, the Israeli military confirmed the death of eight soldiers killed in combat in Lebanon, and Hezbollah said it clashed with Israeli forces inside southern Lebanon.
     
            US officials are not privately trying to persuade Israel to hold back on retaliating against Iran in the aftermath of Tuesday’s attack, two senior Biden administration officials tell CNN.
     
            This is a notable difference from April, when Iran’s attacks on Israel then had prompted US President Joe Biden to urge Israel to walk away and “take the win.”
     
            “No one’s saying don’t respond,” one senior administration official said.  “No one’s saying ‘take the win.’”
     
            Israel did respond against Iran but in a limited way, striking an air defense system in Isfahan. But now a bigger Israeli counterattack is expected that could include a whole range of targets, with concern they could include Iran’s nuclear facilities.
     
            The administration currently assesses that it’s unlikely Israel would strike Iran’s nuclear sites. One senior official said Israel still hasn’t decided.
     
        “They are doing the smart thing and taking a beat and thinking about it,” the official said.
     
 
            Biden told reporters on Wednesday that Israel should not take that course of action but said, “Israel has a right to respond. It should be a proportional response.”
     
            No Israelis were hurt or killed in Tuesday’s Iranian attack that appeared to target military and intelligence facilities. One Palestinian man was killed in the West Bank by shrapnel from an interceptor missile launched by Israel, according to the hospital where he was treated.
     
            With the three-day Jewish New Year holiday Rosh Hashanah starting on Wednesday, that could push back the Israeli response, which was not immediate after Iran’s attack midday on Tuesday.
     
            “They have the holiday so that buys time and space,” one of the senior US officials said.
     
            Responding to reports that a US citizen was killed in Lebanon, the State Department said that the individual killed was in fact a legal permanent resident of the US.
     
            “It’s our understanding that it was a legal permanent resident, not an American citizen, but we obviously offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller at a news briefing.
     
            Miller did not provide details on how the individual was killed.
     
            Hamas has claimed responsibility for a shooting and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that left at least seven people dead and 16 wounded.
     
            The militant group said two of its fighters from the city of Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, carried out the attack in different locations, including a train station.
     
            Israeli police said on Wednesday that the attackers were stopped by security forces and civilians who used personal guns. One of the attackers was killed at the scene. The other was severely injured.
     
            Israeli strikes in recent weeks have destroyed about 50% of Hezbollah’s arsenal, a formidable collection of ballistic and cruise missiles as well as rockets, according to senior US and Israeli officials.
     
            Multiple officials described the organization as “decapitated” after a series of Israeli operations decimated Hezbollah’s leadership structure, including a covert operation that caused dozens of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon to explode and the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah.
     
        “The most important thing that we did was to try to take out about half of the missile and rocket capability that have been built up over the last 30 years with Iran,” a senior Israeli official said. “And we did.”
     
 
Take a look at what the group’s publicly known arsenal was capable of: 
 
            But multiple officials cautioned that the group still has inventory hidden away. Israel has not destroyed all of Hezbollah’s arsenal — and it was not immediately clear which projectiles have been destroyed. It’s possible the group has retained a proportion of its more sophisticated long-range fire options, like ballistic and cruise missiles, which current and former US officials said the group has so far held back from using in recent exchanges with Israel.
     
            One US official noted that Israel had largely destroyed “forward deployed, less advance missiles” — although, this person noted, with the destruction of Hezbollah’s leadership, it’s an open question who might order the firing of remaining stockpiles.
     
            The overall picture is of a terror group that has been severely degraded — the group notably did not participate in Monday’s Iranian attack on Israel — but remains dangerous. For nearly a year, US intelligence officials have assessed that Hezbollah did not want to invite full-scale war with Israel. Some US analysts are now quietly questioning whether the punishing campaign Israel has carried out may have removed any incentive the group has to avoid escalation, or not to return to a strategy of launching international terror attacks.
     
            Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Iran needs to “be stopped” as tensions ramp up in the Middle East.
     
            Iran’s attack on Israel Tuesday — in which Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets — “shows that they must be stopped,” Pelosi said on Wednesday, but added that “we want to avoid a bigger war.”
     
            Pelosi said she doesn’t think “we should get into an open discussion now as to how to deal with (Iran’s) nuclear” capabilities. US President Joe Biden said earlier today that he does not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites.
     
        “I think that there are other countries, as we had before, who had worked together to do that again,” Pelosi said, referring to previous administrations’ plans to reduce the capacity of Iran’s ability to make nuclear weapons. “But the reason that they’re in a strong position they are today nuclear-wise is because of the failed policy of (former President) Donald Trump.”
     
 
            Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.
     
            When asked if she trusted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision-making and judgment, Pelosi said the Israeli leader should be focused on freeing hostages held in Gaza “first and foremost.”
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been trading cross-border fire since the day after the October 7 terror attacks last year, but Israel’s launch Tuesday of what it described as a “limited” and “localized” ground operation in Lebanon have taken people on both sides into a new reality.
     
            While Israel insists its actions in Lebanon do not amount to a major incursion, the situation on the ground seems to suggest it is preparing for the possibility of expanding its presence there.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday it was sending an additional division — consisting of thousands of soldiers — to participate in the ground war. Driving around the border area on Tuesday, CNN saw a number of military vehicles and troops and heard fighter jets.
     
            Hezbollah and Israel both said on Wednesday that their forces clashed in southern Lebanon, and the IDF announced that eight Israeli soldiers were killed in combat — the first casualties of the ground operation there.
     
            Separately, Hezbollah claimed to have hit an Israeli military barracks with rockets near Shomera, on the Israel-Lebanon border, in the early hours of Wednesday.
     
            Israel’s Rambam Hospital said there was an “incident” in the north, but that it could not comment on the numbers of people admitted for treatment.
     
            But while these events, coupled with the noticeable troop buildup on the border, suggest the fighting might soon intensify, both Israel and Lebanon are seemingly seeking to downplay the situation.
     
Why would they look to downplay? Both have a good reason to do so. Israel is already facing severe criticism over the war in Gaza — and while many of its allies say they support its right to defend itself, they have called on Israel to exercise restraint in Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah, meanwhile, is desperate to project strength after being greatly weakened by a string of attacks which killed many of its top leaders, including longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has sent a stark message regarding a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, warning that Israel has the means to “strike any target in the Middle East.”
     
            Visiting the Tel Nof Air Base on Wednesday, Halevi said Israel knows how to “locate important targets” and will respond to Iran’s attack with strikes of “precision and power.”
     
        “We have the capabilities to reach and strike any point in the Middle East. And those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will soon understand,” Halevi said in a video clip filmed at the base.
     
 
            While Israelis across the country celebrate the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, on Wednesday, Halevi said the Israeli military is still “operating and striking on all fronts.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a similar warning in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s missile strikes from Iran, promising that Tehran “will pay” for its actions.
     
            Netanyahu accused Tehran of failing to understand Israel’s “determination to retaliate” against its enemies and promised to strike back.
     
            Wednesday’s comments echo Netanyahu’s first public statement after an Israeli airstrike killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, in Beirut on Friday.
     
            “There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach,” he said.
     
            US President Joe Biden says he’ll likely speak to his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “relatively soon,” following Iran’s missile attack on Israel.
     
            “I’ll probably be talking to him relatively soon,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Answers.
     
            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke on August 21, according to White House readouts. Since then, the situation in the region has grown dramatically more tense as Israel seeks to degrade Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            Biden said the US was offering advice directly to Israeli officials about the country’s potential response to the attack.
     
            “We’ll be discussing with the Israelis what they’re going to do,” Biden said.
     
            “We’ve been talking to Bibi’s people the whole time,” he added, using Netanyahu’s nickname.
     
            Biden’s phone calls with Netanyahu over the past year have at times grown tense as the two men diverge over Israel’s actions in Gaza.
     
            US President Joe Biden says he does not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites.
     
            “The answer is no,” Biden said when questioned about the prospect of Israel launching a retaliatory strike on sites related to Iran’s nuclear program.
     
            He said the United States would discuss with the Israelis how they might respond to Iran’s missile attack.
     
            He said all members of the Group of 7, with whom he’d conversed in a phone call earlier Wednesday, agreed that Israel should “respond proportionally.”
     
            “Iran is way off course,” he said.
     
            G7 leaders are considering new sanctions against Iran, according to a White House statement.
     
More background: US officials have long assessed that both Iran and senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as both have exchanged fire.
     
            One big fear for US and Arab diplomats is the possibility of Israel striking inside Iran, potentially against its nuclear facilities. Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett urged Israel to retaliate by destroying its nuclear program.
     
            But Iran has made clear that any response from Israel would result in further escalation. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tuesday’s operation was “only a portion of our power.”
     
            Israel is likely eyeing Iran’s nuclear facilities as it determines its response to Tehran’s missile attack, according to Malcolm Davis, senior analyst for defense strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
     
            “From Israel’s perspective, it cannot allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. There would certainly be strong pressure within Netanyahu’s cabinet to attack those nuclear facilities and essentially set back the Iranian nuclear weapons program, potentially for years,” Davis told CNN’s Becky Anderson.
     
            World leaders are considering new sanctions against Iran in the aftermath of Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel, according to the White House. Those moves, the White House said in a readout, were discussed during a call between President Joe Biden and his G7 counterparts.
     
            “Today, President Biden joined a call with the G7 to discuss Iran’s unacceptable attack against Israel and to coordinate on a response to this attack, including new sanctions,” the statement said.
     
        It continued: “President Biden and the G7 unequivocally condemned Iran’s attack against Israel. President Biden expressed the United States’ full solidarity and support to Israel and its people, and reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.”
     
 
            The world is awaiting Israel’s response to Iran’s attack, with high stakes for the Biden administration amid fears of an escalating regional conflict just 34 days until the US election.
     
            Biden has said the US remains “fully supportive” of Israel and that there is “active discussion” on an appropriate response.
     
            The perpetual buzz of drones hovering above the village of Shtula in northern Israel was interrupted by several loud booms of artillery fire on Tuesday afternoon, followed by the piercing sound of sirens warning the few remaining residents of incoming fire.
     
            But, while everyone rushed for cover, Ora Hatan stayed put. The 61-year-old is used to the reality of life on the Israel-Lebanon border. Frequent cross-border fire and the threat of war don’t seem to scare her – even though her neighbor’s house was hit by a rocket not long ago.
     
            Israel evacuated some 60,000 people from this and neighboring regions shortly after the October 7 terror attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza sparked a new wave of violence by Hezbollah along the northern border.
     
            But Hatan refused to leave.
     
        “My parents came 80 years ago from Iraq. They were refugees in Iraq, and they didn’t come to Israel after thousands of years (for their) grandsons to be refugees in our country,” she told CNN.
     
 
            “It’s my country, it’s my home, it’s my land,” she said.
     
            Hatan, who lived in the same house in 2006, when Israel invaded Lebanon, said she is hoping there won’t be a major ground war.
     
            “I think that we can protect the border by plane. Or to go (in) and come back… But not stay (in Lebanon), it’s too dangerous,” she said, adding that she believes the solution to the current crisis will eventually be found in an agreement.
     
            “So why sacrifice people for this war?” she said.
     
            Hatan has spent most of the last two days cooking a feast to celebrate the Jewish New Year, which started on Wednesday. As she rushed around the kitchen, the howls of jackals sounded in the background, possibly startled by the sounds of combat.
     
            She told CNN she cooked 50 chickens, dozens of pounds of beef, vegetable sides and other delicacies. The Israeli soldiers stationed nearby were coming to pick up the food later.
     
            Hatan said she was not worried about having soldiers around. “I’m sure that (Hezbollah) see me, that I live here, that I feed the animals and I’m staying here,” she said standing on her terrace, the Lebanese border just a mile away.

            Three civilians were killed and three others were wounded in an Israeli strike in the Mezzah neighborhood of Damascus on Wednesday, Syrian state news agency SANA said, citing a military source.
     
            The strike targeted a residential building and caused damage to private properties nearby, SANA added.
     
            Asked about reports of the strike, the Israeli military told CNN that it does not comment on foreign reports.
     
            The purported strike comes after SANA reported that three people were killed, including a Syrian TV journalist, in another Israeli strike on Damascus overnight Tuesday. The Israeli military declined to comment on that incident.
     
            As news began to pour in about clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters inside Lebanon on Wednesday, the Iran-backed militant group was conducting a media tour around destroyed parts of southern Beirut.
     
            The fighting on Lebanese territory was a major development, the first signs of Israel’s anticipated ground invasion of the southern part of the country. Lebanon’s army has said that Israeli troops forced breached the border on Wednesday, advancing around 400 meters (around 440 yards) before withdrawing. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has confirmed that eight of its soldiers were killed in combat.
     
            In southern Beirut, Hezbollah’s seat of power, the group’s spokesperson Mohammad Afif made his first public remarks on the developments from amid the rubble of a building struck down by an Israeli airstrike in recent days.
     
            “We engaged in clashes in Adayseh in the morning and in Maroun al-Ras just minutes before the press conference,” said Afif, referring to Lebanese border villages where Israel is reported to have conducted an incursion.
     
            Behind him, mounds of debris were adorned with Hezbollah banners and posters of its late leader Hassan Nasrallah. These were the first images produced by the group since Nasrallah’s death in an Israeli airstrike last Friday – a halo around his head signifies his passing.
     
            Afif also issued Hezbollah’s first reaction to Iran’s missile strikes on Israel last night, which Tehran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said avenged Nasrallah’s death.
     
        “For all those who doubted Iran’s stance after the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh until recent weeks have been smacked in the mouth by a big rock,” Afif said in an impassioned statement. Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran in July. “Iran is the heart of the axis of resistance. Iran will not abandon the resistance nor the peoples of the resistance,” Afif added.
     
 
            Press access to the southern suburbs of Beirut, a densely populated neighborhood, is rare. During the media tour, which covered the eastern part of the vicinity, CNN saw sidewalks covered in shattered glass, blown-out storefronts and a collapsed building on nearly every other block.
     
            It was the first time the CNN team, which reports frequently from Beirut, had seen the aftermath of more than five days of Israeli bombardment in this part of the Lebanese capital.
     
        “We’ll rebuild it all,” said one man on a moped. “Until then, we are going to step on Israel’s honor.”
     
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent condolences to the families of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon on Wednesday.
     
            Eight Israeli troops have been killed in combat since their offensive began in southern Lebanon, according to the Israeli military.
     
        “I would like to send my condolences from the bottom of my heart to the families of our heroes who fell today in Lebanon,” Netanyahu said in a video message.
     
 
            Israel remains locked in the “middle of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil which seeks to destroy us,” the Israeli leader added.
     
            On Tuesday night, the conflict between the two warring nations intensified once again after Iran fired around 200 ballistic missiles as part of nationwide attack on Israeli territory.
     
            Speaking just hours after the Iranian assault, Netanyahu promised not to allow Iran to win, stressing that Israelis will “stand” and “win together.”
     
            The Israeli military announced the deaths of seven additional Israeli soldiers who were killed in combat in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, bringing the total toll since the offensive began to eight.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said an officer and four soldiers from the Egoz Unit were “severely injured.”
     
            The IDF did not say which areas in southern Lebanon the soldiers were killed. In addition to the Egoz Unit, the soldiers served in the Golani Brigade and the Yahalom Unit.
     
            Earlier Wednesday, the IDF announced the death of another soldier.
     
            Hezbollah said in separate statements that it had targeted Israeli forces in three different villages in southern Lebanon.
     
            The Lebanese army has said that an Israeli force breached 400 meters (about a quarter mile) in Lebanon and withdrew shortly after.
     
            US President Joe Biden will participate in a call with G7 leaders today to discuss the situation in the Middle East, a source familiar with the call said.
     
            The call comes as the US and allies are awaiting word on how Israel plans to respond to Iran’s missile attack on Tuesday. US officials have said Iran will face “severe consequences” for the attack, and officials across the Biden administration have remained in regular contact with Israeli counterparts as they determine their next steps
     
            Top officials from several G7 countries, including, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have all condemned Iran’s attack on Israel, warning of potentially disastrous consequences for the wider region.
     
            Several Iranian missiles struck Israeli military bases on Tuesday night, an Israeli military source told CNN, but insisted there was no major damage to the facilities.
     
            “There is no harm to the functionality of the IAF (Israeli Air Force),” the source said.
     
            The source said there were “a few hits,” but that they failed to hit “essential infrastructure.”
     
            As Israel’s ground operation in southern Lebanon intensifies, the Israel Defense Forces has sent evacuation orders to 51 villages, instructing residents to move north.
     
            The area under the IDF evacuation orders makes up a quarter of all Lebanese territory, with its inhabitants pushed more than 30 miles north of their homes.
     
            Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz has declared United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres persona non grata in Israel, effectively barring him from entering the country.
     
            The announcement was made on Wednesday in response to what Katz described as Guterres’ failure to unequivocally condemn Iran’s attack on Israel and what he called his support for terrorist organizations.
     
            “Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,” Katz said. He accused Guterres of being an anti-Israel UN chief who provides “support to terrorists,” such as Hamas, Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Iran.
     
            The decision follows a series of statements from Guterres that, according to Katz, reflect a continued bias against Israel since the start of the conflict. Katz criticized the UN leader for failing to take a firm stance on Hamas’ atrocities on October 7, 2023, and for failing to push for resolutions designating the group as a terrorist organization.
     
        “Guterres will be remembered as a stain on the history of the UN for generations to come,” the foreign minister added. “Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres.”
     
 
            Guterres rejected the designation from Katz, responding to it at the United Nations General Assembly:
     
        “As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April, and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed, I again strongly condemn yesterday’s massive missile attack by Iran on Israel. And these attacks paradoxically do nothing to support the cause of the Palestinian people or reduce their suffering.”
     
 
This post has been updated with response from Guterres. 
 
            A somber mood has fallen over Tehran as citizens fear a massive retaliatory attack on their country after Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel Tuesday night.
     
            Tehran residents told CNN that many venues, including movie theaters, were already shut in mourning over the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli attack on Beirut last week.
     
            In response, Iran launched a salvo of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli targets on Tuesday, its largest-ever such attack, sending sirens blaring across Israel and activating the country’s sophisticated defense systems.
     
            Asked how they plan to prepare for a possible retaliation, one Iranian, who did not wish to give their name for fear of retribution, said: “I’ve told my family to leave Tehran if they can,” adding that while Israel could target Iran’s nuclear facilities, it may also “hit the city.”
     
            Not everyone is prepared to leave, however. “We didn’t leave during Iran-Iraq war,” said another resident of Tehran, referring to the eight-year conflict between the two states in the 1980s.
     
            A female resident said Israel is likely to hit nuclear sites first, then “we will see what happens after,” before adding, “Where would we go anyway?”
     
            The Israeli military confirmed Wednesday the death of the first soldier during fighting in Lebanon.
     
            A 22-year-old squad commander in the Israel Defense Forces Commando Brigade “fell during combat,” according to a statement by the IDF.
     
            Hezbollah said it clashed with Israeli forces inside southern Lebanon earlier. The IDF did not say where in Lebanon the soldier was killed.
     
            Iran’s missile attack against Israel on Tuesday was intended to signal that Tehran’s arsenal is capable of inflicting mass casualties, Middle East experts say.
     
            Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj.media, a London-based news site focused on covering the Middle East, said that unlike its attack on Israel in April — which was meant to merely showcase Iran’s capabilities and had been telegraphed in advance, allowing it to be largely thwarted — Tuesday’s barrage was intended to send the message that Iran can inflict significant damage if it chooses to.
     
            “The (Iranian) response was measured and geared to send a message through accuracy and ability to bypass Israeli air defenses, rather than inflicting mass casualties,” Shabani said.
     
            Ali Ahmadi, an executive fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, said that “Iran’s April attack was deliberately designed to be ineffective so as to not escalate,” but the feeling in Iran is that it was taken as a sign of weakness.
     
        “Iran felt that it had to discredit Israeli and American air defenses,” Ahmadi told CNN, adding that even though Tuesday’s attack did not cause mass casualties, it “did establish that Israel can be made to take on serious cost.”
     
 
            Others disagree, however. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank in Washington, DC, said Iran’s actions were meant to show that it is indeed responding to Israel’s recent assassinations of key Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, “both by domestic and foreign audiences for purposes of regime security and survival.”
     
            He noted, however, that despite the lack of mass casualties, “we cannot assume that a desire to wash blood away with blood was not present.” The lack of damage had more to do with Israel’s defense systems as well as the US and other regional allies’ support, he said.
     
            Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters have engaged in fighting on the ground in southern Lebanon, both have confirmed.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has had “close-range engagements,” destroyed more than 150 “terrorist infrastructure sites,” and “eliminated terrorists” in southern Lebanon in a post on X.
 
            Hezbollah spokesperson Mohamed Afif told reporters in Beirut that the Iran-backed group clashed with Israeli forces in Aadeyseh. In a separate statement it said clashes are ongoing with Israeli soldiers in the southern Lebanese village of Maroun Al-Ras.
     
            The Israeli military has not commented on the Hezbollah claim. The IDF spokesperson has implored people “not to share reports about the activities of the forces, due to the security of our forces. Stick to the official reports only and do not spread irresponsible rumors.”
     
            Lebanon’s military said Wednesday an Israeli military force breached the border, reaching 400 meters (about a quarter of a mile) into Lebanese territory before withdrawing.
     
            “An Israeli enemy force breached the Blue Line by approximately 400 meters into Lebanese territory in the areas of Khirbet Yaroun and the Aadeyseh, then withdrew after a short period,” the army said.
     
            The Blue Line is a reference to the demarcation border area that separates Israel and Lebanon.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
     
            The IDF also released a photo of its troops inside Lebanon that CNN has geolocated ﻿to be inside southern Lebanon.
     
            Countries that helped block missiles targeting Israel will “be held responsible,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Wednesday.
     
            Araghchi was responding to a question from reporters on Jordan’s help in intercepting projectiles fired from Iran towards Israel on Tuesday. The US and UK were also involved in defending Israel.
     
            Iran fired scores of missiles at Israel in response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last week.
     
            Jordan’s military said in a statement following the Iranian attack that all units and formations in its armed forces’ general command have been put on “on high alert to confront any attempts that threaten the security and stability of the kingdom.”
     
            “Jordan’s position has always been that it will not be a battleground for anyone, protecting Jordan and its people is our number one responsibility,” Mohammad al-Momani, Minister of Government Communication, told the state-funded al-Mamlaka TV channel on Wednesday.
     
            Jordan, a US ally, helped intercept missiles during another Iranian attack targeting Israel in April, sparking warnings from Tehran.
     
            Iran’s attack on Israel Tuesday injured three people in Jordan and missile fragments fell in different parts of the country, including the capital Amman.
     
            Jordanian state media broadcasts showed damage in several locations including one report from Balqa governorate, northwest of Amman, where a reporter said a 2-meter (6′ 7″) missile fragment had landed.
     
            After carrying out its biggest ballistic missile attack on Israel Tuesday, Iran has said it is “absolutely” not interested in a wider war.
     
            Iranian government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told reporters on Wednesday that Israel is responsible for the regional escalation and that Tehran is acting in self-defense. Iran fired 180 projectiles at Israel, according to the Israeli military, most of which were intercepted — although some landed on the ground in Israel.
     
            Speaking after the assault, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran made a “big mistake” and “will pay” for it. “The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies,” he said.
     
If you’re just join﻿ing us, here’s what else to know:
 
Israel sending troops: The Israeli military is sending an additional division to participate in the ground war in southern Lebanon, it announced Wednesday. The size of Israeli military units are classified, but a division typically consists of at least 10,000 troops.
     
Homes in central Israel damaged: Shock waves caused by Iran’s missile attack have damaged homes in central Israel, authorities in the country said Wednesday.
     
Gaza death toll: In Gaza, At least 90 people were killed in multiple Israeli strikes on Gaza overnight as the war in the enclave shows no letup. At least 51 people were killed and dozens injured during an Israeli incursion in Khan Younis overnight, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Wednesday.
     
Houthi attacks on Israel: Yemen’s Houthi militant group said it fired three cruise missiles toward Israel that successfully reached their targets on Wednesday, without providing evidence to support the claim.
     
            At least 90 people have been killed in multiple Israeli strikes on Gaza overnight as the war in the enclave shows no letup.
     
            At least 51 people were killed and dozens injured during an Israeli incursion in Khan Younis overnight, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Wednesday.
     
            “A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads,” the ministry said, adding that “ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them.”
     
            A member of the Gaza Civil Defense said Israeli strikes began on Tuesday in an area “where hundreds of displaced people were taking shelter” and teams were facing difficulty in recovery missions because of a lack of equipment.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the incursion in Khan Younis.
     
            In Gaza City, the Israeli military said it carried out strikes on two schools. At least 21 people were killed in the strikes on the sites where Palestinians were sheltering, many of them children, the Civil Defense and a medical source at Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City said. The Israeli military said it carried out “precise” strikes, and that they were targeting a “Hamas command and control centers” inside “compounds that previously served” as schools in Gaza City.
     
            In another incident in Gaza City, the Civil Defense and Al Ahli Hospital said four people were killed, including two children.
     
            Israeli artillery shelling south of Wadi Gaza, near Netzarim, killed 14 people overnight, and airstrikes on Nuseirat in central Gaza, killed six people, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
     
            Dead and shrouded children were brought into the hospital after a strike south of Wadi Gaza, the video shows. One of them is clearly only a few months old and her father bends down to clear her face from dust and sand.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. Earlier, they had said “troops identified dozens of suspects moving toward” them and “posing an immediate threat to them.” The soldiers opened fire at the suspects and “hits were identified.”
     
            The Israeli military has urged residents of two dozen villages in southwest Lebanon, located within 18 miles (30 kilometers) of the border, to move about 31 miles further into the country.
     
        “You must immediately move to the north of the Al-Awali River. Save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately,” the Israel Defense Forces Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said Wednesday.
     
 
Where is the Awali river? The Awali river is north of the city of Sidon, and just south of Beirut. The total land mass south of the river represents a quarter of Lebanese territory.  The affected villages are primarily located in the southwestern region of the country and around the main city of Tyre.
     
            The warnings come a day after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 27 villages on Tuesday. Wednesday’s warning expands the evacuation notice further to the west within southern Lebanon.
     
            The spokesperson repeated earlier calls for residents not to travel “using vehicles” north of the Litani River towards southern Lebanon.
     
            Iran insisted it has “absolutely no interest in a broader war,” hours after it fired dozens of missiles at Israel in response to the assassinations of Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told reporters on Wednesday that Israel is responsible for the regional escalation and that Tehran is acting in self-defense.
     
            Iran “restrained” itself after the assassination of Haniyeh “despite demands” from its people to respond, Mohajerani said, “because it was interested in peace in Gaza.” Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital, Tehran, in July in an attack widely believed to have been carried out by Israel.
     
            The spokeswoman said Israel “fueled this atmosphere,” but added that “we will never allow an inch of our soil or the dignity of Iran to be stained.”
     
            Iran fired 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. Many were intercepted, the Israeli military said, although some hit the ground in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
     
            Deadly fighting between Israel and Iran-backed militant groups has ramped up in recent weeks as the Israeli military expands its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            Along with Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah is part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” an alliance of Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen. The proxies give Iran strategic depth against its enemies.
     
            In support of Hamas and Palestinians, Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis have launched regular attacks on Israel over the past year. They have vowed to keep fighting until the war in Gaza ends.
     
Here’s what to know about the groups:
 
Hezbollah: The Lebanese group is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. The Shiite group emerged out of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years before it was driven out by Hezbollah. In 2006, Hezbollah and Israel fought a war for 34 days, which ended with no clear victor.
     
The Houthis: The Shiite group, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology, has been fighting Saudi-backed forces for more than a decade in Yemen’s civil war. While the Houthis do not pose as much of a threat to Israel as Hamas and Hezbollah, they have wreaked havoc over the past year in the Red Sea, where they have launched strikes at commercial ships they deemed linked to Israel and its allies, threatening to choke global trade.
     
Hamas: The group emerged in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist group from Egypt. Hamas considers Israel’s existence as illegitimate and seeks its destruction. It receives funding, weapons and training from Iran.
     
            The US has designated Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations.
     
Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the length of Israel’s occupation in southern Lebanon. It was 18 years. The description of the goals of Hamas has also been updated to more accurately convey their meaning.
 
            The Israeli military is sending an additional division to participate in the ground war in southern Lebanon, it announced Wednesday.
     
            The size of Israeli military units are classified, but a division typically consists of at least 10,000 troops.
     
            The addition of such a large number of soldiers comes despite Israel’s claim that its operation in Lebanon is “limited, localized, targeted” –  a description it repeated today.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has ordered Lebanese civilians in dozens of villages to leave their homes and move north of the Awali River, which is about 30 miles north of the border with Israel.
     
            The military said the 36th Division of the IDF and additional forces were joining its operations targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah. The division includes soldiers from the Golani Brigade, 188th Armored Brigade and 6th Infantry Brigade, the IDF said. They are accompanied by the Israeli Air Force and the 282nd Artillery Brigade, it added.
     
            The military last month moved the elite 98th division from Gaza to northern Israel.
     
            The number of Israeli troops on the ground in southern Lebanon remains unclear following the military’s announcement Tuesday of an incursion across its northern border.
     
            The Israeli military has staged some “sporadic raids” across the Lebanon-Israel border but its troops have not remained on Lebanese soil, a source from the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon said. The assessment that Israel has not yet launched a full-scale invasion was supported by two other high-level Lebanese security sources.
     
            Israeli troops laid the groundwork for the incursion in recent days, ramping up airstrikes that have killed more than a thousand people, destroyed homes and displaced about 1 million in Lebanon.
     
Some context: Previous military operations initially declared by Israel to be limited in their goals have proved to be anything but. Examples include Israel’s years-long occupation of southern Lebanon that began in 1982 with the stated aim of a brief and limited mission to destroy the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the country.
     
            More recently, Israel’s military declared a “limited” operation in Rafah, southern Gaza that has left the city in ruins.
     
            Iran’s attack has further changed the dynamics of Israel’s conflicts in the Middle East from a war involving Iran’s proxies toward a direct confrontation between two regional military powerhouses.
     
            It’s the second time Iran has launched an aerial attack on Israel this year, but Tuesday’s barrage was of a different magnitude.
     
            In April, Iran launched an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel – the first such direct assault on the country from its soil – in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria.
     
            Iran gave 72 hours’ notice ahead of that attack, widely seen as designed to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle with almost all projectiles intercepted. Israel responded with a limited strike on Iran.
     
            This time, Israel learned about the threat just hours before.
     
            Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran’s Tuesday barrage was twice as large as the April attack. It also included many more ballistic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, posing a real threat to Israeli citizens.
     
No place for diplomacy? Diplomacy has so far failed to broker a deal between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah. And the ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Iran-backed Hamas and Israel have floundered.
     
            Until weeks ago, some senior US officials believed that Washington had helped to successfully thwart a large-scale Iranian attack against Israel, sources told CNN.
     
            “I think Nasrallah was the final straw” for Iran, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region.
     
            With no off-ramp, and Israel appearing unwilling to compromise with its regional enemies, Tuesday’s attack is perhaps the clearest sign a much-feared regional war may be about to ignite.
     
            Israel is likely eyeing Iran’s nuclear facilities as it determines its response to Tehran’s missile attack, according to Malcolm Davis, senior analyst for defense strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
     
            Iran’s breakout time – the time needed to produce enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon – is now at about one or two weeks, the United States has assessed.
     
        “From Israel’s perspective, it cannot allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. There would certainly be strong pressure within Netanyahu’s cabinet to attack those nuclear facilities and essentially set back the Iranian nuclear weapons program, potentially for years,” Davis told CNN’s Becky Anderson.
     
 
            Israel could target Iran’s nuclear facilities with a traditional military attack or a cyberattack more akin to what it used against Hezbollah’s pagers and walkie-talkies, intercepting the supply chain and adding explosives to the devices, Davis said.
     
            “Whatever Israel does do, it has to be highly visible and it has to be seen to be decisive and successful.”
     
            Tehran, meanwhile, is likely hoping “there will be some restraint,” said Salam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House.
     
            Israel has made it clear it will do “whatever it can” to address its Iran security problem, which has required it to “take out as much of the command and control of the ‘Axis of Resistance’ — from Hamas to Hezbollah to targeting Iranian facilities in Syria,” Vakil told CNN’s Anderson.
     
        “Iran is trying to throw down some red lines, knowing full well that it is in a defensive position, that Hezbollah is compromised, and that it doesn’t have the traditional conventional capabilities to fight Israel.”
     
 
            Yemen’s Houthi militant group said they fired three cruise missiles toward Israel that successfully reached their targets on Wednesday, without providing evidence to support the claim.
     
            The Houthis, part of an Iran-led alliance that has ramped up attacks on Israel and its allies since the war in Gaza began last year, said that it launched three Quds 5 cruise missiles.
     
            A spokesperson for the Israeli military told CNN it was unaware of any attacks launched from Yemen.
     
            The Houthis, who have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea and the Strait of Bab al-Mandab since November, have said they will not stop until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.
     
            The group also warned the United States and the United Kingdom on Wednesday that their support for Israel would continue to put their interests in the region at risk of attack.
     
            Iran has described its Tuesday attack as a calibrated response to repeated escalations from Israel.
     
            Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the missile strikes were in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and other commanders, including Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            Along with Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah is part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” — an alliance of Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen. The proxies give Iran strategic depth against its enemies.
     
            Following the assassination of Hamas’ most public figure after attending the inauguration of Iran’s new president in July, the world waited to see how Tehran would respond.
     
            Then came Israel’s assassination of Nasrallah as it expanded its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a fiery speech directed at Iran, saying Israel was “changing the balance of power in the region” and that “there is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach.”
     
            Nasrallah’s death was necessary, he said, to returning thousands of residents to their homes along the Lebanon border displaced by Hezbollah rocket attacks, and to prevent the group from launching a large-scale attack on Israel.
     
            US officials have long assessed that both Iran and senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as both have exchanged fire.
     
            But Iran has made clear that any response from Israel would result in further escalation. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tuesday’s operation was “only a portion of our power.”
     
            Shock waves caused by Iran’s missile attack have damaged homes in central Israel, authorities in the country said Wednesday.
     
            Officials in the city of Hod Hasharon were providing assistance to about 100 affected households, the municipality said, adding that no injuries were reported.
     
            Iran will extend the closure of its airspace until Thursday morning, according to the semi-official outlet Mehr News on Wednesday.
     
        “To maintain the safety of flights and conditions in the region, all flights across the country will be canceled until 5 am tomorrow,” Mehr reported, quoting a spokesperson of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization.
     
 
            The organization had announced late Tuesday that all flights nationwide would be canceled until Wednesday morning.
     
            Tehran has thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles with a variety of ranges, according to a 2021 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
     
            Exact numbers for each type of missile are unknown. But US Air Force Gen. Kenneth McKenzie told Congress in 2023 that Iran had “over 3,000” ballistic missiles, according to the Iran Watch website.
     
            Ballistic missiles’ trajectories carry them outside or near the limits of Earth’s atmosphere, before the warhead payload separates from the rocket that carried it aloft and plunges back into the atmosphere and onto its target.
     
            Weapons experts who analyzed verified social media videos of the attack on Israel told CNN that Iran used variants of the Shahab-3 ballistic missile.
     
            The Shahab-3 is the foundation for all Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles using a liquid propellant, according to Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services.
     
            Iranian media reported that Tehran used a new missile, the Fattah-1, in the attacks.
     
            Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says the Fattah-1 appears to have a warhead on a “maneuverable reentry vehicle,” which enables it to make adjustments to avoid missile defenses during a short portion of its dive to its target.
     
            This ability would be an improvement on Iran’s earlier missiles, Hinz says. But analysts were skeptical that Iran would have used the new missile for the first time on Tuesday night.
     
Read the full story.
 
            Iran “does not want a wider war” following its unprecedented attack on Israel, former US Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CNN.
     
        “I think at this point they’ve realized they certainly can’t win it,” said Esper, a CNN analyst.
     
 
            Israel has vowed to retaliate to Iran’s attack. But even after Israel responds – which it could do by striking Iranian military or economic targets – Iran’s reaction is likely to be limited, Esper told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
     
            After its latest missile attack, which was largely intercepted by Israel and its allies, Iran has proved its military capabilities are “feckless,” he said.
     
            “I don’t know what Iran has left to respond with. Their proxy groups have been decimated,” he added, in reference to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
     
            Oil prices climbed further on Wednesday due to concerns about an escalation of hostilities in the Middle East.
     
            Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped just under 2% to $74.88 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, was 2% higher at $71.20. Each had finished about 2.5% higher on Tuesday.
     
            Rising tension in the region has “poured cold water” on the bullish sentiment that had been propelling financial markets over the past week, according to Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.
     
        “The real fireworks would come if Israel aimed for Iran’s economic jugular, its oil production. If Israel cripples Iran’s oil industry, global markets will be left scrambling to catch up,” he wrote in a Wednesday research note.
     
 
            Iran is a big producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). It exports most of its oil to China because of long-standing international sanctions, but analysts have previously said a reduction in those exports would have a massive impact on the global market.
     
            The uncertainty has also affected global stocks and other commodities markets. Except for Hong Kong, most Asian share markets fell into the red on Wednesday, following a sell-off on Wall Street. Gold, seen as a safe-haven investment, was trading close to last week’s all-time high.
     
            A spokesperson for Israel’s Rambam Hospital has told CNN there was an “incident” in the northern part of the country, but said they cannot comment on the amount of people admitted for treatment.
     
            Video geolocated by CNN showed several ambulances and a military helicopter outside the  hospital in Haifa.
     
            CNN reached out to the hospital after claims by Hezbollah that they had successfully targeted military positions in northern Israel.
     
            Rambam Hospital is the main medical facility in northern Israel and the key location for the treatment of soldiers wounded in that arena.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment, who said they cannot confirm or deny the reports.
     
            Hezbollah claims to have hit Israeli troops in multiple locations in recent hours, including a barracks near Shomera and in both Shtula and Misgav Am. The group also said it thwarted an Israeli military incursion into the Lebanese town of Al Adessah.
     
            CNN has not been able to verify Hezbollah’s claims.
     
            Two hundred missiles were fired during Iran’s Tuesday attack on Israel, according to the Commander-in-Chief of the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
     
            A video posted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Wednesday shows Sardar Salami reportedly speaking by telephone with Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian from the command room of the military operation.
     
        “200 missiles were fired in this operation,” he said on the call.
     
 
            The Israeli military said its initial estimate was that Iran had fired “approximately 180 projectiles.”
     
            US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Iran had launched “nearly 200 ballistic missiles” towards Israel.
     
            A statement from the IRGC, reported by Iran’s English-language Press TV, said that 90% of the missiles had successfully struck their targets.
     
            But both Israel and the US have downplayed the effectiveness of the strike. Israel said the attack “failed.”
     
            Sullivan said it was “defeated and ineffective.”
     
            Iran’s missile attack took place over the course of about one hour on Tuesday. The first nationwide alert was issued by the Israeli military at 12:32 a.m. local time (5:32 p.m. ET) followed by an update at 1:34 a.m. to civilians that it was safe to leave shelters.
     
            The Israeli military has warned residents of southern Lebanon “not to travel by car south of the Litani River.”
     
            The river runs laterally across much of the width of Lebanon’s southern territory, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with Israel.
     
        “Heavy fighting is taking place in southern Lebanon,” where Hezbollah is using “civilians as human shields,” the military said.
     
 
            The warning is in effect “until further notice,” the statement added.
     
            Danish police are investigating two blasts near Israel’s embassy in Copenhagen, Reuters reported Wednesday.
     
        “No one has been injured, and we are carrying out initial investigations at the scene,” Copenhagen police said in a post to X. “A possible connection to the Israeli embassy, in the area, is being investigated.”
     
 
            A large area was cordoned off amid heavy police presence, according to local media reports. The Israeli embassy was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.
     
            Hezbollah claimed it hit an Israeli military barracks with rockets near Shomera, on the Israel-Lebanon border, in the early hours of Wednesday.
     
            The Israeli military told CNN they “cannot confirm at this moment” but will provide more information as soon as they have an update.
     
            Sirens sounded in northern Israel overnight, but there’s been no further information regarding any interceptions or impact.
     
            Earlier, the Israeli military said “a projectile was identified crossing from Lebanon, which fell in an open area in central Israel.”
     
            The White House does not believe that Israel has made a determination on how to respond to Iran’s unprecedented missile attack, a senior US official told CNN.
     
            Top Biden administration officials and their Israeli counterparts have been in touch constantly in recent days and weeks, as they braced for a potential Iranian strike in retaliation for attacks on top Hamas and Hezbollah targets. Nearly 12 hours after that attack materialized, US counterparts had yet to receive detailed and decisive information about what to expect.
     
        “At some point, they will have to come to us with more details,” the official said, noting that the US made no proactive specifications for how Israel should respond.
     
 
Some background: After the US helped Israel intercept hundreds of drones and missiles fired by Iran in April, President Joe Biden urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “take the win,” CNN reported at the time.
     
            Israel pursued a more limited response against Tehran several days after the initial barrage, though the senior US official acknowledged this week’s attack – given the types of weapons used, with little notice, headed for intelligence and military targets – was on a “much bigger scale.”
     
            The two candidates to be the next US vice president sparred over which party’s ticket would be better placed to handle the expanding conflict in the Middle East during a televised debate Tuesday evening.
     
            Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz did not directly respond when asked whether he would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran if he were the final voice in the Situation Room. But he said he supports continuing to stand with Israel against Iran-backed proxies.
     
            Republican Senator JD Vance of Ohio said it would be up to Israel, taking into consideration “what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.”
     
            The two candidates also discussed former president Donald Trump’s 2018 decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by Barack Obama’s administration, which kept Iran from enriching uranium above around 4%. Making nuclear weapons requires uranium enriched to about 90%.
     
        “We had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran’s nuclear program in – the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump’s fickle leadership,” Walz said.
     
 
            Vance parried by claiming that Trump had made the world “more secure” and brought “peace through strength.” He did not directly address the moderator’s question on whether the former president had made a mistake withdrawing from the deal.
     
Some analysis: CNN’s Peter Bergen writes Vance’s claim that Trump made the world more secure is “simply nonsense.” He pointed to comments from Trump’s own top intelligence official, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, a former Republican senator, who testified before a Congressional committee in 2019 that the Obama-negotiated nuclear deal was working.

            Israel has vowed to respond to Iran’s largest ever attack on the country, fueling fears of a further escalation of conflict in the Middle East.
     
            Iran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel on Tuesday in what Tehran said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            The attack came just hours after Israel said it had launched a ground incursion against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. It said it intercepted many of the missiles, although some landed on the ground in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
     
At least one person was killed and several were injured during the attack, according to the Israeli military. The extent of the damage remains unclear.
 
Here’s what you need to know.
 
            Iran’s military chief said the missile attack launched Tuesday was limited to military targets, but warned of broader strikes if Israel responds.
     
            Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri said Iran had targeted military infrastructure including the Mossad intelligence agency, the Nevatim Air Base, Hatzor Air Base, radar installations and groupings of Israeli tanks, despite having the option of launching a much broader attack.
     
        “We had the capability to attack the regime’s economic infrastructure, but we only targeted military bases,” he said Wednesday.
     
 
            He added a warning to Israel and its supporters.
     
        “If the Zionist regime is not controlled and takes action against Iran, we will target all of its infrastructure,” he said.
     
 
            Bagheri said the strikes against Israel were in retaliation for the assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and Abbas Nilforoushan.
     
            Nasrallah, who led the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for more than 30 years, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday. Nilforoushan, a senior commander from Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was killed alongside him, according to Iranian state media.
     
            Hamas political leader Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in July using an explosive device that had been covertly hidden in the guesthouse where he was staying, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.
     
            “Since the assassination of Martyr Haniyeh, we have gone through a difficult period of restraint at the repeated request of the Americans and Europeans, who asked us to hold back to establish a ceasefire in Gaza. However, after the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Commander Nilforoushan, the situation became intolerable,” Bagheri said.
     
            CNN teams in Beirut heard blasts overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.
     
            Thick plumes of smoke were visible in the sky above the capital’s southern suburbs, a CNN photo shows.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier said it is striking Hezbollah targets in several southern suburbs of Beirut and more details of the operation would follow.
     
            It also told residents to evacuate several neighborhoods and buildings in the southern suburbs, where it suggested strikes are planned.
     
            In one of a few messages posted to X after midnight local time, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned that residents are located near “dangerous facilities belonging to Hezbollah against which the Defense Force will act with strength shortly.”
     
            Evacuation orders from the Israeli military have been posted on social media between midnight local time and 3 a.m., likely when many people are sleeping.
     
            An estimated 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced over the past couple of weeks, thousands of them sheltering in Beirut, including in schools on the edges of the southern suburbs of the city.
     
            Of the approximately 180 missiles the Israel Defense Forces say Iran fired Tuesday night, at least three apparent targets have emerged from a CNN analysis of geolocated videos of the attack.
     
            It’s still too early to tell whether the attack resulted in any serious damage – that will require daylight and likely satellite imagery – but by analyzing the videos from the attack we have a picture of what Iran targeted.
     
            Footage shows a significant concentration of missiles fell either at, or near, the headquarters of Mossad, Nevatim Air Base and Tel Nof Air Base.
     
            Those locations largely tally with what the US intelligence community, and the Israelis, believed would be targeted. Israel assessed that Iran would likely attack three Israeli air bases and an intelligence base, according to a person briefed on the matter. And a US military official told CNN that potential Iranian targets included air bases and intelligence command centers.
     
            Videos show at least two missiles falling near the Mossad HQ in Tel Aviv’s Glilot neighborhood, a densely populated area with a number of residential and commercial buildings.
     
            In southern Israel’s Negev desert, videos show a significant number of Iranian rockets hitting the Nevatim base. The facility, one of Israel’s largest, was previously hit by Iran during its April 13 attack (the IDF said the damage was minimal.)
     
            In the area of the Tel Nof base, more than 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, another video showed a number of impacts.
     
            Israel operates a range of defensive systems to block attacks by everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.
     
            The country’s Iron Dome system has been in the headlines often since regional hostilities ramped up last year in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza. But the Iron Dome is the bottom layer of Israel’s missile defense, according to the country’s Missile Defense Organization (IMDO).
     
            There are at least 10 Iron Dome batteries in Israel, each equipped with a radar that detects rockets and then uses a command-and-control system that quickly calculates whether an incoming projectile poses a threat or is likely to hit an unpopulated area. If the rocket does pose a threat, the Iron Dome fires missiles from the ground to destroy it in the air.
     
            The next rung up the missile defense ladder is David’s Sling, which protects against short- and medium-range threats, according to the IMDO.
     
            David’s Sling, a joint project of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon, uses Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to take out targets as far as 186 miles away, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS).
     
            Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States.
     
            The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the system an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.
     
            Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.
     
            Variants of the Iranian Shahab-3 series ballistic missile were used in Iran’s attack on Israel, weapons experts who analyzed verified social media videos from the scene told CNN.
     
            Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army, told CNN that fragments consistent with Shahab-3 variants such as Emad or Ghadr, were identifiable from images and videos of the attack. In one video, debris of a booster with visible markings of an Emad missile was visible, according to Ball. Different models such as the Kheibar Shekan or, less likely, a Fattah could also have been used, he added.
     
            The Shahab-3 is the foundation for all Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles using a liquid-propellant, according to Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES). “It is most likely based on a North Korean missile which itself is probably based on the Soviet-designed Scud missiles. The Shahab-3 was the first Iranian ballistic missile that could reach Israel,” he added.
     
            Remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile, including the guidance section and the warhead, were visible in images and videos collected by CNN at the site of a rocket attack at a Shalhavot Chabad School in Gedera, according to both Ball and Senft. It is difficult to identify the exact model due to the lack of reference images, Ball said.
     
        “Overall, such medium-range ballistic missiles don’t leave behind a lot of diagnostic fragments if they function as intended,” Senft added.
     
 
Hypersonic claims: Weapons experts expressed skepticism over claims that Iran used its Fattah 1 hypersonic missile for the first time during its attack on Israel.
     
            “It’s one of their newest ballistic missiles, and they have a lot to lose from using it,” Ball said. “Israel would get an idea of its capabilities just from being used. There’s also the chance it could fail to function, giving Israel an even greater idea of its capabilities. They get free propaganda and risk nothing by saying it was used.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israelis that Iran “made a big mistake” and “will pay” for launching a missile attack on the country Tuesday.
     
            “Tonight, Iran again attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles. This attack failed. It was thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defense system, which is the most advanced in the world,” Netanyahu said from a meeting with his political security cabinet, in a video released by the Israeli government’s press office on Tuesday. “I congratulate the IDF for its impressive achievement.”
     
            “It was also thwarted thanks to the vigilance and responsibility shown by you – the citizens of Israel. I also thank the United States for its support in our defense effort,” Netanyahu added.
     
            “Iran made a big mistake tonight – and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies,” he said.
     
        “We will stand by the rule we established: whoever attacks us — we will attack him.”
     
 
            Netanyahu also addressed the attack in Tel Aviv’s neighborhood of Jaffa, sending condolences to the families of those killed. “As with the missile attack, there is also a deliberate and murderous hand behind this attack – it comes from Tehran,” he said.
     
            Top officials from France, Britain, Germany and the European Union have all condemned Iran’s missile attacks on Israel, warning of potentially disastrous consequences for the wider region.
     
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced what he called an “attempt by the Iranian regime to harm innocent Israelis” and “escalate this dangerous situation” in the Middle East.
     
            The British leader was on a phone call to his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, when the Iranian attack began, according to a readout from Starmer’s office.
     
        “I am deeply concerned that the region is on the brink, and I am deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation,” Starmer said during a video statement.
     
 
            Starmer said he had used calls with Netanyahu and his Lebanese, French and Palestinian counterparts to push for a “political route forward.”
     
Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, also condemned Iran’s attack “in the strongest possible terms.”
     
            “We have urgently warned Iran against this dangerous escalation. Iran must stop the attack immediately. It is leading the region further into the abyss,” Baerbock said on X.
     
French Prime Minister Michel Barnier also weighed in on what he described as “an extremely serious situation in the Middle East.”
     
        “I am speaking … at a time when the situation is worsening in the Near and Middle East, with an escalation and an attack, and a direct conflict that seems to be underway between Iran and Israel,” Barner told lawmakers in the French parliament.
     
 
Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, warned a “dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation” is underway that risks “spiraling out of control.”
     
            The bloc is “fully committed to contribute to avert a regional war,” Borrell said, stressing that “an immediate ceasefire across the region is needed.”
     
            Tuesday’s attack by Iran on Israel could shift the scales in the already extremely tense situation in the Middle East as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tehran “will pay.”
     
            Up until now, Iran has mostly used its proxies in the region — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen — to strike against Israel.
     
            When it attacked Israel directly in April, after accusing it of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria, the assault appeared designed for effect rather than impact.
     
            Tuesday’s missile strikes seemed different.
     
            The Pentagon said the attack on Tuesday was twice as large as Iran’s last barrage against Israel in April. Tehran said the barrage was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. It came just hours after Israel announced it launched a ground operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon — something that would have been seen by Iran as a major escalation.
     
            While the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said most of the missiles were intercepted, some have landed on Israeli soil and appear to have caused damage.
     
            Unlike in the spring, when Israel had days to prepare for the attacks, it received little warning on Tuesday, learning about the imminent threat just hours before Tehran launched the barrage.
     
            Whatever Israel decides to do in response could shape the next stage of the conflict. It opted for a limited response back in April following pleas by the US and other allies to exercise restraint. But the words used by Israeli officials on Tuesday suggests the reaction might be more forceful this time.
     
        IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari called the barrage a “serious attack” and said “there will be serious consequences.” Hagari did not elaborate on what these consequences might be.
     
 
            The worry among the international community is that Israel might decide to target some of Iran’s nuclear facilities. That is something Israel didn’t do in April — possibly because it worried about how Hezbollah would react to such a forceful move. Instead, it chose to strike military defenses near these facilities. With Hezbollah greatly weakened after the recent spate of Israeli attacks targeting its top officials, that risk could now play much smaller part in Israel’s calculation.

• Iran launched a missile attack on Israel Tuesday. Sirens sounded across the country as CNN teams on the ground saw dozens of missiles over the cities of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa.
     
• An Israeli air base was hit by the Iranian attack, new videos show, while the IDF says it conducted a “large number of interceptions.” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack focused on Israeli security and military targets and was in response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others.
     
• The Israeli military — which initially estimated about 180 missiles were fired at Israel — said the attack “will have consequences.”
     
• Earlier, the US said it believed Iran was preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel, following Israel’s launch of a ground operation in southern Lebanon targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah. Israeli officials described the ground offensive in Lebanon as “localized raids.”
     
Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
 
            Iran’s military chief said the missile attack launched Tuesday was limited to military targets, but warned of broader strikes if Israel responds.
     
            Major General Mohammad Bagheri said Iran had targeted military infrastructure including the Mossad intelligence agency, the Nevatim Air Base, Hatzor Air Base, radar installations and groupings of Israeli tanks, despite having the option of launching a much broader attack.
     
            “We had the capability to attack the regime’s economic infrastructure, but we only targeted military bases,” he said Wednesday.
     
            He added a warning to Israel and its supporters.
     
            “If the Zionist regime is not controlled and takes action against Iran, we will target all of its infrastructure,” he said.
     
            Bagheri said the strikes against Israel were in retaliation for the assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and Abbas Nilforoushan.
     
            Nasrallah, who led the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for more than 30 years, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday. Nilforoushan, a senior commander from Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was killed alongside him, according to Iranian state media.
     
            Hamas political leader Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in July using an explosive device that had been covertly hidden in the guesthouse where he was staying, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.
     
            “Since the assassination of Martyr Haniyeh, we have gone through a difficult period of restraint at the repeated request of the Americans and Europeans, who asked us to hold back to establish a ceasefire in Gaza. However, after the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Commander Nilforoushan, the situation became intolerable,” Bagheri said.
     
            Israel has vowed to respond to Iran’s largest ever attack on the country, fueling fears of a further escalation of conflict in the Middle East.
     
            Iran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel on Tuesday in what Tehran said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, just hours after Israel said it had launched a “limited and localized” ground operation against the Iran-backed group in Lebanon.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. It said it intercepted many of the missiles, although some landed on the ground in Israel and the occupied West Bank.

            Israeli authorities were picking through pieces of shrapnel to identify the type of missile used in the aftermath of an attack carried out by Iran on Tuesday.
     
            CNN’s Jeremy Diamond, reporting from the site of an attack near a school in the central Israeli town of Gedera, said the impact of the strike left a wall and the windows of a second-grade classroom shattered, with significant damage seen inside.
     
            Workers and heavy machinery could be seen in the background clearing through debris around a large crater measuring around 8 feet at its deepest portion. Shrapnel pieces could also be seen laid out as they were collected for further analysis.
     
            No casualties were reported but hours before the attack, children had been attending the school.
     
            Remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile, including the guidance section and the warhead, were visible in the images and videos taken by CNN at the site of the crater, according to Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army.

            Jordan has vowed it “will not be a battleground for anyone,” after an Iranian missile attack on Israel ramped up tensions across the Middle East and compounded fears of a wider conflict.
     
            The Ministry of Interior said missile fragments had fallen in different parts of the country including the capital Amman.
     
        “Jordan’s position has always been that it will not be a battleground for anyone, protecting Jordan and its people is our number one responsibility,” Mohammad al-Momani, Minister of Government Communication, told the state-funded al-Mamlaka TV channel on Wednesday.
     
 
            Three people sustained minor injuries from falling missiles and debris, according to al-Momani. “There is material damage that is being assessed right now,” he added.
     
            State media broadcasts showed damage in several locations including one live report from Balqa governorate northwest of Amman where a reporter said a 2-meter missile fragment had landed.
     
Shelter order: In a rare move, the Jordanian military asked people to stay in their homes and put all its forces in a state of readiness. It also said it was taking “precautionary measures to build and support front-line units on the border fronts to protect the homeland.”
     
            Jordan’s Air Force intercepted Iranian missiles Tuesday, according to a Jordanian official.
     
            The Kingdom was one of the Arab countries that intercepted Iranian drones and missiles that were part of a previous attack against Israel by Iran on April 13.
     
            Israel operates a range of defensive systems to block attacks by everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.

            David’s Sling, a joint project of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon, uses Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to take out targets as far as 186 miles away, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS).
     
            Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States.
     
            The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the system an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.
     
            Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.
     
            Israel’s military is currently striking Hezbollah targets in Beirut, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            It said that details of the operation would follow.
     
            Footage on AFP and Reuters showed an explosion in the Lebanese capital within the past hour.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents to evacuate several neighborhoods and buildings in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where it suggested that strikes are planned.
     
            In a message posted to X after midnight local time, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned that the residents are located near “dangerous facilities belonging to Hezballah against which the Defense Force will act with strength shortly.”
     
            Variants of the Iranian Shahab-3 series ballistic missiles were used in the latest missile attack on Israel, weapons experts who analyzed verified social media videos from the scene told CNN.
     
            Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army, told CNN that fragments consistent with Shahab-3 variants such as Emad or Ghadr, were identifiable from images and videos of the attack. In one video, debris of a booster with visible markings of an Emad missile was visible, according to Ball. Different models such as the Kheibar Shekan or, less likely, a Fattah could also have been used, he added.
     
            The Shahab-3 is the foundation for all Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles using a liquid-propellant, according to Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES). “It is most likely based on a North Korean missile which itself is probably based on the Soviet-designed Scud missiles. The Shahab-3 was the first Iranian ballistic missile that could reach Israel,” he added.
     
            Remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile, including the guidance section and the warhead, were visible in images and videos collected by CNN at the site of a rocket attack at a Shalhavot Chabad School in Gedera, according to both Ball and Senft. It is difficult to identify the exact model due to the lack of reference images, Ball said.
     
        “Overall, such medium-range ballistic missiles don’t leave behind a lot of diagnostic fragments if they function as intended,” Senft also added.
     
 
            Regarding claims that Iran used its Fattah 1 hypersonic missile for the first time during its attack on Israel, weapons experts expressed skepticism.
     
            “It’s one of their newest ballistic missiles, and they have a lot to lose from using it,” Ball said. “Israel would get an idea of its capabilities just from being used. There’s also the chance it could fail to function, giving Israel an even greater idea of its capabilities. They get free propaganda and risk nothing by saying it was used.”
     
            The Israeli Air Force will carry out more strikes in the Middle East overnight and its operational capabilities have not been affected by Iran’s missile strikes, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            “The Air Force continues to operate fully, and tonight it will continue to strike in the Middle East powerfully, as has been happening throughout the past year,” IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said late on Tuesday night local time.
     
            The statement came after new video footage emerged showing Iranian missiles striking Nevatim air base in southern Israel.
     
            Hagari added that Israel would continue to pursue Hezbollah commanders and anyone who threatened Israeli citizens.
     
            “Iran committed a serious act tonight, pushing the Middle East towards escalation. We will act at the time and place we decide,” Hagari said.
     
            Even until a few weeks ago, some senior US officials privately believed that through its diplomatic and deterrence efforts, the US had helped to successfully thwart a large-scale Iranian attack against Israel, sources told CNN. 
 
            But Iran’s missile attacks against Israel on Tuesday marked yet another development in the Middle East that the Biden administration had hoped to avoid, but could not. Israel’s strikes in the Lebanese capital of Beirut last month that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in particular, appears to have effectively guaranteed that Iran would move ahead with its offensive against Israel.
     
            And even before Israel assassinated Nasrallah, there were some indications that Iran had grown alarmed about the degree of damage that Israel was inflicting on its most powerful and capable proxy militia in the region, according to a US military official.
     
            The US believed that Iran would intervene in the conflict if it judged that it was about to “lose” Hezbollah, according to a senior US official. The combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah had already taken hundreds of fighters off the battlefield, according to that official and another person familiar with the intelligence.
     
        “I think Nasrallah was the final straw” for Iran, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. “Strategically, it’s a combination of recognizing Hezbollah could really be in trouble and needing to restore some deterrence.”
     
 
            Hezbollah itself also remains a dangerous adversary for Israel. Even if Israel has done severe damage to Hezbollah’s command structure, the group still maintains a dangerous arsenal of military assets it could bring to bear against Israel.
     
            In a series of back-and-forth strikes across the border — including a particularly intense exchange on August 25 — Hezbollah has so far held back from using some of their more sophisticated long-range fire options, like ballistic and cruise missiles, potentially preserving them for later use, according to current and former US officials. And even though Israel has struck many of its launch sites, those officials say, others still remain.
     
            US officials have long assessed that both Iran and senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as both have exchanged fire in recent months. In April, Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel.
     
            Iran used its Fattah 1 hypersonic missile for the first time during its attack on Israel on Tuesday, according to the semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News.
     
            The Fattah is considered Iran’s first domestically produced hypersonic missile.
     
            Iran’s military unveiled the weapon last year, saying it can travel up to 15 times the speed of sound and is capable of “targeting missile defense systems.”
     
            Tuesday’s attack in Israel was a “significant escalation” by Iran with more than 200 ballistic missiles shot toward the country, the White House said Tuesday. US Navy destroyers fired roughly a dozen interceptors against the Iranian missiles
     
            Iran’s attack against Israel today was twice as large as Iran’s attack in April, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday.
     
Here’s what we know about the Biden administration’s response to the attacks:
 
White House comments on attack’s impact: 
 
Administration braced for Iran’s retaliation for weeks:
 
Inside the Situation Room meeting:

Harris also condemns attack:
 
            A video has emerged on social media which appears to show an Iranian missile exploding less than a kilometer (or 0.6 miles) northwest of the Mossad headquarters in the fringes of Tel Aviv.
     
            CNN geolocated the video and found it was filmed from a high-rise apartment building in Herzliya, less than 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the headquarters of the Israeli intelligence service.
     
            CNN geolocated another video appearing to show the impact of this missile in a nearby parking lot. The video shows a large crater, with dirt from the impact covering nearby vehicles. The crater is just a few hundred meters away from a cinema complex.
     
            CNN cannot independently confirm the intended target of the missile, or that the crater was caused by the impact seen in the video shot from the apartment. However, it is likely that this was the cause, based on the missile’s trajectory.
     
            Fifty-five people were killed and 156 were injured in Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon in the past 24 hours, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            Among the victims, 22 were killed and 47 were injured in the city of Nabatieh, the ministry said.
     
            Tuesday’s attack by Iran on Israel could shift the scales in the already extremely tense situation in the Middle East as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tehran “will pay.”
     
            Up until now, Iran has mostly used its proxies in the region — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen — to strike against Israel.
     
            When it attacked Israel directly in April, after accusing it of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria, the assault appeared designed for effect rather than impact.
     
            Tuesday’s missile strikes seemed different.
     
            The Pentagon said Iran’s attack on Tuesday was twice as large as Iran’s last barrage against Israel in April. Tehran said the barrage was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. It came just hours after Israel announced it launched “limited and localized” ground operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon — something that would have been seen by Iran as a major escalation.
     
            While the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said most of the missiles were intercepted, some have landed on Israeli soil and appear to have caused damage.
     
            Unlike in the spring, when Israel had days to prepare for the attacks, it received little warning on Tuesday, learning about the imminent threat just hours before Tehran launched the barrage.
     
            Whatever Israel decides to do in response could shape the next stage of the conflict. It opted for a limited response back in April following pleas by the US and other allies to exercise restraint. But the words used by Israeli officials on Tuesday suggests the reaction might be more forceful this time.
     
            IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari called the barrage a “serious attack” and said “there will be serious consequences.” Hagari did not elaborate on what these consequences might be.
     
        The worry among the international community is that Israel might decide to target some of Iran’s nuclear facilities. That is something Israel didn’t do in April — possibly because it worried about how Hezbollah would react to such a forceful move. Instead, it chose to strike military defenses near these facilities. With Hezbollah greatly weakened after the recent spate of Israeli attacks targeting its top officials, that risk could now play much smaller part in Israel’s calculation.
     
 
CNN’s Nic Robertson contributed to this report.
 
            Top officials from France, Britain, Germany and the European Union have all condemned Iran’s missile attacks on Israel, warning of potentially disastrous consequences for the wider region.
     
            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced what he called an “attempt by the Iranian regime to harm innocent Israelis” and “escalate this dangerous situation” in the Middle East.
     
            The British leader was on a phone call to his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, when the Iranian attack began, according to a readout from Starmer’s office.
     
        “I am deeply concerned that the region is on the brink, and I am deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation.”
     
        Starmer said during a video statement.
     
            Starmer said he had used calls with Netanyahu and his Lebanese, French and Palestinian counterparts to push for a “political route forward.”
     
            Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, also condemned Iran’s attack “in the strongest possible terms.”
     
            “We have urgently warned Iran against this dangerous escalation. Iran must stop the attack immediately. It is leading the region further into the abyss,” Baerbock said on X.
     
            French Prime Minister Michel Barnier also weighed in on what he described as “an extremely serious situation in the Middle East.”
     
        “I am speaking … at a time when the situation is worsening in the Near and Middle East, with an escalation and an attack, and a direct conflict that seems to be underway between Iran and Israel,” Barner told lawmakers in the French parliament.
     
 
             Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, warned a “dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation” is underway that risks “spiraling out of control.”
     
            The bloc is “fully committed to contribute to avert a regional war,” Borrell said, stressing that “an immediate ceasefire across the region is needed.”
     
            Two new videos show a number of Iranian missiles striking Nevatim air base in southern Israel based on geolocation analysis by CNN.
     
            Iran previously targeted the same base during a similar April 13 attack.
     
How CNN geolocation worked: The videos were filmed from Ar’arat an-Naqab, a town just south of the air base, in southern Israel’s remote Negev desert. CNN was able to geolocate the videos by matching the buildings seen in the videos to archival photos of the town and the airbase.
     
What’s seen in the videos: As the camera pans skyward, dozens of rocket trails can be seen falling toward the base. Sirens are heard wailing in the background.
     
            Then, in both videos, a single interceptor missile can be seen rising from a battery near the base before it travels out of frame.
     
            The control tower at the air base can be seen in one of the videos as the missiles begin to impact and explode. Smoke begins to rise across the area of the base, as the sound of more impacts is heard, and more explosions are seen.
     
            Without daylight, however, it’s unclear what exactly was hit at the base.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the videos, but did not immediately receive a response.
     
            After the April 13 attack, Daniel Hagari, Israeli military spokesperson, confirmed that some of the hundreds of projectiles fired at Israel did hit the base, causing minor damage to the infrastructure there, including in an area near the runway.
     
            Nevatim remained fully functional then, Hagari said at the time.
     
            At least one person was killed and several injured as Iran launched a missile attacks and Israel launched interceptors Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF),
     
            One Palestinian was killed in Jericho as a result of the attacks, the IDF’s international spokesperson Nadav Shoshani told CNN’s Jake Tapper.
     
            The hospital in Jericho, a city in the occupied West Bank, that treated the man said he had died from injuries caused by shrapnel from an interceptor missile launched by Israel to counter the attack.
     
            Shoshani said Iran’s firing of nearly 200 missiles toward Israel was an attempt to “harm and kill civilians” and risked “dragging the region into a wider escalation.”
     
            Asked if Israel would retaliate, he said, “we will choose the time and place and the way we will respond to this outrageous attack against Israeli citizens.”
     
            Two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in Tel Aviv, Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency services said.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israelis that Iran “made a big mistake” and “will pay” for launching a missile attack on the country Tuesday.
     
        “Tonight, Iran again attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles. This attack failed. It was thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defense system, which is the most advanced in the world,” Netanyahu said from a meeting with his political security cabinet, in a video released by the Israeli government’s press office. “I congratulate the IDF for its impressive achievement.”
     
 
            “It was also thwarted thanks to the vigilance and responsibility shown by you – the citizens of Israel. I also thank the United States for its support in our defense effort,” Netanyahu added.
     
        “Iran made a big mistake tonight – and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies,” he said.
     
 
            “We will stand by the rule we established: whoever attacks us — we will attack him,” he continued.
     
            Netanyahu also addressed the attack in Tel Aviv’s neighborhood of Jaffa, sending condolences to the families of those killed. “As with the missile attack, there is also a deliberate and murderous hand behind this attack – it comes from Tehran,” he said.
     
            The death toll from the Tel Aviv shooting and stabbing attack has risen to seven, after one of the wounded died from the injuries he sustained, the Tel Aviv Ichilov Medical Center said.
     
            It was initially reported that six people were killed and 12 wounded, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services said.
     
            MDA medics said they treated victims at several sites on Jerusalem Boulevard, including near train tracks, in the street, at a synagogue and in a butcher’s shop.
     
            The injured were taken to hospitals while air-raid alarms sounded in the region and throughout Israel.
     
This post has been updated to reflect a higher death toll.
 
            Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, is calling for an emergency session of the UN Security Council to “convene as soon as possible” after Iran attacked Israel with nearly 200 missiles.
     
            He told reporters at the UN Tuesday that Israel has a right to defend itself.
     
        “We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,” Danon said.
     
 
            He added that “10 million people were forced into bomb shelters” as Iran attacked. “Imagine the entire population of New York City in 10 minutes has to seek shelter. Children, babies, elderly — that’ s what happened in Israel.”
     
            Danon called Iran a “terrorist state” that had shown “its true face” to the world.
     
            Iranian officials have warned aircraft that a “near conflict zone” exists in its western and southern airspace, specifically near Iraq, Kuwait and Turkey.
     
            The notice, sent to airmen by Iran’s aviation authority Tuesday evening, urges all operators to “take military activity risk” into consideration.
     
            The warning could hit air travel across Europe and Asia, given that a number of airlines — many of them headquartered in Persian Gulf countries — travel through that airspace to fly to the Middle East and Europe.
     
            Iraq and Jordan both temporarily closed their airspace around the time the Iranian attack began on Tuesday evening.
     
            State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller would not say whether Iran’s nuclear program is a legitimate target for Israeli retaliation after the Iranian missile attack, saying, again, the US plans to “discuss those consequences with our Israeli counterparts before we talk about them publicly.
     
        “This is not to say I’m ruling anything out and that I’m ruling anything in, but I would answer any question this way, which is, we want to have these conversations directly with our Israeli counterparts over the coming days,” he said in response to a question from CNN.
     
 
            Miller echoed National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in stating the US will coordinate with Israel on its response to the attack on Israel, calling it “a significant escalation.” He also pledged that there would be consequences.
     
        “Of course there must be consequences for Iran for this attack. We’ve made clear that there must be consequences. I’m not going to get into what those consequences are today, but they are things on which we will be coordinating with our Israeli counterparts,” Miller said at a press briefing Tuesday.
     
 
            He said the missile attack was defeated in part due to coordination between the US, Israel and partners. Miller did not specify which other countries.
     
            Asked if Israel has done anything escalatory in the past weeks, Miller argued Israel “certainly” has “done things to expand the conflict, but if you look at the actions they have taken, they were bringing terrorists to justice.”
     
            Israel last week assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a major strike on Beirut.
     
            By contrast, he said that today “Iran came to the defense of a terrorist organization.”
     
        “If you look at what Iran did today — we have been warning for some time about the threat posed by Iran arming and funding terrorist groups across the Middle East, and the attack today just demonstrated the danger of those actions,” Miller said.
     
 
        “What you saw was Iran launching a state on state attack to protect and defend the terrorist groups that it has built, nurtured and that it controls. So there is a difference,” Miller said Tuesday.
     
 
            Miller also said “this wave of the attack is over,” adding that he does not mean other waves are coming. The US view is that it would be “incredibly escalatory” if Iran were to carry out further strikes in Israel.
     
            Iran’s attack against Israel today was twice as large as Iran’s attack in April, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday.
     
        “[I]t’s about twice as large in terms of the number of ballistic missiles that they launched from the last,” he said, adding that you “don’t launch that many missiles at a target without the intent of hitting something.”
     
 
            “So absolutely, just like the last time their intent is to cause destruction,” he said.
     
            Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said its missile strike on Israel was in defense of Iran’s interests and citizens, warning on X that the operation on Tuesday was “only a portion of our power.”
     
            “This action was in defense of the interests and citizens of Iran. To let (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu know that Iran is not belligerent, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
     
            In a message posted on X, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned in Hebrew that the “blows” against Israel would become “stronger and more painful.”
     
            “With God’s help, the blows of the uprising front will become stronger and more painful on the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime,” he said.
     
            The barrage comes after Israel launched a ground operation across its northern border into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Israel killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike last Friday and decimated the leadership of the most powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East — ratcheting up fears of a new regional war.
     
            About 6,000 Americans have reached out to the US State Department for further information about potentially departing Lebanon, spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday.
     
            Not all of those who have registered on the form are actively seeking assistance to leave the country that is under increasing Israeli assault.
     
            The US is “working with airlines to provide additional flights with more seats for American citizens, and it’s something that we hope to turn on in the next few days,” Miller said.
     
        “As we often do in these situations, we have directed US citizens who are in Lebanon to register with the State Department for information, and especially for information with how to depart Lebanon, and we’re providing them whatever information we can,” Miller said at a State Department briefing.
     
 
            “People are just looking for information. They’re looking for options. There are a number of American citizens who live in Lebanon who have lived there for years and may not want to depart the country,” he added.
     
            Miller said Monday that the US is “not evacuating American citizens from Lebanon at this time.”
     
            “We always conduct a prudent planning process. We have been doing that for some months, going all the way back to October 7. But at this time, there’s still commercial options available,” he said.
     
            He reiterated on Tuesday that Beirut’s airport is still open as he outlined efforts to get more seats for Americans.
     
            Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it targeted three Israeli military bases around Tel Aviv during a wave of missile launches Tuesday, according to the semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News.
     
            The Israeli military has initially estimated that Iran fired about 180 missiles.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Iranian missile attack against Israel “totally unacceptable” and added that the “entire world should condemn it.”
     
            Blinken said this attack included “some 200 ballistic missiles.” Israel initially estimated that 180 missiles were launched at the country.
     
            Israel “effectively defeated this attack,” Blinken added.
     
            Blinken was speaking at the State Department ahead of a meeting with the Indian external affairs minister.
     
            US Navy destroyers fired roughly a dozen interceptors against Iranian missiles that were launched toward Israel on Tuesday, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday.
     
            The US currently has three guided-missile destroyers operating in the eastern Mediterranean: USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole and USS Bulkeley. According to Ryder, the destroyers involved were the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole.
     
            Ryder also said US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke a second time on Tuesday with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, after speaking with him before Iran’s attack.
     
        “He reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel and underscored that the US remains well postured throughout the Middle East region to protect US forces and defend Israel in the fact of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations,” Ryder said.
     
 
            US destroyers also took part in intercepting Iran’s barrage of ballistic missiles and drones on April 13, shooting down several of the missiles launched at Israel.
     
This post has been updated with additional details from the Pentagon’s spokesperson.  
 
            Hamas praised the launch of Iranian missiles toward Israel on Tuesday, saying they avenged the deaths of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Abbas Nilforoushan, a senior commander in Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
     
            Those three figures have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent weeks and days, tipping the region closer toward a multi-front conflict.
     
            “We affirm that this honorable Iranian response is a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government, on the path to deterring them and curbing their terrorism, as their crimes, arrogance, and violations of international laws and humanitarian norms have exceeded all limits,” Hamas said in a statement.
     
Some context: Israel has been engaged in a war against the militant group in Gaza since Hamas’ attacks on October 7 last year.
     
            Iran-backed Hezbollah has meanwhile exchanged tit-for-tat attacks on Israel’s northern border since the same date, in solidarity with Hamas, and those confrontations have escalated in recent weeks.
     
            Israel will carry out a “significant response” to Iran’s attack, an Israeli official told CNN Tuesday.
     
        “What Iran has suffered so far is only a promo,” the official said.
     
 
            Those warnings echoed the message from Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, who said in a televised message on Tuesday that “this attack will have consequences.”
     
            “We have plans, and we will operate at the place and time we decide,” Hagari said.
     
            The barrage of missiles fired at Israel on Tuesday evening caused citizens to rush to cover, but the Israeli military has said that no new attacks have been identified and it is safe for people to leave their shelters.
     
            Jordan’s military said in a statement that all units and formations in its armed forces’ general command have been put on “on high alert to confront any attempts that threaten the security and stability of the kingdom.”
     
            Citing a military source in the armed forces general command, the statement added:
     
        “The General Command is closely monitoring the developments occurring in the region and has taken necessary precautionary measures to build and support front-line units on the border fronts to protect the homeland.”
     
 
            Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on Tuesday in response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
     
            Earlier on Tuesday, the US said it believed that a ballistic missile attack on Israel was imminent after Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon.
     
Here’s what we know about the attack so far: 
 
Over 100 missiles launched: The Israeli military estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles,” but stressed that it was not the final count. CNN teams saw dozens of missiles over the cities of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. CNN’s Jim Sciutto said he saw multiple missiles intercepted. Meanwhile, Jordan’s military said in a statement that “hundreds of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel,” citing a military source in its armed forces general command. Some Iranian missiles made direct impact in central and southern Israel, an Israeli military spokesperson said.
     
No injuries reported as people bunkered: Sirens blared in Israel as people were told to bunker as the missiles came down, including the Israeli security cabinet, according to an Israeli source. There were no injuries following Iran’s attack, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said.
     
Warnings of escalation: The Iranian Mission to the United Nations said Tuesday afternoon that Tehran’s response has “been duly carried out” and if Israel should “dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.” An Israeli military spokesperson said “there will be serious consequences.”
 
US support: A US defense official said that US forces in the Middle East were “defending against Iranian-launched missiles targeting Israel.” Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were in the Situation Room at the White House monitoring the attack. The president “directed the US military to aid Israel’s defense against Iranian attacks & shoot down missiles targeting Israel,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have also been briefed on the attack, according to their respective spokespeople. 
 
            Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel has not identified any additional aerial threats from Iran at this stage.
     
            “You may leave the protected spaces, and should continue to follow the Home Front Command’s guidelines. I ask you to continue demonstrating responsibility and to be alert,” Hagari told Israeli people in a televised statement on Tuesday.
     
            The Israeli military’s initial estimate is that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at Israel.
     
            “At this moment, we understand it was approximately 180 projectiles,” an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told CNN. “But this is not final, and (is) an initial estimate.”
     
            Israel has plans to retaliate in response to Iran’s missile attack, the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said Tuesday.
     
        “This attack will have consequences,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement. “We have plans, and we will operate at the place and time we decide.”
     
 
            Some Iranian missiles fired at Israel Tuesday night made direct impact in central and southern Israel, the Israeli military spokesperson said.
     
            “We carried out many interceptions,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement. “There are a few impacts in the center and some more in the south. At this stage, we are assessing the situation. We are not aware of injuries.”
     
            People across Israel have sought shelter as a barrage of missiles were fired at the country from Iran on Tuesday night.
     
Here’s what it looked like across the country:
 
            There were no injuries following Iran’s attack on Israel on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari has said.
     
            “There was a serious attack on us, and there will be serious consequences,” Hagari said Tuesday.
     
            He added this was not the first time Israel had faced a threat from Iran.
     
        “We are ready for them,” he said.
     
 
            CNN’s team in the Lebanese capital of Beirut heard celebratory gunfire and fireworks on Tuesday evening as word spread of Iran’s huge missile attack on Israel.
     
            Meanwhile, over on Israel’s other front, videos filmed by a CNN stringer in Gaza captured audible cheering as Iranian rockets flew overhead en route to Israel.
     
            Jordan’s military said in a statement that “hundreds of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel,” citing a military source in its armed forces general command.
     
            The country’s armed forces has called on citizens to remain at home “for their safety and the safety of their families,” the statement added.
     
            Jordan’s Air Force has been active in intercepting Iranian missiles tonight, according to an official from the country.
     
CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed reporting. 
 
            A US defense official says that US forces in the Middle East “are currently defending against Iranian-launched missiles targeting Israel.”
     
            The US has positioned an array of assets in the region that are capable of intercepting missiles, including destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, a carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea, and fighter jet squadrons. It is not yet clear which assets engaged the missiles or how many were intercepted by the US.
     
            Israeli officials are urging residents in the northern municipality of Safed to remain in protected areas until further notice, warning of the potential of falling fragments from intercepted projectiles.
     
            Six civilians were killed and nine were wounded in a shooting and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Israeli police said, revising the previous death toll of eight.
     
            Two attackers were “neutralized” by authorities and civilians at the scene using personal pistols, police added. Police earlier described the attackers as apparent “terrorists.”
     
            Israel’s national emergency service says it happened near a light rail station in Jaffa.
     
This post has been updated with the revised death toll and details from Israeli police. 
 
            US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are in the Situation Room at the White House “monitoring the Iranian attack against Israel,” National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett posted on X.
     
            Savett wrote that Biden and Harris are receiving updates from their national security team. The president “directed the US military to aid Israel’s defense against Iranian attacks & shoot down missiles targeting Israel,” he added.
     
            The Iranian Mission to the United Nations said Tuesday afternoon that Tehran’s response has “been duly carried out,” following a barrage of missiles launched at Israel.
     
            “Iran’s legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime—which involved targeting Iranian nationals and interests and infringing upon the national sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran—has been duly carried out,” the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations said in a post on X.
 
            The mission said that if Israel should “dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”
     
            The mission added that “regional states and the Zionists’ supporters are advised to part ways with the regime.”
     
            Iran launched missile strikes from locations across the country, including Tabriz, Kashan, and the outskirts of Tehran, late Tuesday night local time.
     
            Social media platforms were inundated with videos that captured dramatic scenes of rocket fire illuminating the Iranian skyline.
     
            Earlier Tuesday, the US had warned of a forthcoming attack from Iran against Israel.
     
            The Israeli security cabinet is in an emergency bunker in Jerusalem, according to an Israeli source.
     
            CNN teams on the ground in Israel have counted dozens of missiles flying above Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa in the past hour.
     
            CNN’s Jim Sciutto is in a shelter in Tel Aviv.
     
            Speaking to CNN, he said that the US believed two air bases and Mossad headquarters would be targeted by Iran this evening. But, he reported seeing impacts in Tel Aviv.
     
            “I did see impacts. I saw two impacts close to the hotel here and I saw another one further north of here, I might guess a couple of miles where I did see some fire and explosion,” Sciutto said.
     
            He added that he saw multiple intercepts over him in Tel Aviv and an impact on the Tel Aviv shoreline. Sciutto said that it’s unclear whether the impacts were the missiles themselves striking, fragments of missiles that have been intercepted or perhaps some of the interceptor missiles themselves coming down. He went on to say the speed and trajectory were forceful.
     
            We’ll bring you more details as we get them.
     
            Iran said it targeted Israel on Tuesday in response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency, citing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
     
            “In response to the martyrdom of Martyr Haniyeh, Seyed Hassan Nasrallah and Martyr Nilfroshan, we targeted the heart of the occupied territories,” it said.
     
            “If the Zionist regime reacts to Iran’s operations, it will face crushing attacks,” IRGC also said, according to Tasnim.
     
            The IRGC said that its aerospace forces “targeted important military with security targets by launching dozens of ballistic missiles” at Israel.
     
            It added in a statement that details of its missile attack on Israel “will be conveyed at a later time” and the operation was carried out with the support “of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army and the Ministry of Defense.”
     
            CNN teams in Israel, Jerusalem and Haifa have counted dozens of missiles flying above them.
     
            Several have been intercepted, but it’s unclear how many.
     
            US President Joe Biden convened a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris and top national security officials on Tuesday to discuss the expected ballistic missile attack by Iran on Israel, according to White House spokesperson Emilie Simons.
     
            ”.@POTUS  just convened a meeting with @VP and their natsec team to discuss Iranian plans to imminently launch a significant ballistic missile attack against Israel. They reviewed the status of U.S. preparations to help Israel defend against attacks and protect U.S. personnel,” Simons posted on X.
     
Biden also posted on X and said that he and Harris had met with the national security team earlier today “to discuss Iranian plans to launch an imminent missile attack against Israel. We discussed how the United States is prepared to help Israel defend against these attacks, and protect American personnel in the region.”
     
            CNN’s Jeremy Diamond is in northern Israel as Iranian missiles fly over the country.
     
            Diamond added that tonight’s missiles could be an escalation of what was seen in April.
     
            CNN cameras also captured at least a dozen missiles fly over Tel Aviv.
     
            Sirens blared as CNN’s Jim Sciutto spoke in Tel Aviv. At one point, a missile landed near where Sciutto was reporting, and he sought cover with his team.
     
            Missiles have been launched from Iran to Israel, according to an Israel Defense Forces statement.
     
            Sirens are sounding across Israel, it said.
     
            Turkey is readying to evacuate its citizens and nationals from nearly 20 other countries from Lebanon as the conflict with Israel intensifies further.
     
            The Turkish foreign ministry warned there is a “possibility that the security situation in Lebanon will worsen further” in a Tuesday statement.
     
            “Plans were prepared for the evacuation of our citizens by sea or air,” the ministry said. Preparations for this evacuation effort are “continuing” for both Turkish citizens and nationals from nearly “20 countries that have requested support so far,” it added.
     
            Turkey strongly condemned Israel’s ground operations in Lebanon, calling it “an illegal invasion attempt” in an earlier statement on Tuesday.
     
            Ankara warned that the offensive “targets the security and stability of the region and beyond” and is likely to “spark a new wave of migration.”
     
            “This attack must come to an end immediately,” the Turkish foreign ministry stressed.
     
            Israel assesses that Iran is likely to attack three Israeli air bases and an intelligence base located just north of Tel Aviv, a person briefed on the matter said.
     
            The intelligence base in Glilot was evacuated Tuesday afternoon, the source said, and the Israeli military has put contingency plans for the safety of personnel at those bases into effect.
     
            The United States warned Israel that an attack would likely come within the next 12 hours, the person said.
     
            A US military official also said potential Iranian targets in Israel include air bases and intelligence command centers.
     
            The US is supporting and coordinating with Israel on air defense. It is not coordinating or supporting on Lebanon ground operations.
     
            Both Israel and the United States are engaged in significant diplomatic efforts to head off the Iranian attack, although it is not clear how successful those efforts will be.
     
            United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres “is extremely concerned with the escalation of the conflict in Lebanon” and is appealing for an immediate ceasefire, according to a statement from his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.
     
            The statement warned that an “all-out war must be avoided in Lebanon at all costs.”
     
            Guterres spoke with Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Tuesday morning, according to Dujarric, and the UN system in Lebanon was mobilized to assist across the country.
     
            “The Secretary-General will continue his contacts, and his representatives on the ground will also continue their efforts to de-escalate the situation,” the statement said.
     
            The word “limited” is going to have to do a lot of work in the weeks ahead.
     
            Israel has described its initial ground incursion into southern Lebanon as such, although its key ally, US President Joe Biden’s administration, has already suggested that what may initially begin as small in scope could risk dragging on.
     
            It will take a remarkable amount of efficiency and discipline from the Israeli military and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to know when it is time to stop. Militaries are not particularly keen on pulling back, especially in large scale operations. If the incursion is easygoing, it could incentivize the Israel Defense Forces to push forward, sensing a weakened enemy against which swift progress can be made. If the going gets tough, the IDF can suggest the mission is more imperative than ever, and that they must push on.
     
            But, quite remarkably after two weeks of technological wizardry and ruthless, calculated attacks against Hezbollah — starting with the simultaneous explosion of communication devices and culminating in the killing of the militant group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah — the playing field may shift. The Israeli military are now walking into the ground trap that their adversary has been setting for them for well over a decade.
     
            They may discover that Hezbollah, its leadership decapitated, is so enfeebled that it is genuinely a less challenging task than imagined to mop up what remains of its ground troops after months of heavy airstrikes. But southern Lebanon was always going to be where the Iran-backed group held the home advantage. Its tunnel network provides them an endless maze for Israeli forces. And so, knowing when to stop is going to be key to this not becoming a quagmire for Israel. Almost every modern war that has dragged on for years began with the idea that it would all be over in a matter of weeks.
     
            A potential ballistic missile attack by Iran on Israel could “cost the regime its head,” an Iran expert said, especially if the attack is carried out as a last-ditch effort to save face.
     
            “Resorting to another direct missile attack on Israel would mean the regime (in Tehran) sees itself in more dire straits that Iranian officials acknowledge,” Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank in Washington, DC, told CNN. He added that an attack could “easily beget a larger regional war” as Israel would likely respond much more forcefully than it did in April, when Iran fired an onslaught of drones and missiles toward Israel.
     
        “A missile strike merely for the purpose of saving face could easily end up costing the regime its head,” Ben Taleblu said.
     
 
            The White House on Tuesday said the United States believes Iran is preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel, and Washington is actively preparing to support Israel against such an attack. The US also warned that an attack of the kind would “carry severe consequences for Iran.”
     
            Ben Taleblu said that should an Iranian attack take place, much of the region’s fate would hinge on how Washington responds, “which has been essentially absent from the past few game-changing weeks in the Middle East.” He also noted that Iran has the largest missile arsenal in the region.
     
            Following warnings from the United States that Iran is planning an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel, an Israeli source told CNN that intense diplomacy is happening behind the scenes.
     
            According to the source, the assessment is that an attack will happen shortly. Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had not yet identified an aerial threat from Iran.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on his country to “stand together” and follow the directions of emergency services.
     
            The US warned Israel early Tuesday morning ET (midday Israel time) that Iran was poised to launch an attack, according to a person familiar with the matter.
     
            The warning between the two countries came several hours before the White House announced publicly that it had indications Iran was preparing for a ballistic missile attack against Israel.
     
            The official said Iran has been postured to move quickly in an attack on Israel. After an onslaught of drones and missiles fired toward Israel in April, many of Iran’s assets remained in position.
     
            Hezbollah said it targeted Tel Aviv earlier Tuesday morning with a barrage of rockets aimed at the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, as well as the base housing an Israeli intelligence unit.
     
            Two people also sustained injuries when their vehicles were hit on a highway north of Kfar Qassim in central Israel, following strikes launched from Lebanon, Israel’s military said.
     
            A 54-year-old bus driver sustained moderate head and back injuries from shrapnel when his bus carrying 10 passengers was hit. And a 31-year-old man is being treated for light injuries after his car was impacted by the strike.
     
            An Israeli security official told reporters earlier that sirens were activated across central Israel after a number of projectiles were fired from Lebanon, “sending millions of people into bomb shelters.”
     
            Hezbollah said it used Fadi-4 rockets in the attack, which it described as a long-range surface-to-surface missile, which is part of a series of rockets that the group started using recently to strike deeper into Israel.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Israelis to “stand together” and continue following frontline commands as fears of an imminent attack from Iran grow.
     
            Earlier on Tuesday, the United States warned that it believes Tehran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.
     
            In a statement, Netanyahu said Israel is in the throes of a “campaign against Iran’s axis of evil” and made specific demands from the Israeli public.
     
        “What I ask of you is two things: One - to strictly obey the directives of the frontline command, it saves lives. And second - to stand together,” Netanyahu said in a statement.
     
 
            The top spokesperson for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, made a similar request to Israelis Tuesday, calling on the public to “continue acting responsibly.”
     
            Hagari asked Israelis to “adhere” to new directives issued by the Home Front Command on Tuesday, imposing restrictions on gatherings and protection of spaces in Jerusalem and other designated areas.
     
            The US Embassy in Israel has directed all US government personnel and family members “to shelter in place until further notice” because of “the current security situation,” it said in an alert Tuesday.
     
            “This is provided for your information as you make your own security plans,” the alert said. It was issued as the White House said it believes Iran is preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel.
     
            The alert does not make specific mention of that threat. Under the State Department’s “no double standard” policy, if the department “shares information with the official US community” — such as embassy personnel — it must share “the same or similar” information with the US citizens in that country “if the underlying threat applies to both official and non-official U.S. citizens/nationals.”
     
            The Israeli military said it had not yet identified an aerial threat from Iran, after the US said it believed Tehran was preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.
     
        “As of this moment, Israel does not perceive imminent threat from Iran,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Tuesday.
     
 
            During a short video message, Hagari said Israeli military planes are currently “scanning the sky” for any imminent threat from Iran.
     
            “We are on peak alert both on the offensive and the defensive,” Hagari added, warning Iran that any attack on Israel would “have consequences.”
     
            The US anticipates that the forthcoming attack from Iran against Israel could be similar in scope and scale to the one in April, a US official tells CNN.
     
            In that attack, Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles toward Israel  in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria.
     
            More than 300 projectiles — including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles — were fired toward Israel in the April attack, but “99%” of them were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense systems and its “partners,” according to the Israeli military.
     
            Israeli troops faced no resistance from Hezbollah as they pushed into a Lebanese border village on Monday night, according to an Israeli military source.
     
            The source said Israeli special forces had previously conducted raids into Kfarkela, on the northern tip of Israel’s border with Lebanon, where they discovered Hezbollah offensive lines that the Israeli military believed could be used to infiltrate Israel.
     
            The ground operation came after Israeli special forces carried out more than 70 missions inside Lebanon, spanning back to November. During those operations, many of which were overnight missions, forces of 20 to 30 special operators destroyed thousands of Hezbollah sites – including tunnels and weapons depots – and gathered intelligence on the militant group’s positions along the border.
     
            The operations spanned hundreds of days inside Lebanon in total, the source said.
     
            Israeli forces faced zero resistance from Hezbollah during the course of those operations, engaging in no firefights. The Israeli military source could not explain why Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force did not defend its border assets, which the Israeli military says were meant to be used to infiltrate Israeli territory.
     
            The Israeli military believes that a larger ground operation will be able to discover and dismantle more Hezbollah infrastructure than smaller-scale special operations raids – and do so at a faster pace.
     
            A senior White House official says the US believes Iran is preparing to “imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.”
     
            “The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel,” a full statement reads.
     
        “We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran,” it continued. 
     
 
            The US is prepared to do whatever it can to help Israel intercept anything Iran directs its way, a US official told CNN. Those efforts would be similar to how the US offered its assistance in April, when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles toward Israel – the vast majority of which were successfully intercepted.
     
            It was not immediately clear the scale of attack the US anticipated Iran to launch against Israel this time around.
     
            Israel has been conducting cross-border raids inside Lebanon since the start of the war last October, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday, after the IDF launched what it called a “limited and localized” ground operation in Lebanon.
     
            “In the past day, IDF started an operation in the area close to the border. This is an additional action to what we already do in Lebanon,” Hagari said in a briefing.
     
            He said Israeli troops have been conducting raids for months in an attempt to dismantle what the IDF described as “Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure that pose a threat to Israeli civilian communities in northern Israel.”
     
        “Our soldiers entered Lebanon dozens of times. They entered villages. They revealed tunnels and collected intelligence. They destroyed infrastructure and weapons. They revealed and destroyed more than 700 sites,” Hagari said.
     
 
            He said the IDF found tunnels built under houses in villages along the border. CNN cannot independently verify these claims.
     
            Hagari listed several villages on the Lebanese side of the border where he said Hezbollah constructed tunnels and stored weapons.
     
            Separately, the IDF published a list of locations where it said it had found weapons.
     
            Hezbollah has rejected claims that Israeli forces had entered southern Lebanon Tuesday, describing them as “lies.”
 
            Hezbollah’s attempts to “infiltrate Israel” from the north, in violation of a 2006 United Nations resolution, are among the reasons for the “limited” ground operation Israel launched into Lebanon overnight, an Israeli security official said.
     
            Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official argued that Hezbollah has been violating the 2006 UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for a permanent ceasefire and an end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel.
     
        “We’ve seen attempts of Hezbollah to infiltrate Israel. In some cases, one of our brigades deputy commanders was killed, and this is something that they have (been) planning for years. These extensive strongholds on the Israeli border pose a clear and direct threat to Israel’s civilians. They constitute a blatant violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which forbids non governmental forces south of the Litani River,” the official said.
     
 
            The official said that in launching the ground operation, Israel is “trying to make sure that we create a reality where residents can return to northern Israel, and for the last year, we’ve been calling the international community to act against this clear violation of Resolution 1701 by Hezbollah.”
     
What does the resolution say? It stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw north of the Litani River in Lebanon, and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area.
     
            The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said in a statement earlier that the Israeli military informed it on Monday of its intention to “undertake limited ground incursions into Lebanon.”
     
            The UN peacekeeping force urged de-escalation and stressed that any Israeli operation inside Lebanon would be a violation of the 1701 Resolution.
     
        “Any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a violation of Resolution 1701. We urge all actors to step back from such escalatory acts, which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed,” UNIFIL added.
     
 
            Hezbollah rejected claims that Israeli forces had entered southern Lebanon, describing them as “lies.”
     
            “All Zionist claims that occupation forces entered Lebanon are false,” a statement by Hezbollah spokesman Mohamed Afif said on Tuesday.
     
            Fighters from the Iran-aligned militant group have not yet directly clashed with Israeli ground forces, according to Afif who said Hezbollah is ready for a “direct confrontation if the enemy dared to enter Lebanese territory.”
     
            His comments were made to Al Jazeera and posted on Hezbollah social media channels.
     
            The Israeli military has called for residents in more than two dozen villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate approximately 30 miles into the country.
     
            “You must immediately move to the north of the Al-Awali River. Save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X.
     
            The Al-Awali River is about 30 miles north of some of the southern Lebanese villages that Israel urged residents to leave.
     
            The warnings come as Israel launches what it says is “a limited ground operation” and “localized raids” in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. Israeli forces have not yet launched a full-scale invasion into southern Lebanon, three sources told CNN earlier.
     
            “Anyone in close proximity to Hezbollah members, their facilities, or their combat equipment is putting their life at risk. Any house used by Hezbollah for military purposes is expected to be targeted,” Adraee said.
     
            In an earlier post, the Israeli military spokesperson called on residents not to travel “using vehicles” north of the Litani River towards southern Lebanon.
     
            An unspecified number of troops in the US have been put on prepare to deploy orders, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday.
     
        “Secretary Austin increased the readiness of additional US forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies,” she said. “I’m just not going to get into specifics for [operational security] reasons, but these forces cover a wide range of capabilities and missions.”
     
 
            Singh also said that additional air defense support going to the region, announced by the Pentagon on Sunday, are units previously scheduled to deploy that will now be joining units already there instead of replacing them.
     
            The reinforcement of air support capabilities, she said, includes “a certain number of units already deployed to the Middle East region that will be extended, and the forces due to rotate into theater to replace them will now instead augment the in-place forces already in the region.” It will include “an additional few thousand” service members in the region, she said.
     
            “I can tell you these augmented forces include F-16, F-15E, A-10, F-22 fighter aircraft and associated personnel,” Singh said.
     
            The Israeli military informed United Nations peacekeeping forces on Monday of its intention to “undertake limited ground incursions into Lebanon,” a statement by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said.
     
            The peacekeeping forces will remain in position and have contingency plans ready to be activated “if absolutely necessary,” the UNIFIL said.
     
            “Any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a violation of resolution 1701. We urge all actors to step back from such escalatory acts, which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed,” it added.
     
            Resolution 1701 is the 2006 Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a permanent ceasefire and end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution also stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw north of the Litani River in Lebanon, and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area.
     
            “The price of continuing the current course of action is too high,” the UNIFIL statement said.
     
            “Civilians must be protected, civilian infrastructure must not be targeted and International law must be respected.”
     
If you’re just joining our coverage, here’s what we know about Israel’s incursion into Lebanon:
 
            Israeli officials have characterized the incursion into southern Lebanon as limited in scope, saying there will be “no long-term occupation.”
     
            Even sources in Lebanon have said that Israel has not yet launched a full-scale invasion, with  another source at the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) saying the military staged some “sporadic raids” across the border.
     
            But Israeli officials have declined to say how deep troops would venture into the country or how long the operation is expected to last.
     
            Previous military operations initially declared by Israel to be limited in their goals have proved to be anything but. Examples include Israel’s years-long occupation of southern Lebanon that began in 1982 with the stated aim of a brief and limited mission to destroy the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
     
            More recently, Israel’s military declared a “limited” operation in Rafah, southern Gaza that has left the city in ruins.
     
Why is Israel attacking Lebanon? 
 
            Israel has stepped up strikes on various targets across Lebanon since Thursday September 19 in a series of attacks that have left hundreds of civilians dead and injured, and displaced at least 1 million people across the country.
     
            Israel’s stated war goal is to “ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday, and its military has also said it is striking Hezbollah targets, particularly across southern Lebanon and Beirut.
     
            The ground operation that the Israeli military launched overnight into southern Lebanon does not amount to an invasion or incursion, an Israeli security official said, describing it instead as “localized raids” that are “very limited in scope and in the area of operation.”
     
            The official said there were so far “no clashes” on the ground between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah.
     
            Speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity Tuesday morning, the official refused to comment on whether Israeli tanks have entered Lebanon and would not elaborate on how deep into Lebanese territory Israeli troops have advanced, saying they were focused on the border areas.
     
            CNN cannot independently verify the extent of Israel’s operation in Lebanon or the types of forces on the ground there.
     
            The IDF has been building up its presence along Israel’s northern border for weeks, redeploying some units that had previously fought in Gaza to Israel’s northern border area.
     
            The security official said the forces that have entered are “not numbers of a large ground invasion.”
     
        “The amount of forces and the type of forces are more appropriate to something of a limited raid, and not, for example, things we’ve seen in Gaza with very, very large forces,” the official said.
     
 
            The official also pushed back against suggestions that Israel has begun an invasion of Lebanon, criticizing media reports that called the operation “an incursion” that is “going to Beirut.”
     
        “That is not on the table. We’re talking about limited, localized, targeted raids based on precise intelligence in areas near the border.”
     
 
            Two people sustained moderate to light injuries when their vehicles were hit on Highway 6, north of Kfar Qassim in central Israel, following strikes launched from Lebanon, Israel’s military said.
     
            A 54-year-old bus driver sustained moderate head and back injuries from shrapnel when his bus carrying 10 passengers was hit. And a 31-year-old man is being treated for light injuries when his car was impacted by the strike.
     
            An Israeli security official told reporters sirens had been activated across central Israel.
     
            “A number of projectiles, these are from Lebanon, have been fired towards Israel, sending millions of people into bomb shelters just a few minutes ago. I can tell you multiple rockets towards central Israel, multiple locations,” he added.
     
            Israeli police issued a warning for drivers to avoid Highway 6, which has been closed “due to damage from strikes.”
     
            Police officers and bomb disposal units “are now working to isolate fall scenes in the station sectors and are scanning for remains and other items in order to remove another risk to the public,” according to Israel’s first response service, MDA.
     
            The Israeli military has staged some “sporadic raids” across the Lebanon-Israel border but its troops have not remained on Lebanese soil, a source from the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said.
     
            The assessment that Israel has not yet launched a full-scale invasion was supported by two other high-level Lebanese security sources.
     
            The Iran-aligned Houthi militant group in Yemen has fired drones targeting Israel in support of their ally Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            The Houthis said the drones targeted Jaffa near Tel Aviv and Eilat in southern Israel with five drones. Israel has not commented on the Houthi claim, and it is unclear if there was any damage or injuries.
     
        “In support of the Palestinian and Lebanese people and in solidarity with the courageous Palestinian and Lebanese resistance, the Yemeni Armed Forces’ drone unit targeted an Israeli military site in the occupied Yafa area with a Yafa-type drone and targeted military sites in the Um Al-Rashrash/Eilat area with four Samad-4 drones. By the grace of God, both operations successfully achieved their objectives,” Houthi military spokesman Yahya Al Saree said.
     
 
            On Monday, Israel’s military struck what it said were power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis in Yemen, killing at least four people and wounding dozens more. The Houthis, like Hamas and Hezbollah, are among the Iran-backed militant groups who have been battling Israel since the war in Gaza began last October.
     
            While the Houthis do not pose as much of a threat to Israel as Hamas and Hezbollah, they have wreaked havoc over the past year in the Red Sea, where they have launched strikes at commercial ships they deemed linked to Israel and its allies, threatening to choke global trade.
     
            Deadly fighting between Israel and Iran-backed militant groups has ramped up in recent weeks as the Israeli military expands its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
     
            Along with Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah and the Houthis are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” an alliance of Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen. The proxies give Iran strategic depth against its enemies.
     
            In support of Hamas and Palestinians, Hezbollah and the Houthis have launched regular attacks on Israel over the past year. They have vowed to keep fighting until the war in Gaza ends.
     
Here’s what to know about the groups:
 
Hezbollah: The Lebanese group is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. The Shiite group emerged out of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years before it was driven out by Hezbollah. In 2006, Hezbollah and Israel fought a war for 34 days, which ended with no clear victor.
     
The Houthis: The Shiite group, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology, has been fighting Saudi-backed forces for more than a decade in Yemen’s civil war. While the Houthis do not pose as much of a threat to Israel as Hamas and Hezbollah, they have wreaked havoc over the past year in the Red Sea, where they have launched strikes at commercial ships they deemed linked to Israel and its allies, threatening to choke global trade.
     
Hamas: The group emerged in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist group from Egypt. Hamas considers Israel’s existence as illegitimate and seeks its destruction. It receives funding, weapons and training from Iran.
     
            The US has designated Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations.
     
Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the length of Israel’s occupation in southern Lebanon. It was 18 years. The description of the goals of Hamas has also been updated to more accurately convey their meaning.
 
            Lebanon’s army on Tuesday denied reports it had withdrawn from southern border positions by several kilometers following Israel’s ground incursion into the country.
     
            Such reports were inaccurate, the Army Command said.
     
        “(Lebanese) military units deployed in the south are repositioning certain forward observation points within their designated areas of responsibility,” it said, adding that the army continues to coordinate with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.
     
 
            CNN is unable to independently verify the Lebanese army’s movements.
     
            Prior to Israel’s incursion, a Lebanese security source told CNN on Monday that Lebanon’s army had evacuated observation posts at the southern border and moved to barracks in border villages.
     
            “Limited” is a subjective word. What Israel sees as a “targeted and limited ground operation” in southern Lebanese villages may look anything but to civilians on the ground.
     
            The most recent use of that word by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) should offer little comfort to the non-Hezbollah population of Lebanon.
     
            On May 6, Israeli forces launched what they called a “limited” offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to target Hamas, in defiance of significant international opposition. Israel claims it dismantled the militant group’s Rafah Brigade and destroyed tunnel networks.
     
            Around 1 million Palestinian civilians, many already displaced, fled the city. Much of what is left of Rafah has been described as unrecognizable by foreign media, including CNN, who were shown the aftermath by the IDF.
     
            “Limited” has been used to describe incursions into Lebanon before.
     
            In 1982, Israel described its invasion of southern Lebanon as “limited”. What followed was a bloody 18-year occupation and many thousands of lives lost.
     
            Also, one key restraint from previous moments of conflict appears increasingly impotent this time around.
     
            The United States, Israel’s largest and strongest ally, seems powerless to temper Israel’s military moves, while supporting its right to self-defense. Israel’s ground operation started just hours after US President Joe Biden called for a ceasefire.
     
            The US administration’s diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza have at times been publicly undermined by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, the proposal for a temporary Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, which Biden officials believed had a positive response from Israel just last week, is now a distant memory.
     
            Lebanese civilians could be forgiven for doubting Israel’s claims of a limited operation. Only time will show if their distrust if justified.
     
            With the world’s eyes now on the crisis unfolding in Lebanon, a humanitarian worker urged people not to look away from Gaza.
     
            Winter is approaching, and the more than 2 million people displaced across Gaza do not have enough food or shelter, Scott Anderson, UNRWA’s deputy humanitarian coordinator said.
     
            “We’re very concerned about the second winter,” Anderson, he told CNN’s Becky Anderson.
     
        “I think people’s resilience will be lower because of the conditions they’ve been living in for the past year. We’re very concerned there could be a spread of disease,” he said, adding polio, hepatitis A and other diseases have already been confirmed in Gaza.
     
 
            The United Nations and other members of the international humanitarian community must be enabled to bring in sufficient aid through the Rafah crossing, which is the point where aid travels from Egypt into Gaza, Anderson said.
     
            Despite immense need, aid has only trickled into Gaza throughout the war due to limited entry points, long checks by Israeli authorities and in some cases protests.
     
            Even once aid enters Gaza, it is difficult for it to reach the people who need it due to Israeli bombardment, damaged roads, mass displacement and communications blackouts.
     
            Mass amounts of food, tents, and vaccines are currently waiting to enter Gaza, Anderson said.
     
            “It’s a very dire in situation,” Anderson said.
     
            Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah have been engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation since the war in Gaza began following Hamas’ attack on Israel last October.
     
            Hezbollah has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave, much of which has been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombs and fighting.
     
            In recent weeks, Israel has refocused its military objectives north with a new war aim to return displaced residents to their homes along the Lebanon border. About 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah’s rocket attacks.
     
            What’s unfolded is some of the fiercest fighting between the two longtime foes since the 2006 Lebanon war, which killed 1,100 people in the country.
     
            Last month, pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon in a coordinated Israeli attack that killed dozens of people and maimed thousands, including women and children.
     
            Israel has also stepped up a relentless bombing campaign across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure and leadership, but the strikes have also decimated homes and neighborhoods in densely populated areas. Massive airstrikes in southern Beirut have killed a string of Hezbollah leaders, as well as more than 1,000 people.
     
            An Israeli military attack has killed a Palestinian militant at a refugee camp in southern Lebanon, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported.
     
            The overnight strike on the Ain Al-Helweh refugee camp targeted the house of Munir Muqdah, commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades in Lebanon and father of the killed militant, the report said Tuesday.
     
            The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, the military wing of Palestinian political party Fatah, announced the death of Hassan Munir Muqdah in what it described as an “assassination operation.”
     
            The fate of the Palestinian commander is unknown.
     
            Israel’s military on Tuesday warned residents of southern Lebanon not to travel south following a cross-border incursion by Israeli troops targeting Hezbollah.
     
            The Israeli military’s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said that Hezbollah militants were “using the civilian environment and residents as human shields to launch attacks” amid intense fighting in the region.
     
        “For your personal safety, we urge you not to travel by vehicle from the northern area to the area south of the Litani River,” Adraee said, adding the warning is in “effect until further notice.”
     
 
But many residents are unable to leave: Prior to the Israeli ground incursion, a woman living in one of Lebanon’s southernmost villages told CNN that she and her family were stuck in their homes amid intensive Israeli bombardment.
     
        “We’re terrified. We’re having an emotional breakdown,” said the woman, who asked for her name not to be disclosed.
     
 
            Witnesses also said artillery fire and airstrikes were raining down on the villages Monday.
     
            Israel has launched a ground incursion into Lebanon targeting the militant group Hezbollah, opening a new and dangerous phase in almost a year of war.
     
            The incursion, which Israel’s security cabinet has called the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, is the fourth time that Israeli soldiers have publicly entered Lebanese soil in nearly 50 years, and the first since Israel’s 34-day war in the country in 2006.
     
Extent of incursion unclear: Israeli officials have characterized the incursion into southern Lebanon as limited in scope, saying there will be “no long-term occupation.”
     
            But officials have declined to say how deep Israeli troops would venture into the country or how long the operation is expected to last.
     
            Previous military operations initially declared by Israel to be limited in their goals have proved to be anything but. Examples include Israel’s years-long occupation of southern Lebanon that began in 1982 with the stated aim of a brief and limited mission to destroy the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
     
            More recently, Israel’s military declared a “limited” operation in Rafah, southern Gaza that has left the city in ruins.
     
How has the US reacted? Attention has focused on how the once-mighty US is increasingly powerless to rein in its ally or to influence other major belligerents in a fast-worsening regional crisis.
     
            The US is a key provider of Israel’s weapons — it likely supplied the 2,000-pound bombs used to kill Hezbollah’s leader — but Biden and his advisers have continued to call for a diplomatic resolution.
     
Read the full story.
 
            Israel is ramping up strikes on Iran-backed proxies on multiple fronts, with “a limited ground operation” across its northern border into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, and long-distance attacks on Houthi militants inside of Yemen, as fears of a devastating regional conflict loom large.
     
            Along with Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah and the Houthi movement are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” an alliance of Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen.
     
            Hezbollah and the Houthis have launched regular attacks on Israel over the past year and have vowed to keep fighting until the war in Gaza ends.
     
            Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took public aim at Iran, as their long-standing shadow war is pushed further into the open.
     
            In a televised speech, he told the Iranian people that “Israel stands with you,” directly addressing them “without filters, without middlemen,” and repeated his appeal to Iranians to reject their government.
     
        Netanyahu also repeated his warning that “there is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.”
     
 
            A senior US official previously told CNN the US believes Iran will intervene in the conflict if they judge that they are about to “lose” Hezbollah. The combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah had already taken hundreds of fighters off the battlefield, according to that official and another person familiar with the intelligence.
     
            In the same attack that assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, a senior member of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp, was also killed.
     
            In response, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that Israel faces “crushing blows” to come.
     
            Hamas militants were the target of a deadly Israeli attack on a school in northern Gaza overnight, Israel’s military said.
     
            At least seven people were killed and a number of others wounded in the strike on the Al-Shujaiya School in the east of Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced civilians, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense in the enclave.
     
             The Israeli military said Tuesday that a Hamas command and control center “was embedded inside a compound that previously served as the ‘Shejaiya’ UNRWA School.”
     
        “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,” it said.
     
 
            CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military’s claim about Hamas operating in the school.
     
            CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger has called Israel’s continued offensive in Lebanon in the face of US resistance a “remarkable example of defiance of an ally.”
     
            When asked by CNN’s Laura Coates why there appears to be so much daylight between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden, who again on Monday called for a ceasefire in Lebanon, Sanger said one of the reasons is “these two leaders don’t have a whole lot left to say to each other.”
     
            Biden and Netanyahu have not spoken since Israeli wiped out Hezbollah’s longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, Sanger said, a move Israel knew the US would not object to.
     
        “The PM has calculated rightly that he could ignore the call for a ceasefire,” which at one point last week the Biden administration said Israel had agreed to, said Sanger, who is also the White House and National Security Correspondent for The New York Times.
     
 
            Biden has declined to use his only form of leverage against Israel, Sanger added, which would be to withhold weapons.
     
            Experts have told CNN Israel likely used US-supplied 2,000 bombs in the strike that took out Nasrallah.
     
        Biden “doesn’t want to do that and appear to be keeping Israel from defending itself,” Sanger said.
     
 
            Israel launched numerous attacks on southern Lebanon overnight, causing “severe damage,” the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) reported on Tuesday morning.
     
            Israel hit various sites in Lebanon’s South Governorate with airstrikes, artillery shelling and heavy machine gun fire, destroying shops and damaging private property and crops, NNA reported.
     
            Israeli airstrikes also hit multiple locations in the neighboring Nabatiyeh Governorate, followed by “continuous artillery shelling” throughout the night, according to NNA.
     
            Both the South and Nabatiyeh governorates are on the other side of Israel’s northern border with Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted Metula, in northern Israel, twice this morning hours following the Israeli military’s incursion into Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah said a gathering of soldiers in Metula was targeted with artillery and rocket fire, and that they had successfully hit their target.
     
            The attack was “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people” in Gaza, and “in defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group said.
     
            The Israeli military said that “approximately five projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and fallen projectiles were identified in the area,” without indicating where they had come down.
     
            The Israeli military said it had intercepted “two projectiles” that crossed from Lebanon in a separate incident. It said that sirens were also sounded in the area of Bar’am, in northern Israel, and “one projectile was identified crossing from Lebanon and fell in an open area.”
     
            The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced a $100 million aid package for Lebanon as it expressed deep concern over the “dangerous situation” in the country and its impact on regional stability, state-run Emirates News Agency reported.
     
        The UAE’s foreign ministry also reiterated its “unwavering position toward Lebanon’s unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity,” and emphasized “steadfast support for the people of Lebanon during this challenging period,” according to a statement cited by the report.
     
 
            The aid from the UAE comes as the United Nations’ agency for humanitarian emergencies (OCHA) warns of the devastating impact on civilians of the recent escalations in Lebanon.
     
        OCHA has urged the international community to “urgently promote de-escalation and ensure that all parties respect international humanitarian law, while prioritizing immediate humanitarian assistance to the affected people.”
     
 
            The Lebanon country director for aid agency Relief International told CNN on Sunday that the aid sector’s capacity is already limited following the displacement of about 1 million people in the country by Israeli attacks.
     
            The World Food Programme has also launched an emergency project to scale up food assistance for up to 1 million people in need in Lebanon.
     
            The Israeli military says soldiers including paratroopers and commandos, as well as armored corps troops have been “preparing for limited, localized, targeted operations in southern Lebanon that began last night.”
     
            Soldiers have been training in northern Israel over the past few weeks, the military says, after plans were approved.
     
            The military said that the soldiers had gained skills and operational experience in Gaza over many months.
     
        “They moved north and are now operating in the northern arena after making the necessary adjustments for fighting in Lebanon,” it said.
     
 
            The Israeli military earlier said it had begun “a limited ground operation” in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. There will be “no long-term occupation” of Lebanon, Israeli officials said, but declined to provide a timeline.
     
            Israel has launched a ground operation southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. Israeli officials said there would be “no long-term occupation” of Lebanon but declined to provide a timeline.
     
            The ground offensive comes after hours of Israeli raids and artillery fire across the border.
     
Here’s what you need to know:﻿
 
            • Mass casualties: At least 95 people were killed in Israeli strikes yesterday, adding to a death toll of more than 1,000 since last Monday. One million people in Lebanon have been displaced by the fighting, the prime minister said.
     
            • Lebanese army retreats: The Lebanese army evacuated observation posts at the southern border with Israel and moved to barracks in preparation for the ground offensive, a security source told CNN.
     
Israel defies US: The White House reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself but warned of the risk of “mission creep,” one day after President Joe Biden once again called for a ceasefire. Israel’s escalation in its war with Hezbollah defies rising pressure from the US, a key provider of its weapons. US-supplied 2,000-pound bombs were likely used in the Israeli attack that killed Hezbollah’s leader on Friday.
     
            • UN opposes ground incursion: “We all know the devastation that an all-out war, a ground war in Lebanon would bring to the people of Israel and the people of Lebanon,” the UN chief’s spokesperson said Monday.
     
            • Strikes on Damascus: An Israeli strike has killed a well-know television anchor and two others, state news agency SANA reported. Israel has launched airstrikes in Syria intermittently since October 7.
     
            • US troops: An unspecified number of US troops have been put on prepare to deploy orders to the Middle East, the Pentagon said Monday.
     
            • International evacuations: Multiple governments including the UK and Germany have organized for their citizens to evacuate Lebanon.
     
            • Israel’s wide battles: Israel has struck a refugee camp and school housing displaced Palestinians overnight in Gaza, where it is pressing on with its war against Hamas. Further afield, a CNN reporter joined the Israeli military on its longest-range combat mission since 1985 to strike a Houthi-controlled port in Yemen.
 
            This week’s ground incursion into southern Lebanon is the latest chapter in a long history of Israel sending its troops into the territory of its northern neighbor.
     
Here is a timeline of Israel’s previous invasions of Lebanon, one of which lasted years:
 
1978: Israel first sent troops across the border after members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) entered Israel from Lebanon by sea and seized control of a civilian bus, killing dozens of Israelis, according to the IDF.
     
            In response, Israel occupied most of the southern part of the country, despite Lebanon’s claims it had nothing to do with the bus attack. This eventually led to the creation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, (UNIFIL) tasked with securing Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon.
     
19﻿82: The longest Israeli invasion of Lebanon began in June 1982. Much like this week’s declarations, Israel said the incursion was going to be brief and limited with a mission to destroy the PLO.
     
            But it resulted in a years-long occupation of southern Lebanon and Israeli troops bogged down in a protracted and increasingly unpopular war.
     
            Israeli forces ended up initially taking almost half of Lebanon’s territory including West Beirut. The operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reports, and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila.
     
            That investigation held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by Israel-allied right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Israeli troops withdrew from West Beirut after that but continued to occupy southern Lebanon until 2000. That conflict also ultimately birthed Hezbollah.
     
2006: In 2006, Hezbollah militants infiltrated Israel in a surprise attack, killing eight Israeli soldiers and kidnapping two more in an attempt to prompt a prisoner exchange.
     
            Israel retaliated with a massive air operation followed by a sweeping ground offensive, which ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire.
     
            The month-long war killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, hundreds of them children, according to Human Rights Watch. Forty-nine Israeli civilians and 121 IDF soldiers were killed, according to the Israeliu military.
 
            A UN commission found the IDF used “excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate” force against civilians.
     
            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Monday with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, “to review security developments and Israeli operations,” according to a Pentagon readout of the call.
     
            Austin and Gallant “agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hizballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel’s northern communities,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, wrote in the statement.
     
            The Israeli military said it has begun “a limited ground operation” in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah.
     
            Earlier Monday, President Joe Biden told reporters that “we should have a ceasefire now,” when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces’ raids into southern Lebanon. “I’m comfortable with them stopping,” the president said.
     
        “The Secretary made clear that the United States is well postured to defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations, and determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict. The Secretary and Minister Gallant discussed the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel,” the statement read.
     
 
            Israeli strikes killed at least 13 people and wounded a number of others in central Gaza late Monday night, health officials told CNN.
     
            The casualties were caused by at least two Israeli attacks on the Nuseirat refugee camp, according to officials at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the enclave.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            The reports come after Gaza’s Civil Defense said an Israeli strike killed at least seven people and wounded a number of others at a school housing displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza on Tuesday.
     
            The Biden White House reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself as it begins its incursion in southern Lebanon, but warned of the potential of mission creep.
     
            The White House said it sees Israel’s incursion as being in line with the country’s right to defend itself against threats from terror groups.
     
            But the spokesperson went on to warn:
     
        “Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis.”
     
 
            Mission creep is a term used to describe the “gradual broadening of the original objectives of a mission or organization,” according to Merriam-Webster’s definition.
     
Some context: US officials have told CNN that they have been informed by their Israeli counterparts that Israel’s ground operation was expected to be limited in scope and duration. But they have publicly emphasized the possibility that what the Israelis are currently referring to as a limited ground operation could ultimately broaden in scope and turn into a longer-term incursion.
     
            President Joe Biden last week unveiled a 21-day ceasefire proposal, backed by other US allies, that was almost immediately rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden and his advisers continue to call for a diplomatic resolution.
     
            An Israeli strike killed at least seven people and wounded a number of others at a school housing displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza, the Civil Defense in the enclave said Tuesday morning.
     
            CNN cannot independently verify the report of the strike at the Al-Shujaiya School in the east of Gaza City, and has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            Israeli attacks have killed at least 41,615 people and wounded 96,359 in Gaza since October 7, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave said Monday.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been considering a plan to force all Palestinian civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to lay siege to Hamas and force the release of hostages.
     
            It is unclear how many Palestinians remain north of the Netzarim Corridor, which splits Gaza in two, but estimates run into the hundreds of thousands.
     
            Israel’s expected ground incursion into Lebanon will drive home a new strategic reality of a year of war — the once-mighty US is powerless to rein in its ally or to influence other major belligerents in a fast-worsening regional crisis.
     
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Monday launched the next stage of its onslaught against Hezbollah with what the Israel Defense Forces called a “limited ground operation” into Lebanon — despite weeks of requests from Washington for restraint and familiar (and spurned) calls for de-escalation.
     
This came just hours after President Joe Biden said “we should have a ceasefire now,” when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces’ previous raids into southern Lebanon. “I’m comfortable with them stopping,” the president said.
     
            His comments only underscored the chasm between the US and Israeli governments on a day when Netanyahu told Iranians in a broadcast, “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.”
     
            The disconnect is widening as it coincides with the endgame of a cliffhanger US election. Biden’s room for maneuver is limited if he is to avoid exacerbating the domestic political impact of war in the Middle East — a factor Netanyahu, a consummate operator in US politics, surely understands. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, has largely stuck to the administration line — despite earlier comments that suggested she might take a slightly harder rhetorical stance toward Netanyahu while emphasizing the plight of Palestinian civilians.

            Safaa Ahmed, a well-known Syrian television anchor, has been killed alongside two others in an overnight Israeli strike on Damascus, Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
     
        “The General Authority for Radio and Television announces the death of the anchor Safaa Ahmed as a martyr following the treacherous Israeli aggression on the capital, Damascus,” the report said.
     
 
            The Syrian defense ministry said the Israeli military targeted Damascus with drones and planes at around 2 a.m. local time from the “direction of the occupied Golan Heights.”
     
            “Our air defense systems confronted the aggression’s missiles and drones and shot down most of them,” the ministry said, adding that three civilians and nine others were injured as a result of the strike.
     
            Videos posted to social media, and geolocated by CNN, show that an explosion took place next to Syria’s Telecom building, west of the city’s military airport. Additional videos geolocated by CNN show a car in flames after the blast.
     
            It is not clear if this is the location where Ahmed or the others were killed, and the location of their death was not reported by SANA.
     
            When asked about the reports, the Israeli military said: “We do not comment on reports in the foreign media.”
     
Some background: Israel has launched airstrikes in Syria intermittently since Hamas’ October 7 attacks last year but does not usually confirm when it has carried out attacks there.
     
            Israeli officials are characterizing the ground operation into southern Lebanon as limited in scope, saying there will be “no long-term occupation” but declining to specify the duration.
     
            Israeli troops will be focused on removing “immediate threats” from Lebanese villages along the border, including Hezbollah’s ability to infiltrate northern Israel, Israeli officials insisted.
     
            A senior Israeli official also said Israel does not plan to remain in Lebanon, said there will be “no long-term occupation of southern Lebanon.”
     
            But the officials declined to say how deep Israeli troops would venture into the country or how long the operation is expected to last.
     
            As Israel’s ground operation in Lebanon began, the sounds of outgoing artillery fire, drones and helicopters rang through the air from a CNN team’s position close to the border.
     
            Several explosions, plumes of smoke and flashes of light were also seen coming from the direction of the Lebanese village of Aadaysit Marjaayoun.
     
            A Hebrew statement by the Israeli military says it has begun a “limited ground operation” in southern Lebanon.
     
        “The IDF began a few hours ago a targeted and limited ground operation in the area of southern Lebanon against terrorist targets and infrastructures of the terrorist organization Hezbollah, in a number of villages near the border, which pose an immediate and real threat to Israeli settlements on the northern border,” it said in the statement early Tuesday local time.
     
 
            This appears to culminate a day of positioning for an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon.
     
            Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed at least seven high-ranking Hezbollah commanders and officials in recent weeks, including the militant group’s chief Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in a strike on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday.
     
            Here’s a look at some of the group’s leaders who have been killed.
     
            Twenty-four wounded and sick children and their companions have been evacuated from Gaza in a joint Israeli-European Union operation, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            In total, 32 people were evacuated from the enclave.
     
            The Palestinians who were evacuated are being relocated to Romania, according to the Israeli official. The action was directly approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
     
Some context: One of these children evacuated to Romania was registered with Children Not Numbers, a non-governmental organization, whose founder, Somaya Ouazzani, says evacuating children out of Gaza for medical treatments has become increasingly hard since early May when the Rafah border with Egypt shut down.
     
            “Evacuations are near impossible. They take multi-agency efforts,” she said. “The evacuations do not represent the sickest kids in Gaza.”
     
            Several experts and NGOs also reported similar experiences to CNN, noting that many children with critical cases die while waiting to be evacuated.
     
        Prior to the shutdown, the evacuation process “was still very bureaucratic,” but all NGOs “understood the process and knew the hurdles that were in place,” said Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency medicine physician who has been to Gaza several times. “Now it’s arbitrary.”
     
 
            Before the Rafah border shut down, the Palestinian Children Relief Fund (PCRF) was seeing “50 or so kids a day approved for evacuation,” according to Tareq Hailat, head of the Treatment Abroad program at PCRF. “Now, we are lucky if we see one.”
     
            Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system is one of the most important tools in its arsenal and has saved countless civilian lives over various conflicts in the last decade, analysts say. It is highly effective. The Israel Defense Forces said the system boasted a 95.6% success rate during a rocket salvo fired by Islamic Jihad in May 2023.
     
            Development on the Iron Dome first began in 2007. After tests in 2008 and 2009, the first Iron Dome batteries were deployed in 2011. The system has been upgraded several times since.

• The Israeli military says it has begun “a limited ground operation” in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. There will be “no long-term occupation” of Lebanon, Israeli officials said, but declined to provide a timeline.
     
            • The ground offensive comes after hours of Israeli raids and artillery fire across the border, and after Israel restricted civilian movements in some border communities. Ahead of the incursion, Israel’s security cabinet approved the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, according to a national broadcaster.
     
            • Israel’s blistering escalation in its war with Hezbollah defies pressure from the US, a key ally, to reach a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. The escalation in the war has killed more than 1,000 people, destroyed homes and displaced 1 million in Lebanon, authorities say.
     
            • Hezbollah said it would choose a leader as soon as possible after Israel assassinated its chief Hassan Nasrallah. The group also vowed to continue fighting Israel in support of Palestinians, even after a growing number of senior figures were killed.
     
Our live coverage of Israel’s incursion into southern Lebanon has moved here.
 
            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Monday with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, “to review security developments and Israeli operations,” according to a Pentagon readout of the call.
     
            Austin and Gallant “agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hizballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel’s northern communities,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, wrote in the statement.
     
            The Israeli military said it has begun “a limited ground operation” in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah.
     
            Earlier Monday, President Joe Biden told reporters that “we should have a ceasefire now,” when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces’ raids into southern Lebanon. “I’m comfortable with them stopping,” the president said.
     
        “The Secretary made clear that the United States is well postured to defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations, and determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict. The Secretary and Minister Gallant discussed the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel,” the statement read.
     
 
            Israeli strikes killed at least 13 people and wounded a number of others in central Gaza late Monday night, health officials told CNN.
     
            The casualties were caused by at least two Israeli attacks on the Nuseirat refugee camp, according to officials at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the enclave.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            The reports come after Gaza’s Civil Defense said an Israeli strike killed at least seven people and wounded a number of others at a school housing displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza on Tuesday.
     
            The Biden White House says that it sees Israel’s ground operation in southern Lebanon as being in line with the country’s right to defend itself against threats from terror groups.
     
        “We understand the Israelis will be conducting limited operations to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure that could be used to threaten Israeli citizens. This is in line with Israel’s right to defend its citizens and safely return civilians to their homes,” a National Security Council spokesperson said late Monday. 
     
 
        “We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups.”
     
        a National Security Council spokesperson said.
     
            But the spokesperson went on to warn: “Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis.”
     
Some context: US officials have told CNN that they have been informed by their Israeli counterparts that Israel’s ground operation was expected to be limited in scope and duration. But they have publicly emphasized the possibility that what the Israelis are currently referring to as a limited ground operation could ultimately broaden in scope and turn into a longer-term incursion.
     
            President Joe Biden last week unveiled a 21-day ceasefire proposal, backed by other US allies, that was almost immediately rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden and his advisers continue to call for a diplomatic resolution.
     
            An Israeli strike killed at least seven people and wounded a number of others at a school housing displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza, the Civil Defense in the enclave said Tuesday morning.
     
            CNN cannot independently verify the report of the strike at the Al-Shujaiya School in the east of Gaza City, and has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            Israeli attacks have killed at least 41,615 people and wounded 96,359 in Gaza since October 7, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave said Monday.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been considering a plan to force all Palestinian civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to lay siege to Hamas and force the release of hostages.
     
            It is unclear how many Palestinians remain north of the Netzarim Corridor, which splits Gaza in two, but estimates run into the hundreds of thousands.
     
            An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been intercepted “over the Mediterranean Sea dozens of kilometers off the coast of central Israel” overnight, the Israeli military said.
     
            The Israeli military did not provide an exact location for the interception or give any details about the direction from which the UAV had crossed into Israel.
     
            Safaa Ahmed, a well-known Syrian television anchor, has been killed alongside two others in an overnight Israeli strike on Damascus, Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
     
        “The General Authority for Radio and Television announces the death of the anchor Safaa Ahmed as a martyr following the treacherous Israeli aggression on the capital, Damascus,” the report said.
     
 
            The Syrian defense ministry said the Israeli military targeted Damascus with drones and planes at around 2 a.m. local time from the “direction of the occupied Golan Heights.”
     
            “Our air defense systems confronted the aggression’s missiles and drones and shot down most of them,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that three civilians and nine others were injured as a result of the strike.
     
            Videos posted to social media, and geolocated by CNN, show that an explosion took place next to Syria’s Telecom building, west of the city’s military airport. Additional videos geolocated by CNN show a car in flames after the blast.
     
            It is not clear if this is the location where Ahmed or the others were killed, and the location of their death was not reported by SANA.
     
            When asked about the reports, the Israeli military said: “We do not comment on reports in the foreign media.”
     
            Israel has launched airstrikes in Syria intermittently since Hamas’ October 7 attacks last year but does not usually confirm when it has carried out attacks there.
     
            Israeli officials are characterizing the ground operation into southern Lebanon as limited in scope, saying there will be “no long-term occupation” but declining to specify the duration.
     
            Israeli troops will be focused on removing “immediate threats” from Lebanese villages along the border, including Hezbollah’s ability to infiltrate northern Israel, Israeli officials insisted.
     
            A senior Israeli official also said Israel does not plan to remain in Lebanon, said there will be “no long-term occupation of southern Lebanon.”
     
            But the officials declined to say how deep Israeli troops would venture into the country or how long the operation is expected to last.
     
            As Israel’s ground operation in Lebanon began, the sounds of outgoing artillery fire, drones and helicopters rang through the air from a CNN team’s position close to the border.
     
            Several explosions, plumes of smoke and flashes of light were also seen coming from the direction of the Lebanese village of Aadaysit Marjaayoun.
     
            A Hebrew statement by the Israeli military says it has begun a “limited ground operation” in southern Lebanon.
     
        “The IDF began a few hours ago a targeted and limited ground operation in the area of southern Lebanon against terrorist targets and infrastructures of the terrorist organization Hezbollah, in a number of villages near the border, which pose an immediate and real threat to Israeli settlements on the northern border,” it said in the statement early Tuesday local time.
     
 
            This appears to culminate a day of positioning for an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s expected ground incursion into Lebanon will drive home a new strategic reality of a year of war — the once-mighty US is powerless to rein in its ally or to influence other major belligerents in a fast-worsening regional crisis.
     
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Monday launched the next stage of its onslaught against Hezbollah with what the Israel Defense Forces called a “limited ground operation” into Lebanon — despite weeks of requests from Washington for restraint and familiar (and spurned) calls for de-escalation.
     
This came just hours after President Joe Biden said “we should have a ceasefire now,” when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces’ previous raids into southern Lebanon. “I’m comfortable with them stopping,” the president said.
     
            His comments only underscored the chasm between the US and Israeli governments on a day when Netanyahu told Iranians in a broadcast, “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.”
     
            The disconnect is widening as it coincides with the endgame of a cliffhanger US election. Biden’s room for maneuver is limited if he is to avoid exacerbating the domestic political impact of war in the Middle East — a factor Netanyahu, a consummate operator in US politics, surely understands. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, has largely stuck to the administration line — despite earlier comments that suggested she might take a slightly harder rhetorical stance toward Netanyahu while emphasizing the plight of Palestinian civilians.

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says its troops have begun “limited, localized and targeted raids” against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.
     
        “In accordance with the decision of the political echelon, a few hours ago, the IDF began limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon,” the IDF wrote in a statement.
     
 
            “These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel,” the statement read.
     
            The United Kingdom is chartering a flight for Britons in Lebanon who want to leave the country, the British government announced on Monday.
     
            The UK’s Foreign Office shared a link on the social media platform X for Britons to register their presence in Lebanon and urged them to await further guidance.
     
            No date for the flight was provided.
     
            The announcement comes as Israel continues to fire artillery into Lebanon ahead of a potential ground incursion.
     
            Israel’s National Security Cabinet has approved the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, ahead of a widely expected ground invasion of Lebanon, according to Israeli national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate.
     
            The Israeli Air Force is also once again bombing the southern suburbs of Beirut.
     
            The Israeli government has informed the United States about “a number of operations,” including ground operations, in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday.
     
            Israel’s defense minister, speaking on Monday with troops near the country’s border with Lebanon, gave one of the clearest signs yet that his country intends to launch some form of ground incursion into Lebanon.
     
        “The elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not the final one,” Yoav Gallant said. “We will employ all the capabilities at our disposal, and if someone on the other side did not understand what those capabilities entail, we mean all capabilities, and you are part of this effort.”
     
 
            Multiple explosions were heard by CNN teams in Beirut Tuesday night as Lebanon braces for an expected Israeli ground invasion.
     
            Thick plumes of smoke were visible in the skies above Beirut’s southern suburbs, CNN video shows.
     
            At least 95 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon over the past 24 hours, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            Another 172 have been injured, the ministry said.
     
Some background: Airstrikes hit inside Beirut’s city limits early Monday, the first time strikes have landed within the city limits of the Lebanese capital since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7.
     
            Until now, Israel’s airstrikes on Beirut have focused on the southern part of the city, the densely populated and predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah have a stronghold.
     
            Israel has issued a warning urging residents living near several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate.
     
            Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson, highlighted several buildings that he said would be targeted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for containing “interests and facilities” belonging to Hezbollah. CNN cannot confirm Adraee’s claims.
     
            The buildings are in the Beirut suburbs of Lilaki, Haret Hreik and Bourj al-Barajneh.
     
            Adraee urged residents who live nearby to move at least 500 meters away from the targeted buildings.
     
        “We will target these facilities very soon. For your safety and the safety of your loved ones — evacuate the buildings immediately and move away from them and the neighboring buildings,” Adraee said.
     
 
            Several communities in northern Israel are now under special instructions limiting the movement of civilians, the regional council of Upper Galilee reported on Monday.
     
            The council — which governs communities in the northernmost Upper Galilee territory — advised residents to avoid gatherings and remain close to protected areas.
     
            The new guidelines are in effect for the communities of Shenir, Dan, Dafna, HaGashrim, Ma’ayan Baruch and Kfar Giladi.
     
            Residents in the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona have also been asked to remain in protected areas until notified otherwise, a spokesperson for the city said in a statement.
     
            Less than 2 miles from the Lebanese border, signs of Israel’s expected ground offensive into southern Lebanon are all around.
     
            Israeli artillery units are firing into southern Lebanon every few minutes, sending one percussive boom after another reverberating through the valley near the Lebanese border.
     
            Soldiers have blocked off an area in northeastern Israel closest to the Lebanese border, declaring it a “closed military zone.”
     
            Near the highway leading to that closed military zone, roughly 100 tanks and other military vehicles are parked in a field — having just arrived in recent days.
     
            Israeli officials have yet to say whether a ground offensive is imminent, but CNN previously reported that Israeli special forces have already begun carrying out raids in Lebanon against Hezbollah positions along the border. US officials say Israel could imminently launch what they described as a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon.
     
            A resident in one of Lebanon’s southernmost villages told CNN that she and her family are stranded in their homes after being surrounded by intensive Israeli bombardment amid fears of an imminent ground incursion.
     
            “We’re terrified. We’re having an emotional breakdown,” she said, asking for her name to not be disclosed. Witnesses said artillery fire and airstrikes were raining down on the villages.
     
            The witness said her family requested the Lebanese army help them evacuate their homes as soldiers fled positions at the border. She said the army declined. CNN reached out to the army for comment.
     
            Earlier, a US official said the United States believes Israel could imminently launch a more limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon than was originally planned following discussions between the two countries this past weekend.
     
            An American drone was shot down over Yemen late Sunday by the Houthis, according to two United States defense officials.
     
            The Iran-backed rebel group claimed the successful downing of the drone.
     
            “The air defenses of the Yemeni Armed Forces shot down an American MQ-9 aircraft while it was carrying out hostile missions in the airspace of Saada Governorate,” Houthi military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yehya Saree said.
     
            The downing of the US drone came after Israel carried out strikes on the Yemeni port cities of Ras Issa and Hodeidah in response to long-range missiles fired at Israel.
     
            Two weeks ago, the Houthis claimed to have shot down another MQ-9 Reaper with a surface-to-air missile over Dhamar Governorate south of the capital of Sana’a. US defense officials acknowledged a drone had been downed, but the cause remains under investigation.
     
            Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, the Houthis claim to have shot down more than 10 US drones, a number rejected by the Pentagon.
     
            “I can tell you that that number is not accurate,” Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a news briefing after the last drone was downed. “It’s too high.”
     
            This wouldn’t be the first time the Houthis have successfully shot down an MQ-9 Reaper. In November and again in February, US officials acknowledged that the Houthis were able to down the drones. Each MQ-9 costs approximately $28 million, according to the Congressional Research Service.
     
            This comes as fears of a broader regional war in the Middle East have spiked in recent weeks as Israel intensifies its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon — another Iran-backed group that provides weapons and training to the Houthis, the Congressional Research Service said.
     
            Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed at least seven high-ranking Hezbollah commanders and officials in recent weeks, including the militant group’s chief Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in a strike on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday.
     
            Here’s a look at some of the group’s leaders who have been killed.
     
Read more about the Hezbollah leaders who remain.
 
            Israel should seize its chance to launch a ground offensive in Lebanon while Hezbollah remains weakened by airstrikes, a former senior Israeli military official tells CNN.
     
        “This is the moment,” retired Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi told CNN, noting that Hezbollah has been significantly weakened by Israeli strikes in recent weeks.
     
 
            Avivi says he believes it is necessary to destroy Hezbollah tunnels, fortified positions and weapons depots near the border – and to push Hezbollah forces back outside the range from which anti-tank missiles could strike communities in northern Israel.
     
        “We cannot create terms for Israelis to return to their homes without pushing Hezbollah out of South Lebanon, certainly at minimum eight miles, which would be anti-tank missile range,” Avivi said.
     
 
            Israel has killed most of Hezbollah’s senior commanders, including its top leader Hassan Nasrallah. This has severely damaged Hezbollah’s operational capabilities, Israeli officials believe, and they also assess that the paramilitary force is in disarray.
     
Correction: An earlier version of this post misspelled retired Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi’s last name.
 
            The Lebanese army has evacuated observation posts at Lebanon’s southern border with Israel and moved to barracks in the border villages, a Lebanese security source tells CNN.
     
Some background: Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant earlier told the heads of regional councils in northern Israel that the “next stage” of Israel’s war against Hezbollah will “begin soon.”
     
            It comes after the Israeli military declared a closed military zone around three towns in the far north on its border with Lebanon. Expectations are high of an imminent ground offensive in Lebanon, and presumably, this will be a staging area for the Israeli military.
     
            The head of the United Nations is opposed to an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon, his spokesperson said Monday.
     
            “We do not want to see any sort of ground invasion,” Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General António Guterres, said during a news conference.
     
            “We all know the devastation that an all-out war, a ground war in Lebanon would bring to the people of Israel and the people of Lebanon,” Dujarric said.
     
            Dujarric said that given the “intensity of the fire” on both sides of the border, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, is unable to carry out patrols and “most of their responsibilities.”
     
            A UNIFIL official told CNN on Monday that the situation at the border “is very tense with serious concerns of escalation and incursions,” and that UNIFIL has not seen incursions as of now.
     
This post has been updated with additional information from UNIFIL.
 
CNN’s Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed reporting to this post.
 
            The Israeli government has informed the United States about “a number of operations,” including ground operations, in Lebanon, the US State Department said Monday.
     
        “They have, at this time, told us that those are limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border, but we’re in continuous conversations with them about it,” spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing.
     
 
            Still, the US is continuing to focus on a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah despite the ongoing military activity, because it ultimately wants “a diplomatic resolution to this conflict,” he added. Miller reiterated that Israel has the “right to defend itself against Hezbollah,” including by “targeting terrorist infrastructure inside Lebanon.”
     
            Miller did not condemn the Israeli government’s ongoing escalations but said that the US has discussed “all the factors” that a so-called escalate to de-escalate campaign entails. He also said the onus is on both the Netanyahu government and Hezbollah to accept the ceasefire proposal.
     
            US officials last week indicated that Israel was prepared to accept. Instead, the Israeli government has very clearly rebuffed a ceasefire and carried out an extensive military campaign in Lebanon over the past several days, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
        “Military pressure can at times enable diplomacy. Of course, military pressure can also lead to miscalculation It can lead to unintended consequences. And we’re in conversations with Israel about all these factors now,” Miller said, refusing to give an assessment as to whether the ongoing military operations by Israel are pushing diplomacy ahead or impeding it.
     
 
            The US is “not evacuating American citizens from Lebanon at this time,” Miller said. The State Department is working with commercial airlines flying out of the country, he added, and encouraged Americans in the country to fill out an intake form so that the department can best assist them.
     
            The Israeli military on Monday evening declared a closed military zone around three towns in the far north on its border with Lebanon.
     
            The “next stage” of Israel’s war against Hezbollah will “begin soon,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the heads of regional councils in northern Israel.
     
            “Following a situational assessment, the areas of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel have been declared a closed military zone,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. “Entry to this area is prohibited.”
     
            This means no civilians are allowed to enter as expectations are high of an imminent ground offensive in Lebanon, and presumably this will be a staging area for the Israeli military.
     
            Those towns make up an area of northernmost Israel that is surrounded on three sides by Lebanon.
     
This post has been updated with more background on closed military zones. 
 
            Israel has been carrying out strikes across Lebanon for days, killing, wounding and displacing many, as it said it was targeting Hezbollah’s leader, commanders and other sites storing weapons.
     
            Here’s a look at the areas it targeted between September 26 and 30.
     
            Israeli fighter jets destroyed a surface-to-air missile launcher positioned by Hezbollah near Beirut’s international airport, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement Monday.
     
            According to the IDF, the launchers have a range of over 50 kilometers (31 miles) and can launch at four targets simultaneously.
     
            The IDF alleged that the missile launchers are “hidden within civilian infrastructure” across Lebanon and “pose a threat to international airspace.” CNN cannot independently verify these claims.
     
            As part of Israel’s military operations, the Israeli Air Force said it struck a range of Hezbollah infrastructure, including headquarters, storage facilities, and missile launchers.
     
            The strikes come as the US believes Israel could imminently launch a more limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon than was originally planned following discussions between the two countries this past weekend, according to a US official. Early Monday morning, sources said Israeli special forces have carried out small raids into Lebanese territory in recent days as part of preparations for a potential Israeli ground offensive.
     
            The Israeli military said Monday that its soldiers have been training near Israel’s northern border to strengthen defense and are “preparing for the next phases of combat.”
     
            Roughly 100 Israeli military vehicles, from tanks to trucks to armored personnel carriers, can be seen in satellite imagery at a makeshift mustering site in a field about five miles from the Lebanon border.
     
            The satellite imagery, provided to CNN by a source, was taken on Sunday. Additional imagery shows that Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles began arriving there after September 26.
     
            CNN is not publishing the satellite imagery to protect the source’s anonymity. The site is made up of two fields previously used for agriculture.
     
            The images show IDF vehicles are still arriving at the site. A large truck, carrying a tank, can be seen on the major highway nearby.
     
            CNN has previously reported that the IDF is beginning preparations for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon.  The IDF would not comment when asked about whether the vehicles were part of a potential invasion force.
     
            Additional videos taken in previous days, posted to social media, as well as others taken by Reuters and CNN, show dozens of vehicles at the site.
     
            Twenty-four wounded and sick children and their companions have been evacuated from Gaza in a joint Israeli-European Union operation, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            In total, 32 people were evacuated from the enclave.
     
            The Palestinians who were evacuated are being relocated to Romania, according to the Israeli official. The action was directly approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
     
Some context: One of these children evacuated to Romania was registered with Children Not Numbers, a non-governmental organization, whose founder, Somaya Ouazzani, says evacuating children out of Gaza for medical treatments has become increasingly hard since early May when the Rafah border with Egypt shut down.
     
            “Evacuations are near impossible. They take multi-agency efforts,” she said. “The evacuations do not represent the sickest kids in Gaza.”
     
            Several experts and NGOs also reported similar experiences to CNN, noting that many children with critical cases die while waiting to be evacuated.
     
            Prior to the shutdown, the evacuation process “was still very bureaucratic,” but all NGOs “understood the process and knew the hurdles that were in place,” said Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency medicine physician who has been to Gaza several times. “Now it’s arbitrary.”
     
            Before the Rafah border shut down, the Palestinian Children Relief Fund (PCRF) was seeing “50 or so kids a day approved for evacuation,” according to Tareq Hailat, head of the Treatment Abroad program at PCRF. “Now, we are lucky if we see one.”
     
            The “next stage” of Israel’s war against Hezbollah will “begin soon,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the heads of regional councils in northern Israel.
     
            In a meeting with the so-called “Confrontation Line” forum on Monday, Gallant discussed the current security situation and said that conflict with Hezbollah was “necessary” for the residents of northern Israel to return home.
     
        “The next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon – it will be a significant factor in changing the security situation and will allow us to complete the important part of the war’s goals: returning the residents to their homes,” he said.
     
 
            Gallant also said he had visited Israeli forces and met with military commanders on the border with Lebanon.
     
            “They are prepared, they are strong, they are in close cooperation,” he said of the troops.
     
            An Israeli official has confirmed to CNN that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding a security consultation with senior security officials, which was expected to begin at 7 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET).
     
            Netanyahu will later meet with the National Security Cabinet at 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), according to the official.
     
            Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he does not think that an Israeli ground operation into Lebanon would be a “solution to the problem.”
     
            Olmert was prime minister when Israel invaded Lebanon in 2006.
     
            He said what is needed in the north of Israel is a joint coordination with the United States, the United Nations and the Lebanese government to move a “weakened” Hezbollah away from the Litani River in southern Lebanon.
     
        “This will not resolve all the issue(s), but it will open up for an opportunity to build up the necessary political powers and the military powers within Lebanon, which may change the balance there,” Olmert said
     
 
            The former prime minister also said Israel should stop its war in Gaza. He told CNN he thinks his country has “reached the objectives that we set out that we could achieve” there.
     
            “There is nothing more that is worth the cost of fighting in the south, particularly the danger to the lives of the hostages, which are still alive and which we may have brought them back in part of an agreement to ceasefire in the south,” he added.
     
            An unspecified number of troops in the US have been put on prepare to deploy orders, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday.
     
        “Secretary Austin increased the readiness of additional US forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies,” she said. “I’m just not going to get into specifics for [operational security] reasons, but these forces cover a wide range of capabilities and missions.”
     
 
            Singh also said that additional air defense support going to the region, announced by the Pentagon on Sunday, are units previously scheduled to deploy that will now be joining units already there instead of replacing them.
     
            The reinforcement of air support capabilities, she said, includes “a certain number of units already deployed to the Middle East region that will be extended, and the forces due to rotate into theater to replace them will now instead augment the in-place forces already in the region.” It will include “an additional few thousand” service members in the region, she said.
     
            “I can tell you these augmented forces include F-16, F-15E, A-10, F-22 fighter aircraft and associated personnel,” Singh said.
     
            US President Joe Biden sharply urged Israel to halt special operations raids in Lebanese territory near Israel’s border Monday.
     
            “I’m more aware than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping,” Biden told a reporter when asked if he was comfortable with the operation.
     
            “We should have a ceasefire now,” he added.
     
            Earlier Monday, one US official described those raids to CNN as “very precise, very targeted, very small raids” – of the kind where “you go in, you go out” to specifically target Hezbollah’s capabilities.
     
            The Biden administration is caught in a high-tension balancing act following the Israeli attack that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah: adjusting its military posture amid fears of escalation, while also aiming to deescalate the conflict five weeks before the US election.
     
            An Israeli airstrike killed at least one Palestinian and wounded several other people at a food market in Bureij, central Gaza, on Monday, according to health officials.
     
            CNN footage from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in Deir al-Balah, showed paramedics wheeling traumatized survivors, swaddled in blankets, on metal stretchers. Many were groaning in pain and covered in a thin layer of dust, with torn clothes and bloodied limbs.
     
            “We were just walking in the middle of the street when a strike hit,” one elderly man, Abdul Nasser Awadallah, told CNN. His grey thobe was covered in flecks of blood. “Some people were torn apart.
     
        “We can’t even express our feelings or what we saw; people were just going about their day in the street.”
     
 
            In one scene, a rescue worker carried a young girl, with bandages wrapped around her upper torso. Her face was expressionless and her pupils dilated in shock. The video shows a nurse asking the child, who was brought to the hospital alone, where her parents are. But she does not respond.
     
            At least 19,000 children in Gaza have been separated from their parents or caregivers, the UN’s children’s agency reported in August.
     
            Another survivor said he was with his young nephew when the blast went off. “Suddenly we heard an explosion,” Mohammad Al Jiedi recalled, while lying on a hospital gurney. His voice was breathless, as he clutched onto his blood-soaked white vest. “I started running. The market was very crowded.”
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike.
     
            American-manufactured 2,000-pound bombs were likely used in the Israeli attack that killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut on Friday night, according to a review of footage showing the operation and its aftermath by CNN and munitions experts.
     
            A video published by the Israeli military on Saturday showed jets it said were used to carry out the attack carrying at least 15 2,000-pound bombs, including the US-made BLU-109, according to Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army who reviewed the footage for CNN.
     
            The bombs, known colloquially as “bunker busters” for their ability to penetrate deep underground before they detonate, were also fitted with the US-made Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) – a precision guidance kit that converts unguided, or “dumb” bombs, into “smart” munitions that can precisely strike a target – according to Ball. On one plane fitted with bombs, pictured taking off in the video, Ball identified at least four as BLU-109s with JDAM kits.
     
            Other types of large bombs may have been used in the operation, Ball added, but only the BLU-190s were visible in the footage. The munitions contain 535 pounds of explosives, significantly less than MK84s, another type of 2,000-pound bomb frequently used by the Israeli military. “BLU-109s give up explosive weight to be able to penetrate targets better than a MK84,” Ball said.

            It was Naim Qassim’s first speech as Hezbollah’s de facto leader.
     
            The group’s deputy secretary general declared the structure of the organization intact despite the near mortal blows dealt by Israel to its military command and control. He vowed to continue to fight Israel and to follow the goals laid out by the late Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. He said that the resolve of Hezbollah’s faithful was the lifeblood of the organization, which would be difficult to defeat.
     
            “We are doing everything in our capacity to repair the assassinations in our rank with substitute rank,” he said. “Israel will not be able to reach our military capabilities.”
     
            Qassim was trying to strike a defiant tone, seeking to defuse the specter of the organization’s rapid degradation. But the optics of the speech belied the messaging. For 18 years, Nasrallah delivered his speeches on a near-monthly basis from a TV studio, complete with a green screen with dates and graphics. Qassim’s address was a tight frame, with what appeared to be a wooden closet as his backdrop. His expressions were pained, and he sweated profusely.
     
            In his final speech two weeks ago, Nasrallah, known by his friends and foes as a master orator, could barely disguise the setbacks that the group endured. He spoke candidly about Israel’s profound infiltration of the group’s ranks, which ultimately led to his killing and that of his top military brass in a huge Israeli airstrike earlier.
     
            Qassim’s speech reinforced the idea of a once vaunted militant organization being driven deeper and deeper underground. Beyond the rhetoric about Hezbollah’s faith and resilience, he was scant on the details of how the group would come back from the setbacks. Nasrallah’s successor had not yet been named, he said.
     
            The 71-year-old Shiite cleric also made no mention of the late Hezbollah leader’s funeral plans, another psychological blow to a group that holds the burial rites of those slain by Israel as sacrosanct.
     
            In his final speech, Nasrallah tried to impress upon his followers that his group may have his lost a battle, but not the war. “In times of battle, one day the enemy takes from us, and the next we take from them,” he said.
     
            Qassim and Hezbollah’s surviving leadership will seek to drive that point home, aiming to buoy hope and willpower even as the group’s muscular posture visibly diminishes.
     
            A German military plane landed in Beirut Monday to evacuate non-essential embassy employees and other German nationals, the country’s foreign office and defense ministry said.
     
            Employees of partner organizations and German citizens with medical conditions will be evacuated on the Airbus A321 alongside certain embassy employees and family members, according to the ministries.
     
            The German foreign office said it raised the emergency level for its diplomatic missions in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Ramallah over the weekend. While those missions remain operational, many employees have been told to return to Germany, according to the foreign ministry.
     
            Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told journalists that a ceasefire with Israel is in Hezbollah’s interest, as he visited Lebanon on Monday.
     
            “Hezbollah carries a heavy response in the current situation for entering into the conflict from October 7,” Barrot said, adding that he had repeated his calls on Israel to refrain from a ground invasion of Lebanon following days of Israeli strikes across the country.
     
            This weekend, France handed over 12 tons of medical aid to the Lebanese medical authorities, the French foreign ministry said, including two mobile medical units that will take care of 1,000 seriously wounded people in Lebanese hospitals.
     
            France also promised 10 million euros ($11.16 million) of emergency humanitarian aid for NGOs in Lebanon.
     
            The Israel Security Agency (ISA) says it has foiled several assassination attempts coordinated by Iran on Israeli territory.
     
        “In recent weeks, the ISA has detected a significant step up in Iran’s efforts to promote assassination attacks against targets in Israel,” an ISA statement says. “Within this framework, very significant countermeasures were carried out by the ISA, some of them in advanced stages of collection and readiness for execution.”
     
 
            The ISA has been investigating Iranian intelligence services actively trying to recruit Israeli citizens online and in person by offering high cash payments in exchange for “’tasks’ of a dangerous nature.”
     
            “The ISA asks the public to increase attention and take extra caution in any case where suspicion arises… and especially when the sums involved are large and are not adequate to the nature of the requested tasks, or alternatively, as the execution of unusual tasks is requested,” the ISA adds.
     
            Aboard an aging Boeing 707, thousands of feet above the Red Sea, I don a set of high-tech 3D goggles and stare at the small TV monitor recessed in a bank of retro dials and switches.
     
            Saudi Arabia’s amber desert slides by to my right, Egypt’s coast to my left, then a monstrous F35 fighter jet fills the tiny screen.
     
            I am with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) – the first foreign journalist to be taken on a combat mission more than a thousand miles from Israel aboard a fighter jet refuel tanker. 
 
            Israel has been engaged in an escalating war since Hamas’ October 7 attack last year – not just in Gaza, but in Lebanon with Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel October 8; in Yemen with the Houthis, who have launched long-range attacks at Israel’s main population centers; even in the Syrian and Iranian capitals.
     
            Israel’s response to those attacks have killed nearly 42,000 in Gaza and more than 1,000 in Lebanon. Deadly bombing campaigns in Yemen have destroyed critical infrastructure in a war-torn country that has for years been one of the worst humanitarian cases in the world.
     
            Israel’s invitation to join this mission came with no detail about the plane’s destination. As I climb the plane’s rickety steps, I have no idea where I am going or what this IDF flight will reveal about military operations.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Iranian people that “Israel stands with you” in a televised speech on Monday, directly addressing them “without filters, without middlemen.”
     
            Netanyahu repeated previous claims that “there is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.”
     
            Throughout his speech, Netanyahu urged the Iranian people to reject their “tyrant” regime that is bringing “the noble Persian people closer to the abyss.”
     
            “If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East,” he said.
     
Keep in mind: Netanyahu has released similar messages to Iran, which backs Hezbollah, Hamas and Yemen’s Houthi rebels, in recent years, regularly appealing to its citizens to reject the regime.
     
            The United States believes that Israel could imminently launch a more limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon than was originally planned following discussions between the two countries this past weekend, a US official says.
     
            The limited ground incursion would target Hezbollah infrastructure near the border with Israel.  Israeli special forces have already carried out small raids into Lebanese territory in recent days as part of preparations for a potential Israeli ground offensive, according to US officials and two sources familiar with the matter.
     
            After operations into Lebanese villages along the border – known as the Blue Line - the Israeli troops are expected to pull back into Israel. The US does not believe that the intent looks like Israel’s 34-day operation in Lebanon in 2006, the US official argued, but rather a significantly slimmed down version of that and what was previously being planned.
     
            The source did caution that US officials are concerned that what could start as a limited incursion may transition into a larger operation over a longer term. Those concerns are being discussed with the Israeli side, the US official said.
     
CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and MJ Lee contributed reporting to this post. 
 
            Budget airline Flydubai has canceled flights from Dubai to Beirut up to October 7, while Emirates has extended flight cancellations on this route until October 8 amid fears of escalation in the region.
     
            In a statement to CNN, Emirates said: “The safety of crew and customers is our top priority and will not be compromised.” Both airlines stated they will “continue to monitor the situation closely.”
     
            Qatar Airways has suspended flights to and from Beirut until further notice, citing “the ongoing situation in Lebanon.”
     
            Last week, the Lufthansa Group extended suspensions of flights to Beirut until October 26.
     
Some background: Airstrikes hit Beirut in the early hours of Monday morning, the first time strikes have landed within the city limits of the Lebanese capital in the current war.
     
            Until now, Israel’s airstrikes on the Beirut have focused on the southern part of the city, the densely populated and predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah have a stronghold.
     
            Broken pieces of gray concrete littered a street in central Beirut on Monday. Locals’ chatter and car horns pierced the air, as residents surveyed the aftermath of an airstrike in the Lebanese capital.
     
            “We were sleeping. Suddenly, we heard the sound of sirens and an explosion,” said Abu Muhammad, a local resident, told CNN’s Ben Wedeman. “People’s homes were destroyed.”
     
            CNN footage showed fallen shop signs near the Cola intersection – where the hollowed-out floor of an apartment block stood in ruins. The attack at 1 a.m. local time marked the first instance where strikes have hit within the city limits of Beirut, since the most recent escalation.
     
            Three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) were killed in the strike early Monday, according to the group. Until now, Israeli strikes have targeted the southern part of the city, in the densely populated and predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah have a strong presence. Locals in central Beirut Monday told CNN they did not know who lived in the block.
     
            Another passerby, Muhammad Darwish, said he went to the scene of the attack after his family – who lives on the other side of the building – called him in terror.
     
            “It was like the Day of Judgment,” he told CNN. “The sound of the explosion when they bombed shook the whole area… I saw body parts.
     
            “We will survive,” added Darwish. “All they (Israel) care about is killing and causing destruction. They want to cause strife in the country.”
     
            US officials have confirmed that Israeli forces conducted special operations raids in Lebanese territory near the Israel-Lebanon border Monday morning.
     
            One official described those raids to CNN as “very precise, very targeted, very small raids” – of the kind where “you go in, you go out” to specifically target Hezbollah’s capabilities.
     
            US officials are currently not describing these Israeli raids as a ground incursion, even as they continue to carefully brace for the possibility of a limited ground operation that could come in the coming days.
     
            Separately, Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as “a brutal terrorist” as he once again called for diplomacy, despite the Israeli government’s continued rejection of US pleas for a diplomatic path forward in either Lebanon or Gaza.
     
            “Lebanon, the region, the world are safer without” Nasrallah, Blinken said in remarks at the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS ministerial.
     
            Blinken again stressed the need for ceasefires on the blue line and in Gaza, saying that “diplomacy remains the best and only path to achieving greater stability in the Middle East.” He said the US is committed to “urgently driving these efforts forward.”
     
            Israeli special forces have carried out small raids into Lebanese territory in recent days as part of preparations for a potential ground offensive, two sources familiar with the matter said.
     
            Israeli commandos infiltrated Lebanese territory, targeting Hezbollah positions near the border to gather intelligence and destroy Hezbollah posts in the area, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters.
     
            The Israeli military declined to comment.
     
            The targeted raids are the latest indication that Israel is laying the groundwork for a significant ground incursion into Lebanon, although the Israeli government does not yet appear to have made a final decision about launching such an offensive.
     
            Israel has stepped up strikes on various targets across Lebanon since Thursday September 19 in a series of attacks that have left hundreds of civilians dead and injured, and displaced at least 1 million people across the country.
     
            Israel’s stated war goal is to “ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday, and its military has also said it is striking Hezbollah targets, particularly across southern Lebanon and Beirut.
     
            Hezbollah is the world’s most heavily armed non-state group. It is backed by Iran and is based on the Lebanon-Israel border. It has been firing missiles at Israel since October 8 2023, when Israel invaded Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attacks a day earlier. Hezbollah said the strikes were in solidarity with Palestinians.
     
            The tit-for-tat exchange of missiles escalated in July when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr in a strike on Beirut. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles at targets in Israel in August.
     
            The latest escalation started after Israel is believed to have exploded thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members across the country in mid-September. Hezbollah retaliated, with a missile intercepted near Tel Aviv – the first to reach deep into Israel.
     
            Since then, Israel has been fiercely attacking Lebanon – killing at least 20 Hezbollah fighters on Friday alone, including the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah and his two close associates.
     
            CNN’s Ben Wedeman is at the scene of the latest Israeli airstrike on a building in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
     
            The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Lebanon said three of its members were killed. It is the first time a location within Beirut’s city’s limits has been hit in the current war.
     
            On October 7, Israeli Prime Minister’s Benjamin Netanyahu’s self-styled image as “Mister Security” seemed irrevocably shattered by the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The Jewish homeland and its leader had failed to protect the people. How could he possibly survive?
     
            The polls told us as much. He had formed an extremist coalition government in November 2022 on the back of the 32 seats his Likud party secured in the 120-seat Knesset. After Hamas’ attack, a string of opinion polls suggested that were elections held, Likud would get just 17 seats, putting the government’s long-term survival in jeopardy.
     
            Nearly a year later, Netanyahu has staged a remarkable turnaround. Though Likud would still struggle to form a government were elections held today, a brutal campaign of airstrikes in Lebanon and assassinations across the Middle East in recent weeks have buoyed the prime minister to heights unimaginable in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attacks almost a year ago.
     
            A poll released Sunday by Israel’s Channel 12 showed that Likud would win 25 seats were elections to be held today, making it the largest party. Netanyahu enjoys 38% support, according to the survey.
     
        “The regional confrontations are good for Netanyahu,” veteran pollster and analyst Dahlia Scheindlin told CNN. “They seem quite clearly to be the contributing factor to his recovery.”

            As Israel expands its war on multiple fronts in the region, strikes in Gaza have shown little sign of abating.
     
            Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed at least 20 Palestinians and injured another 108 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Health there. In total, at least 41,615 Palestinians have been killed and another 96,359 people wounded, the ministry reported on Monday.
     
            The ministry said a number of victims are still under debris and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them. At least 10,000 people are missing and believed to be entombed under rubble in Gaza, according to the Government Media Office there.
     
            Relief workers previously told CNN that damaged roads from Israeli strikes have impeded attempts to reach survivors.
     
            CNN is unable to independently confirm the health ministry’s data, which does not distinguish between combatant and civilian deaths.
     
            Despite the escalation in tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, oil prices dipped Monday as investors were chiefly worried about waning demand in China and a glut of supply globally.
     
            The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose slightly in early trade but ticked down 0.6% by 7.31 a.m. ET to stand just above $71. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, dropped 0.8% to trade at almost $68.
     
            That’s still well below the $88 and $86 levels the contracts hit respectively in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel last October.
     
            Israel’s recent airstrikes against Hezbollah and the Houthis do not “materially affect global oil supplies,” Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at Evelyn Partners in London, wrote in a note Monday.
     
            “However, should Israel strike deep within Iran at its nuclear facilities, then it could lead to a response from Tehran that disrupts the flow of oil and gas from the Middle East… (leading) to much higher oil prices,” he added.
     
            Concerns about weak oil demand in China, the world’s largest oil importer, have helped keep a lid on prices in recent months, as has record output from the United States.
     
            In June, the International Energy Agency said it expects growth in global oil production to “inflate the world’s spare (oil) capacity cushion” to levels seen only once before, during the coronavirus pandemic when oil prices crashed. By 2030, global oil supply will outstrip demand by a “staggering” 8 million barrels per day, the agency also predicted.
     
            Israel’s defense minister has given one of the clearest signs yet that his country intends to launch some form of ground incursion into Lebanon.
     
            “The elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not the final one,” Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops on Monday. “We will employ all the capabilities at our disposal, and if someone on the other side did not understand what those capabilities entail, we mean all capabilities, and you are part of this effort.”
     
            Gallant made the remarks while visiting the military’s armored corps in northern Israel, close to the Lebanese border, talking with soldiers serving in brigade 188 and the Golani brigade, an infantry unit.
     
            It is not the first time an Israeli official has made remarks pointing at such a possibility, but Gallant’s language on Monday took a more direct turn. It is the latest indication that Israel is creeping ever-closer to a ground offensive into southern Lebanon.
     
            Herzi Halevi, chief of the General Staff, last week told troops near Israel’s northern border that jets were striking Lebanon “to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.”
     
            Gallant said Monday that Israel was determined to return citizens forced from their homes in the north of the country.
     
            “We are prepared to make every effort necessary to accomplish this mission,” he said. “We will use all the means that may be required – your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land. Good luck.”
     
            An estimated 100,000 people have crossed the Lebanese border back into Syria since Israel started striking Lebanon, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) told CNN.
     
            UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh described the attacks on Lebanon over the last week of September as “the most intense” since 2006.
     
            Some of those fleeing the country have been directly injured in the strikes.
     
        “Last week our colleagues saw a woman crossing carrying two dead children that she intended to bury in Syria.”
     
        Matthew Saltmarsh, UNHCR spokesperson
     
            “The Lebanese have become all too used to their country being a battleground. Refugees who have fled Syria in search of safety and security are now facing the reality of being displaced once again in Lebanon due to ongoing hostilities,” he added.
     
            Most of estimated 100,000 people to have crossed from Lebanon to Syria are women and children, according to UNHCR.
     
            “Among arrivals, some 80% are Syrians and 20% Lebanese,” Saltmarsh said.
     
            “They are exhausted, scared and in need, arriving in a country that has been suffering from its own crisis and violence for more than 13 years, as well as from economic collapse,” he added.
     
            Islam Hijazy, an aid worker who was shot dead in a suspected case of mistaken identity in southern Gaza on Friday, was a “dedicated, hardworking, compassionate” humanitarian and a “proud Arab Palestinian woman,” according to her colleague.
     
            Steve Sosebee, the founder of HEAL Palestine, told CNN he had worked with Hijazy for more than a decade. “She was the mother of two children, that brought her the most joy in life,” he added.
     
            The Israeli offensive displaced Hijazy and her children, Maria and Mohamed, several times, Sosebee said. They fled northern Gaza in the early days of the war, he said, separating her from her husband, who was unable to travel.
     
            “Under bombing by tanks, she escaped with her children, carrying one in each arm, and tanks were firing at the neighborhood, and she lost her shoe, and was so scared that she fled and did not go back to get it.”
     
            Before she was killed by a group of armed men, according to witnesses, Hijazy had told Sosebee the challenges of raising children under Israel’s bombardment, which has triggered mass displacement into tent camps. “She was talking about the tent that her and her family were living in. (It) was flooded from the rains.
     
        She saw death everywhere. Her children are highly traumatized from their experiences, all of Gaza’s children are. Islam was just a woman in Gaza, like many other Gazans, whose life has been completely upended by this terrible, terrible crisis.”

            Hezbollah will choose a leader to succeed Hassan Nasrallah – who was killed by an Israeli strike in Beirut on Friday – “as soon as possible,” the group’s highest-ranking official said in a televised speech on Monday.
     
        “We will choose a secretary general for the party as soon as possible and according to the mechanism previously adopted by the party. And we will fill the leadership positions. Be reassured that the options will be easy,” Naim Qassim said in the group’s first public address since Nasrallah’s assassination.
     
 
            Hezbollah’s highest-ranking official Naim Qassim vowed to continue the group’s mission to fight Israel and defend Palestinians despite losses incurred by the group in Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s claims about having hit most of the group’s medium- and long-range missiles is a “dream that they have not achieved nor will they achieve,” he said.
     
        “We are ready if Israel decides to enter through land and the resistance is ready for a clash.”
     
 
        “All the sacrifices that we have gone through, beginning with the pagers, to the martyrdom of our leaders and the martyrdom of our secretary general… would shake armies, populations and organization, yet we continue. With the pains of these days, with the sacrifices, we continue.”
     
 
            Hezbollah will continue its “targets and field goals” as laid out by Nasrallah, he said.
     
        “The Islamic resistance will continue confronting the Israeli enemy in support of Gaza and Palestine, and to defend Lebanon and its population, and in response to the assassinations and the killing of civilians,” he said.
     
 
            This is the first public address by a figure from the group since the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Hezbollah’s highest-ranking official is giving a televised statement, the first public address by a figure from the group since the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
Naim Qassim, who was a candidate to lead Hezbollah before Nasrallah’s appointment, is known for his religious knowledge and scholastic prowess. Born in 1953 in the southern Lebanese village of Kfar Kila, Qassim is a well-known member of the old guard. The 71-year-old Shiite cleric helped found Hezbollah in 1982, and has served seven consecutive terms as deputy secretary-general since 1991. He also oversees the group’s parliamentary activities.
     
            He was the group’s second-in-command before Nasrallah was assassinated, often appearing in media interviews. In 2015, he wrote the book “Hezbollah: The Story from Within,” which laid out the group’s political ideology.
     
            Hezbollah’s longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed Friday in an Israeli airstrike on his underground headquarters in Beirut — a significant escalation in the war.
     
            A series of loud explosions rang out and smoke rose from the city’s southern suburbs. Images broadcast on local TV showed a huge crater where six buildings had been, as rescuers navigated the rubble. The strikes crushed residential buildings that sunk beneath the ground, leaving a crater bigger than the size of a soccer field.
     
            Footage of the level of damage indicated that Israel had used 2,000-pound bombs, a weapons expert told CNN.
     
            Syrian refugees who once came to Lebanon fleeing violence are returning home to the unknown.
     
            Roughly 100,000 people — both Lebanese and Syrian nationals — have crossed into Syria to flee Israeli airstrikes, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said.
     
            Israel’s intensified bombardment has displaced one million people in Lebanon, the country’s caretaker prime minister said.
     
            About 1.5 million Syrian refugees live in Lebanon, according to the UNHCR.
     
        “They came to Lebanon to look for safety. Now they have to live through that experience again,” said Rula Amin, senior spokesperson for UNHCR Middle East and North Africa.
     
 
            “It’s a total tragic situation,” Amin told CNN’s Michael Holmes.
     
            Israel’s targets in Lebonon are constantly changing, making it hard for civilians to find safe spaces to shelter. Residents have been told to avoid areas where Hezbollah operates, but because the group operates in secret, they don’t know where to go.
     
            A lack of shelters means many civilians have resorted to sleeping in the open air, Amin said.
     
        “We have not seen anything like this before, even in 2006,” said Amin. “The amount and the intensity of the bombings, the areas targeted. There is a huge loss of lives especially amongst civilians.”
     
 
            Lebanese authorities say more than 1,000 people have been killed.
     
            Amin said UNHCR staff on the Syrian-Lebanese border are seeing thousands of people crossing into Syria every day.
     
        “They don’t know what the plan is for tomorrow. All they know is they have to run.”

            One million people in Lebanon have “moved from place to place in just a few days,” the country’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Monday as Israeli strikes in the country continue.
     
        “We must not forget the significant displacement movement that occurred from the south, the suburbs, and the Bekaa in just a few hours,” Mikati said, calling it the “largest displacement operation” that occurred “within a matter of hours.”
     
 
            Mikati said the situation poses issues related to managing food and shelter for those displaced as well as public health and waste management.
     
            Killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was a step toward changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Saturday.
     
            Israel’s leader sees an opportunity opening up for a fundamental reconfiguration of power in Middle East and he may assume that Hezbollah are mortally wounded. Total victory, however, is elusive, and those who get what they wish for often live to regret it.
     
            Since September 17, Israel has dealt the Iran-backed militant group one body blow after another in Lebanon. By Friday evening – when Nasrallah was killed in a bombing that flattened multiple buildings – Hezballah’s senior leadership had been almost totally eliminated.
     
            Yet recent history offers only bitter lessons for Israeli leaders — and others — who entertain grand ambitions for tectonic changes in Lebanon, and in the Middle East in general.
     
            In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the goal of crushing the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Beyond that, it hoped to establish a malleable Christian-dominated government in Beirut and to drive Syrian forces out of the country.
     
            It failed at all three. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the 1982 Israeli invasion was the birth of Hezbollah, which went on to wage a relentless guerrilla war that compelled Israel to unilaterally withdraw from southern Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah went on to fight Israel to a standstill in the 2006 war, and in the following years grew only stronger, with significant Iranian help.
     
            Today Hezbollah is crippled and in disarray, and clearly infiltrated by Israeli intelligence – but still, it would be premature to write its epitaph.
     
Read the full analysis.
 
            Hezbollah’s continued losses in its war with Israel have created a disastrous situation for Tehran, according to Michael Eisenstadt, director of The Washington Institute’s Military and Security Studies Program.
     
        Iran’s “preferred way of war is to operate through proxies, and Hezbollah was always the diamond in their crown,” he told CNN’s Michael Holmes.
     
 
            “It played a major role both in their struggle against Israel and their efforts to create what they call ‘the axis of resistance’ in the region,” he said, referring to the alliance of Islamist militias across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen who give Iran strategic depth against its enemies.
     
        “This is a setback that will take many years, if not decades to recover from,” Eisenstadt said.
     
 
            How – or if – Tehran will respond remains unclear.
     
            While this will be a difficult situation for Iran to step back from, it has in the past been known to abandon its allies to their fate, Eisenstadt said.
     
            Iran has also been put in a vulnerable place with one of its main proxies significantly weakened, he said.
     
        “I think they’ll probably be very careful going forward.”
     
 
            Hamas on Monday announced that its leader in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif, also known as Abu Al-Amin, was killed alongside multiple members of his family in an Israeli strike on the south of the country.
     
        Hamas described Sharif as “leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in Lebanon and a member of the movement’s leadership abroad.”
     
 
            The group said his wife, son and daughter were also killed in the same strike, which it said took place in the El Buss refugee camp, on the outskirts of the city of Tyre.
     
            It was not immediately clear how senior Sharif was within Hamas. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            The Israeli air force has launched strikes in Lebanon overnight, particularly in the Bekaa valley and southern Lebanon, both Hezbollah strongholds.
     
            The military says it struck locations “including dozens of launchers and buildings in which Hezbollah weapons were stored” in the Bekaa valley.
     
            Lebanon’s national news agency said overnight Israeli strikes targeted areas in the city of Baalbe and villages of Nabi Chit, Alhamoudiyeh, Nabha, the city of Hermel and its surroundings, in the Bekaa valley.
     
            The Israeli military also said it has struck “infrastructure sites used by Hezbollah” in southern Lebanon.
     
            The Biden administration is worried that an attack from Iran is being planned in the wake of Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and is working with Israel on defenses, a US official said Sunday night.
     
            Joint defenses are being prepared to ward off an attack with changes in US military posture, the official added.
     
            The Biden administration spearheaded a multi-national defense of Israel in mid-April when Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel in response to the Israeli bombing of senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers in Syria.
     
            The US official declined to say what kind of attack is expected from Iran or specify the moves the US military is making.
     
            Fears of a broader regional war in the Middle East have spiked in recent weeks as Israel intensifies its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Iran-backed group vows to continue its fight, even as a growing number of its top commander have been killed.
     
            Nasrallah was killed in a massive Israeli bombing in southern Beirut on Friday. He led the most powerful of Iran’s Middle East proxies for decades and his death is a potentially crippling setback for Hezbollah as well as a major blow to Iran’s control in the region.
     
Read the full story.
 
Airstrikes hit Beirut early Monday — the first time strikes have landed within the city limits since October 7 — following a weekend of fighting on multiple fronts in the Middle East.
     
            Israel expanded its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, stoking fears of a regional war, as Hezbollah pledged to continue fighting even as it faces growing losses in its senior ranks.
     
Here’s what you need to know:﻿
 
            • Israeli strikes killed over 100 people and wounded over 350 others in Lebanon on Sunday. The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah, including in attacks by fighter jets on about 45 targets near a village in southern Lebanon.
     
            • Hezbollah’s leadership is shrinking, with at least three senior commanders confirmed killed Sunday, including Nabil Qaouk, a key commander and member of Hezbollah’s central council. Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed Friday in a strike on the group’s underground headquarters, where 20 Hezbollah members were also present, including the head of Nasrallah’s security unit.
     
            • Israel’s military also struck what it said were power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis in Yemen, killing at least four people and wounding dozens more. The Houthis, like Hamas and Hezbollah, are among the Iran-backed militant groups battling Israel since the war in Gaza began.
     
            • Aid warnings: An escalation of the conflict in Lebanon would have “extremely dire consequences” for the already deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, the aid agency Relief International said on Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced onto the streets as Israeli strikes destroy homes and infrastructure.
     
            • US President Joe Biden said he is “working like hell” with allies to prevent an all-out war in the Middle East. Before Nasrallah’s killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the US.
     
            Airstrikes hit Beirut in the early hours of Monday morning, the first time strikes have landed within the city limits of the Lebanese capital in the current war.
     
            Videos geolocated by CNN show chaotic scenes on the streets of Beirut following the strike. The footage shows the strikes hit near Cola — a major intersection in the city.
     
Some context: Until now Israel’s airstrikes on the Beirut have focused on the southern part of the city, the densely populated and predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah have a stronghold.
     
            The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Lebanon has said three of its members have been killed in the airstrike.
     
            The armed group said those killed were Mohammed Abed Al-Al, a member of its political bureau and head of the military-security department, Imad Odeh, a member of its military department and military command in Lebanon, and Abdul Rahman Abed Al-Al.
     
        PFLP pledged to “continue the path of struggle and resistance until the occupation will be swept away no matter how long it takes, and no matter how great the sacrifices.”
     
 
            The Israeli military told CNN they are looking into the incident.
     
            Deadly fighting between Israel and Iran-backed militant groups has ramped up in recent weeks as the Israeli military expands its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
     
            Along with Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah and the Houthis are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” an alliance of Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen. The proxies give Iran strategic depth against its enemies.
     
            In support of Hamas and Palestinians, Hezbollah and the Houthis have launched regular attacks on Israel over the past year. They have vowed to keep fighting until the war in Gaza ends.
     
Here’s what to know about the groups:
 
Hezbollah: The Lebanese group is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. The Shiite group emerged out of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years before it was driven out by Hezbollah. In 2006, Hezbollah and Israel fought a war for 34 days, which ended with no clear victor.
     
The Houthis: The Shiite group, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology, has been fighting Saudi-backed forces for more than a decade in Yemen’s civil war. While the Houthis do not pose as much of a threat to Israel as Hamas and Hezbollah, they have wreaked havoc over the past year in the Red Sea, where they have launched strikes at commercial ships they deemed linked to Israel and its allies, threatening to choke global trade.
     
Hamas: The group emerged in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist group from Egypt. Hamas considers Israel’s existence as illegitimate and seeks its destruction. It receives funding, weapons and training from Iran.
     
            The US has designated Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations.
     
Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the length of Israel’s occupation in southern Lebanon. It was 18 years. The description of the goals of Hamas has also been updated to more accurately convey their meaning.
 
            US President Joe Biden says he’ll speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon as tensions in the Middle East increase following Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            “Yes, I will be talking to him,” Biden said Sunday as he headed for the White House from Dover Air Force Base.
     
            He added “we really have to avoid” all-out war in the Middle East, saying, “We’ve already taken precautions relative to our embassies and personnel who want to leave, but we’re not there yet. But we’re working like hell with the French and many others.”
     
Some background: Before Nasrallah’s killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States and France that called for a 21-day pause in fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border, infuriating American officials who had been led to believe he was on board.
     
            Israel informed the US it was launching its major operation in Beirut only after it was underway — again, to the frustration of some American officials.
     
            Already at odds with Netanyahu over the nearly yearlong war in Gaza, Biden is now working to calm two fronts at a moment when his influence on Netanyahu’s decision-making appears to be at an all-time low.
     
CNN’s Kevin Liptak and MJ Lee contributed reporting to this post.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to bring former rival Gideon Sa’ar into his government is intended to shore up his domestic power base, analysts say.
     
            Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who worked closely with Netanyahu, told CNN that the move was intended to have three effects:
     
            Netanyahu announced Sunday that Sa’ar would join the government as a minister without portfolio.
     
            Sa’ar said Sunday that “there is no point in continuing to sit in the opposition, in a situation where the positions of most of its members on the subject of the war are different and even far from my position. This is a time when it is my duty to try and contribute at the decision-making table.”

            • Airstrikes have landed within Beirut’s city limits for the first time since October 7. The attack comes days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The escalation in the war has killed civilians, destroyed homes and displaced hundreds of thousands in Lebanon.
     
            • Hezbollah says it will continue to fight, even as a growing number of senior figures have been killed. The Iran-backed group continues to fire rockets into northern Israel, where one of Israel’s war aims is to return 60,000 residents displaced by the fighting.
     
            • Ramping up its attacks on multiple fronts, Israel has also launched long-range strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen, another militant group in Iran’s alliance of proxies that it has been battling since declaring war against Hamas in Gaza.
     
            • US officials, who are still pressing for a ceasefire, see the possibility of a limited Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon but stress that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not appear to have made a decision.
     
Our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hezbollah has moved here.
 
Airstrikes hit Beirut early Monday — the first time strikes have landed within the city limits since October 7 — following a weekend of fighting on multiple fronts in the Middle East.
     
            Israel expanded its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, stoking fears of a regional war, as Hezbollah pledged to continue fighting even as it faces growing losses in its senior ranks.
     
Here’s what you need to know:﻿
 
            • Israeli strikes killed over 100 people and wounded over 350 others in Lebanon on Sunday. The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah, including in attacks by fighter jets on about 45 targets near a village in southern Lebanon.
     
            • Hezbollah’s leadership is shrinking, with at least three senior commanders confirmed killed Sunday, including Nabil Qaouk, a key commander and member of Hezbollah’s central council. Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed Friday in a strike on the group’s underground headquarters, where 20 Hezbollah members were also present, including the head of Nasrallah’s security unit.
     
            • Israel’s military also struck what it said were power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis in Yemen, killing at least four people and wounding dozens more. The Houthis, like Hamas and Hezbollah, are among the Iran-backed militant groups battling Israel since the war in Gaza began.
     
            • Aid warnings: An escalation of the conflict in Lebanon would have “extremely dire consequences” for the already deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, the aid agency Relief International said on Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced onto the streets as Israeli strikes destroy homes and infrastructure.
     
            • US President Joe Biden said he is “working like hell” with allies to prevent an all-out war in the Middle East. Before Nasrallah’s killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the US.
     
            Deadly fighting between Israel and Iran-backed militant groups has ramped up in recent weeks as the Israeli military expands its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
     
            Along with Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah and the Houthis are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance,” an alliance of Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen. The proxies give Iran strategic depth against its enemies.
     
            In support of Hamas and Palestinians, Hezbollah and the Houthis have launched regular attacks on Israel over the past year. They have vowed to keep fighting until the war in Gaza ends.
     
Here’s what to know about the groups: 
 
Hezbollah: The Lebanese group is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. The Shiite group emerged out of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years before it was driven out by Hezbollah. In 2006, Hezbollah and Israel fought a war for 34 days, which ended with no clear victor.
     
The Houthis: The Shiite group, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology, has been fighting Saudi-backed forces for more than a decade in Yemen’s civil war. While the Houthis do not pose as much of a threat to Israel as Hamas and Hezbollah, they have wreaked havoc over the past year in the Red Sea, where they have launched strikes at commercial ships they deemed linked to Israel and its allies, threatening to choke global trade.
     
Hamas: The group emerged in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist group from Egypt. Hamas considers Israel an occupying power and its goal is to liberate the Palestinian territories. Hamas receives funding, weapons and training from Iran.
     
            The US has designated Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations.
     
Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the length of Israel’s occupation in southern Lebanon. It was 18 years. The description of the goals of Hamas has also been updated to more accurately convey their meaning.
 
            Airstrikes hit Beirut in the early hours of Monday morning, the first time a strike landed within the Lebanese capital’s city limits in the current war.
     
            The strikes hit near Cola Bridge, a major intersection in the city, according to videos geolocated by CNN, causing widespread damage to residential apartment buildings and other city infrastructure.
     
            The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Lebanon has said three of its members have been killed in an airstrike on Beirut in the early hours of Monday.
     
            The strike near the Cola Bridge, a major intersection in the city, is the first time a location within the Lebanese capital’s city limits has been hit in the current war.
     
            The armed group said those killed were Mohammed Abed Al-Al, a member of its political bureau and head of the military-security department, Imad Odeh, a member of its military department and military command in Lebanon, and Abdul Rahman Abed Al-Al.
     
        PFLP pledged to “continue the path of struggle and resistance until the occupation will be swept away no matter how long it takes, and no matter how great the sacrifices.” 
     
 
            The Israeli military told CNN they are looking into the incident.
     
            Saudi Arabia has expressed “great concern” over the developments taking place in Lebanon and stressed that Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected.
     
        “The Kingdom calls on the international community to assume its responsibilities towards protecting regional peace and security to spare the region and its people the dangers and tragedies of wars,” the foreign ministry said Monday.
     
 
            Saudi Arabia will also provide medical and relief assistance to the Lebanese population, according to Saudi Press Agency.
     
            The country has also formed a global alliance to push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the country’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week, according to state media.
     
            Airstrikes hit Beirut in the early hours of Monday morning, marking the first time strikes landed within the city limits of the Lebanese capital since the war started last October.
     
            Videos geolocated by CNN show chaotic scenes on the streets of Beirut following the strike. The footage shows the strikes hit near Cola Bridge - a major intersection in the city.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel  Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
     
Some context: Until now Israel’s airstrikes on the Beirut have focused on the southern part of the city, the densely populated and predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah have a stronghold.
     
            At least 105 people were killed and 359 injured in Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon on Sunday, according to the country’s health ministry.
     
            The highest death toll was in the South Governorate, where 48 people were killed and 168 were injured in Ain Al-Delb and Tyre. The ministry added that Israeli airstrikes caused “severe damage” to Kana hospital in the south.
     
            The Baalbek-Hermel region in eastern Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley was also hard hit, with 33 people killed and 97 injured, according to the ministry.
     
            There were also heavy casualties in the country’s southern Nabatiyeh Governorate, including in the town of Marjaayoun.
     
            Israel has said that its intensified strikes on Lebanon this weekend are targeting Hezbollah operatives and facilities, and accuses the militant group of using civilians as “human shields.” The strikes have flattened residential buildings and devastated public infrastructure, leading to a deepening humanitarian crisis in the country.
     
            US President Joe Biden says he’ll speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon as tensions in the Middle East increase following Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            “Yes, I will be talking to him,” Biden said Sunday as he headed for the White House from Dover Air Force Base.
     
            He added “we really have to avoid” all-out war in the Middle East, saying, “We’ve already taken precautions relative to our embassies and personnel who want to leave, but we’re not there yet. But we’re working like hell with the French and many others.”
     
Some background: Before Nasrallah’s killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States and France that called for a 21-day pause in fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border, infuriating American officials who had been led to believe he was on board.
     
            Israel informed the US it was launching its major operation in Beirut only after it was underway — again, to the frustration of some American officials.
     
            Already at odds with Netanyahu over the nearly yearlong war in Gaza, Biden is now working to calm two fronts at a moment when his influence on Netanyahu’s decision-making appears to be at an all-time low.

            As we continue our coverage of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, here’s a reminder of what happened on Sunday:
     
            • More than 100 people were killed and over 350 others injured by Israeli strikes in Lebanon today, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah targets throughout the day, including attacks by fighter jets on about 45 targets near a village in southern Lebanon.
     
            • At least three senior Hezbollah commanders were confirmed killed Sunday, including Nabil Qaouk, a key commander and member of Hezbollah’s central council. The Israel Defense Forces said more than 20 Hezbollah members of varying ranks were present at an underground headquarters where a strike on Friday killed the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. It named several more of them on Sunday, including Ibrahim Hussein Jazini, the head of Nasrallah’s security unit, and others who worked closely with him.
     
            • Israel has also struck what it said were facilities used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Israeli Air Force targeted power plants and a seaport in the attack, according to a statement from the IDF. At least four people, including a port worker and three engineers, were killed and 45 others wounded, according to Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV. The Houthis, like Hamas and Hezbollah, are among the Iran-backed militant groups that are central to rising fears of a broader regional war in the Middle East.
     
            • Aid warnings: An escalation of the conflict in Lebanon would have “extremely dire consequences” for the already deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, the aid agency Relief International said on Sunday. Tens of thousands of people have been forced onto the streets as Israeli strikes destroy residential buildings and key infrastructure.
     
            • Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu is bringing a former rival, Gideon Sa’ar, into the government as a minister without portfolio, he announced Sunday evening. The move is intended to shore up his domestic power base, analysts say.
     
This post has been updated with the latest death toll from Lebanese authorities.
 
            Clashes took place Sunday evening in Pakistan’s largest city of Karachi as local police tried to disperse protesters who marched towards the city’s US Consulate to mourn the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Video on social media showed police firing tear gas and warning shots, with protesters throwing stones and trying to cross barriers blocking access to the US Consulate.
     
            The protests were led by the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen, a Pakistani Shi’a Islamic political organization which told CNN that their nationwide protests were “peaceful.”
     
            According to a statement by the Karachi Police, the demonstrators had tried to move beyond the allocated protest venue and resorted to “throwing stones and rioting.”
     
            A separate rally also took place in the capital city of Islamabad, where around 4,000 people gathered to protest Israel’s assassination of Nasrallah.
     
            Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement Sunday evening condemning the killing as “reckless act” and a “major escalation in an already volatile region.”
     
Remember: Nasrallah was one of the founders of Hezbollah, which formed four decades ago and became the most powerful Iranian proxy in its axis of aligned militant groups spread across Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq. He was revered by a loyal base of followers as a religious and political leader.
     
            The US and much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, holding Nasrallah and the organization responsible for its bloody attacks over the last 40 years.
     
            At least 58 people have been killed and 110 injured in Israeli airstrikes in two different areas in Lebanon on Sunday, according to an update by the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            In the southern Lebanese village of Ain al-Delb, the ministry reported that at least 32 people were killed and 53 others were injured.
     
            The ministry said at least five people were killed and 10 others injured in strikes on the town of Bint Jbeil, also in the south of the country.
     
            At least 21 people were killed and 47 others injured in the Baalbek-Hermel region in eastern Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, the ministry said.
     
This post has been updated with the latest toll from Lebanon’s health ministry.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to bring former rival Gideon Sa’ar into his government is intended to shore up his domestic power base, analysts say.
     
            Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who worked closely with Netanyahu, told CNN that the move was intended to have three effects:
     
            Netanyahu announced Sunday that Sa’ar would join the government as a minister without portfolio.
     
            Sa’ar said Sunday that “there is no point in continuing to sit in the opposition, in a situation where the positions of most of its members on the subject of the war are different and even far from my position. This is a time when it is my duty to try and contribute at the decision-making table.”
     
More background: Prior to Israel’s escalated war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Netanyahu had intended to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and elevate Sa’ar to the position. Sa’ar has little national security experience, and the scheme to appoint him defense minister drew widespread ridicule from national security heavyweights. “It’ll take him months on end to train for the job,” Gadi Eisenkot, a highly respected former Israeli military chief and member of the opposition, said at the time.
     
            Sa’ar quit Netanyahu’s Likud party in 2020 to form his own party, New Hope, but failed to find a stable support base. He joined the emergency government after October 7, but quit this spring. He had since then been in talks with Netanyahu to re-join the government for some time.
     
            At least four people, including a port worker and three engineers, have been killed and 45 others wounded following Israeli airstrikes on Al-Hali power station in Hodeidah, Yemen, according to Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV.
     
            Rescue teams are searching for missing people under the rubble.
     
            The Israeli military confirmed earlier Sunday that it had targeted positions in Yemen, including power plants and a seaport in Ras Issa and Hodeidah. Israel claimed the targets were being used by the Houthis, one of the Iran-backed militant groups aligned against Israel.
     
            Houthi spokesperson Mohammad Abdul Salam said the strike hit “civilian facilities.” Salam called the attack an “attempt to break Yemen’s decision to support Gaza” but said Yemenis would remain committed in their support.
     
Remember: The Houthi rebel group has stepped up its attacks in key Red Sea shipping lanes during the war in Gaza, saying it is doing so in support of Palestinians.
     
            The killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has marked another major escalation in the Middle East and deepened fears of a wider regional war involving Iran and its various proxy groups.
     
            Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu is bringing a former rival, Gideon Sa’ar, into the government as a minister without portfolio, he announced Sunday evening.
     
            Analysts say the move is intended to shore up his domestic power base.
     
            Netanyahu said during a news conference that unity was important to achieve the country’s war goals.
     
            Prior to Israel’s escalated war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Netanyahu had intended to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and elevate Sa’ar to the position.
     
            Sa’ar has little national security experience, and the scheme drew widespread ridicule from national security heavyweights.

            At least 45 people have been killed and 76 injured in Israeli airstrikes on two different areas in Lebanon on Sunday, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            In the southern Lebanese village of Ain al-Delb, the ministry reported that at least 24 people died, and 29 others were injured.
     
            At least 21 people were killed and 47 others injured in the Baalbek-Hermel region in eastern Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, the ministry said.
     
            Tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians have been forced onto the streets by Israel’s intensified bombardment in recent days. Residential buildings have been flattened and key infrastructure has been destroyed as Israel strikes what it says are Hezbollah targets embedded in civilian areas.
     
            Israel has launched airstrikes at the Yemeni ports of Hodeidah and Ras Isa.
     
            The Israeli Air Force targeted power plants and a seaport in the attack, according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces.
     
            Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported on the strikes Sunday, confirming they had targeted the ports and the Al-Hali and Ras Katheeb electrical stations.
     
            “Through the attacked infrastructure and ports, the Houthi regime transfers Iranian weapons to the region, and supplies for military needs, and thus also oil,” the IDF said in the statement.
     
            It added that the attack was “in response to the latest attacks carried out by the Houthi regime against the State of Israel.”
     
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a social media post that he had followed the attack from an Air Force control room. Gallant vowed “no place is too far” for Israel’s reach.
     
            IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi later echoed that sentiment, saying the strikes “carry a message” that the military “knows how to reach even farther, and we know how to strike there with precision.”
     
Remember: The Houthis, like Hezbollah and Hamas, are among the Iranian proxy groups aligned against Israel.
     
            Clashes involving the Iran-backed groups have increased since Hamas’ October 7 attacks and the ensuing Israeli military offensive in Gaza, with the Houthis saying their attacks on vessels in key shipping lanes are made in solidarity with the Palestinians.
     
            The killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has marked another major escalation in the Middle East and deepened fears of a wider regional war involving Iran and the various militant groups.
     
This post has been updated with comments from Israeli officials.
 
            The Israeli military said its fighter jets attacked about 45 targets near a village in southern Lebanon on Sunday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said the strikes targeted the “Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Kafra village.”
     
            Kafra is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
     
            The targets included weapons warehouses and other infrastructure, the IDF said.
     
            While “nobody’s mourning Nasrallah’s death, we certainly do mourn any loss of civilian life,” US national security spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” after the Israeli strike in a densely populated neighborhood of Beirut killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
        “I don’t think anybody’s mourning the loss of Mr. Nasrallah, a known terrorist, a guy with American blood on his hands, as well as Israeli blood on his hands. This is a terrorist organization. He was the leader of it. And I think people are safer without him walking around,” Kirby said.
     
 
            When asked what the civilian death toll of the strike was, Kirby said, “We can’t quantify that right now.”
     
            “We’re in touch with our Israeli counterparts about that. Each single civilian death is a tragedy. And, certainly, while, again, nobody’s mourning Nasrallah’s death, we certainly do mourn any loss of civilian life,” Kirby said.
     
            Over 1,000 people have been killed since Israel’s attacks in Lebanon escalated last week, according to the Lebanese government. The strike that killed Nasrallah came in a series of blasts that flattened residential buildings in a crowded part of Beirut’s southern suburbs. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using civilians as “human shields.”
     
            While Kirby would not comment on Israel’s decision-making process, he stressed the United States and President Joe Biden are continuing to push for diplomacy and a ceasefire.
     
            “I think what we would agree on is that there needs to be an effort to de-escalate here,” he said.
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed that another senior figure in the militant group, Ali Karki, was killed in the massive Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on Friday.
     
            Hezbollah said that Karki was killed alongside the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Karki had been the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front forces for the last year, Hezbollah said, and had fought in previous confrontations with Israel in 2000 and 2006.
     
            On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces said that more than 20 Hezbollah members “of varying ranks, who were present at the underground headquarters in Beirut” had been killed, including Ibrahim Hussein Jazini — the head of Nasrallah’s security unit.
     
            Samir Tawfiq Dib — a long-time adviser to Nasrallah — was also killed, as was Ali Naaf Ayoub, responsible for coordinating Hezbollah’s firepower, according to the IDF.
     
            The IDF said that Jazini and Dib “were among Nasrallah’s closest associates.”
     
            There has been no word from Hezbollah on the deaths of those identified Sunday by the Israeli military.
     
            Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was a path toward resistance and dignity.
     
            Assad’s first comments on Nasrallah’s killing were published Sunday by Syrian state news agency SANA.
     
            In a message to the Lebanese National Resistance, as well as Nasrallah’s family, al-Assad said that “resistance is an idea and a doctrine, and the martyr Nasrallah is its memory and history.”
     
            “He will never be just a legend, but rather a path that continues to create a reality whose core is resistance and whose essence is dignity,” al-Assad continued.
     
Some background: Nasrallah was one of the founders of Hezbollah, which formed four decades ago and became the most powerful Iranian proxy in its axis of aligned militant groups spread across Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq.
     
            In Lebanon, Hezbollah is considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, and Nasrallah was revered by a loyal base of followers as a religious and political leader.
     
            The US and much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, holding Nasrallah and the organization responsible for its bloody attacks over the last 40 years.
     
US strikes in Syria: Separately, the US Central Command said it killed at least 37 members of ISIS and al Qaeda in two strikes on parts of Syria this month. The operatives killed included a senior lead of an al Qaeda affiliate overseeing military operations in the country, and “at least four senior leaders” at an ISIS training camp in central Syria.
     
CNN’s Aileen Graef contributed reporting to this post. 
 
            An Israeli airstrike on a school compound in northern Gaza has killed at least four people, according to Gaza Civil Defense.
     
            A number of people were also injured, it said. Casualties were being taken to Kamal Adwan Hospital, according to its director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya.
     
            The strike was carried out on Umm al-Fahm school in Beit Lahia.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces claimed that Hamas had established a “command and control center embedded inside a compound that previously served as the ‘Umm al-Fahm’ School.”
     
            The IDF said that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.”
     
Remember: While Israel is at war with Hezbollah to its north, it continues its months-long military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and there remains a spiraling humanitarian crisis.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been in conflict for decades, but clashes across the Lebanon-Israel border intensified after Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel. In the time since, fears have grown that the fighting could grow into a broader regional conflict involving Israel, Iran and its proxy groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah.
     
            Hezbollah acknowledged Sunday that Nabil Qaouk, the commander of its Preventive Security Unit and a member of Hezbollah’s central council, has been killed.
     
            It said in a statement that it confirmed “the martyrdom of the esteemed mujahid scholar Sheikh Nabil Qaouk,” who had been killed in an Israeli raid on the Chyah area on the outskirts of Beirut. It gave no further details.
     
            Hezbollah said that Qaouk had been “consistently present in the arenas of jihad, close to the mujahideen on the front lines.”
     
            Israel had announced earlier Sunday that it killed Qaouk, with the country’s military describing him as “directly engaged in promoting terrorist designs against the State of Israel and its citizens, even in recent days.”
     
            The United States designated Qaouk a global terrorist in October 2020, saying he had represented Hezbollah at events commemorating deceased Hezbollah terrorists as well as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in a US drone strike in January 2020.
     
            The Israeli military says that Hezbollah continued to fire rockets across the border Sunday.
     
            In a brief statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that following sirens in the western Galilee and HaAmakim areas, “approximately 10 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted.”
     
            It also said that over the past few hours, IDF fighter jets “struck Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon, including launchers directed toward Israeli territory, weapons storage facilities, and terrorist infrastructure sites.”
     
            Earlier Sunday, the IDF said multiple projectiles had been fired into Israel from Lebanon, landing in open areas near the northern city of Tiberias.
     
            The Israeli military says it has carried out another strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, which have seen multiple airstrikes on the area in the last few days.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said in a brief statement that it “conducted a precise strike” in the Dahiyeh area.
     
            A CNN team in Beirut heard the explosion from some distance away, and smoke could be seen rising in the area.
     
            Israel’s killing of a senior commander from Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) “will not go unanswered,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday.
     
Abbas Nilforoushan was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut, Lebanon on Friday, alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and a number of other Hezbollah commanders.
     
            “There is no doubt that this horrible crime committed by the Zionist regime will not go unanswered,” Araghchi said in a statement.
     
            The speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, said Sunday that Iran-aligned armed groups would continue to confront Israel after the killing of Nasrallah.
     
            “We will not hesitate to go to any level in order to help the resistance,” Qalibaf said.
     
            He also claimed that the US is “complicit in all of these crimes and… has to accept the repercussions.”
     
            The body of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was recovered on Saturday, a Lebanese security source told CNN Sunday.
     
            He added that the corpse was in one piece.
     
            An escalation of the conflict in Lebanon would have “extremely dire consequences” for the already deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, the aid agency Relief International said on Sunday.
     
            Giacomo Lapo Baldini, Lebanon Country Director for Relief International, told CNN that the aid sector’s capacity in the country is already “limited,” as around one million people have been displaced by Israeli attacks.
     
            Around 300,000 people don’t have access to clean water after facilities were hit by Israel, Baldini said. Lebanese citizens are also in major need of bedding and mental health services, he added.
     
        “It’s the collective trauma, the psychological distress, that these people have been facing in a situation in which the capacity to respond… is very limited,” Baldini said. “There are approximately three psychiatrists for every 100,000 people, so the number is insufficient to cope with this need, and this was before the crisis.”
     
 
            On Sunday, the World Food Programme (WFP) launched an emergency project to scale up food assistance for those in need in Lebanon, setting up kitchens and food distribution centers in several parts of the country. But the aid accounts for just 66,000 people, a small fraction of those affected.
     
            “Lebanon is at a breaking point and cannot endure another war,” Corinne Fleischer, WFP Regional Director for the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe, said.
     
            Pope Francis on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon amid the “intensification of the conflict” between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Addressing the crowd during the Angelus prayer, following a mass for 40,000 people at the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels, Belgium, Pope Francis said he is following “with pain and with great concern the widening, the intensification of the conflict in Lebanon.”
     
            “Lebanon is a message, but at this moment it is a tormented message. This war has devastating effects on the population,” Francis said.
     
            “Let us pray for peace. I ask all parties to immediately cease fire in Lebanon, in Gaza, in the rest of Palestine, in Israel. Let the hostages be released and humanitarian aid be allowed,” he added.
     
On asymmetrical war: When asked later Sunday about the Israeli airstrikes on Israel and Gaza, Francis called countries which use disproportionate force in response to a threat “immoral.”
     
        “If it is disproportionate, you see a tendency to dominate that goes beyond what is moral,” the Pope told reporters on the flight from Brussels to Rome. He said he didn’t know the details of what has happened in Lebanon but insisted that “defense must always be proportional to that attack.”
     
 
            The 87-year-old pontiff has repeatedly called for peace in the Middle East and for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He has also called many times for the release of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
     
This post has been updated with additional comments from the Pope.
 
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reiterated US support for Israel’s right to defend itself and said the US is committed to preventing Iran and Iranian-backed partners from further escalating the conflict in Lebanon, during a call on Saturday with Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
     
            It was Austin’s third call in two days with his Israeli counterpart, following intensified Israeli strikes in Lebanon this week, which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday in Beirut.
     
            Austin also emphasized that the US “remains postured to defend U.S. forces in the region,” according to a readout from the Department of Defense.
     
            Israeli airstrikes in Gaza continued over the past 24 hours, with the Civil Defense Directorate reporting that eight people have been killed.
     
            Civil Defense Spokesman Mahmoud Basal said that residential buildings across the strip were struck, including in Gaza City in the north, the Nuseirat area of central Gaza, and the Al-Nasr neighborhood near the southern city of Rafah.
     
            On Saturday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said that the bodies of 52 people had been brought to hospitals in the previous 48 hours, with 118 people injured, as a result of Israeli military operations. The ministry said the cumulative death toll since October 7 has risen to 41,595.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not provided an update on current operations in Gaza on Sunday, but released details of what it said was a one-kilometer tunnel used by Hamas in central Gaza.
     
            It said troops had “discovered, mapped, and dismantled an underground tunnel route approximately one-kilometer long located in the center of the Gaza Strip, embedded near residential buildings and civilian spaces.”
     
            “Inside the tunnel, several rooms and equipment used by Hamas terrorists for prolonged stays were discovered,” the IDF said.
     
            The head of the biggest Christian community in Lebanon has condemned Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, saying that it opened “a wound in the heart of the Lebanese.”
     
            “The blood of the martyrs cries out to us to defend Lebanon against all aggression, and to elect a president of the republic who will restore Lebanon’s place among the nations,” the Patriarch of the Maronite Church, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, said at Sunday Mass.
     
            Lebanon has a complicated political system in which power is shared along sectarian lines among Christians and Sunni and Shia Muslims. By convention, the president is supposed to be a Maronite Christian but the position is vacant after parliament failed to agree multiple times on a candidate.
     
            In the past, al-Rahi has been one of the most prominent critics of Hezbollah within Lebanon. In January, he implicitly criticized Hezbollah for dragging the south of Lebanon into conflict with Israel due to its cross-border rocket and drone attacks.
     
            On Sunday, al-Rahi urged the international community “to work seriously to stop the cycle of war, killing and destruction in our country.”
     
            He also condemned “the culture of death that has brought nothing but imaginary victories and shameful defeats to our country.”
     
            Lebanon’s army has called on the Lebanese people “to preserve national unity” during what it described as a “dangerous and delicate stage in our country’s history.”
     
            In a strongly-worded statement released Sunday, the Army Command said that it urged its citizens “not to be drawn into actions that may affect civil peace” following the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the killing of more than 1,000 others.
     
            “The Israeli enemy is working to implement its destructive plans and spread division among the Lebanese,” it added.
     
            The Army Command said it was carrying out its “national duty to preserve civil peace and calls on citizens to respond to these measures and act in accordance with national unity.”
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has claimed Sunday that it killed Nabil Qaouk, the commander of Hezbollah’s Preventive Security Unit and a member of Hezbollah’s central council, in an airstrike Saturday. It gave no detail on where the strike took place.
     
            The IDF said that Qaouk was “considered to be close to the top of” Hezbollah and “was directly engaged in promoting terrorist designs against the State of Israel and its citizens, even in recent days.”
     
            Hezbollah has not yet commented on the IDF’s claims.
     
            The United States designated Qaouk a global terrorist in October 2020, saying he had represented Hezbollah at events commemorating deceased Hezbollah terrorists as well as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in a US drone strike in January 2020.
     
            Approximately eight projectiles have been launched from Lebanon into Israel on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
     
            The projectiles fell in open areas near the city of Tiberias, which is in the north of the country.
     
            Thousands of Israelis evacuated from communities close to the Lebanese border to Tiberias last year, swelling the city’s population by 20%.
     
            Exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have occurred consistently since October 8, the day after Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks.
     
            The situation has ramped up since last week, when Israel wounded thousands of people across Lebanon by detonating pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members, followed by a ferocious bombing campaign that has left hundreds dead.
     
            Israel’s military said Sunday morning it was continuing to strike Hezbollah targets and “terrorist infrastructure” in Lebanon – part of its ramped-up onslaught against the Iran-backed militant group.
     
            It has also raised the possibility of a ground incursion into Lebanon which, if undertaken, would be the fourth Israeli invasion of the country in the past 50 years.
     
            Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Lebanon in the recent escalation, while more than 1,000 have been killed since airstrikes escalated last week, according to Lebanese government officials.
     
Here’s what you need to know:
 
            Four people were killed and an unknown number of others wounded in an Israeli airstrike that targeted the town of Tayr Debba in southern Lebanon, Lebanese state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported early on Sunday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday morning it was continuing to strike Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including “launchers that were aimed toward Israeli territory, structures in which weapons were stored and additional Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure.”
     
            In a video shared along with the statement, the IDF said strikes were conducted on several areas in southern Lebanon, including Marjayoun, Deir Aames and Jouaiyya, as well as towns in the eastern Baalbek-Hermel and Bekaa regions.
     
            “Over the past day, the IDF struck hundreds of Hezbollah terror targets throughout Lebanon,” the IDF statement said, adding it continues to “operate to degrade and dismantle Hezbollah’s capabilities.”
     
            Lebanese state media reported Israeli warplanes targeted a civil defense center and conducted a series of airstrikes on the city of Hermel and its surroundings, in the Baalbek region.
     
            In Beirut, live pictures from Reuters news agency on Sunday morning showed smoke rising above the skyline. The capital has been struck by multiple Israeli airstrikes in recent days, including one that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            More than 1,000 people in Lebanon have been killed since Israeli attacks escalated last week, Lebanon’s health minister Dr. Firass Abiad said on Saturday.
     
            Hassan Nasrallah’s death marks a major moment in recent Middle East history, but the long-term consequences are uncertain. It raises a key question: Do “decapitation strikes” killing the leaders of terrorist groups cripple them? The short answer is not really.
     
            Israel should know from its own history that such strikes don’t always succeed in crippling a militant group. In 2008, Israel killed Hezbollah’s military leader, Imad Mughniyeh, in Damascus, Syria, yet the group only gathered strength in the years that followed.
     
            Four years earlier, Israel killed a founder of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in an airstrike. Yet, the group did not collapse, and almost two decades later it still carried out the October 7 attacks in Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis in a single day.
     
            The US has its own history of killing terrorist leaders in the hope that it will cripple its foes. When Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a US bombing raid in 2006, it was treated as a major breakthrough because al Qaeda in Iraq was significantly contributing to the civil war that was then tearing the country apart.
     
            Yet eight years later, al Qaeda in Iraq eventually morphed into ISIS, which took over territory the size of Portugal and presided over a population of some eight million people in Iraq and Syria.
     
            What actually ended ISIS’s geographical “caliphate” was not a strike on its leadership but a ground campaign against the terrorist army from 2014 to 2019 waged by the Iraqi military and Syrian Kurdish forces backed by thousands of US troops and significant American airpower.
     
            The killing of Nasrallah is a key prize for Israel as part of its larger wave of attacks on Hezbollah that intensified earlier this month with its covert action exploding thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies followed by massive airstrikes that have taken out infrastructure and other senior leaders.
     
            But it’s too early to write the militant group off, though it’s clearly in disarray. History suggests it will reorganize and appoint other leaders to continue its long fight against Israel.

            Hundreds of families have resorted to sleeping on beaches and in public squares in Beirut after seeking shelter following the Israeli military’s airstrikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs.
     
            Among those displaced were some who had fled to Lebanon to escape deadly conflict elsewhere.
     
            Syrian refugee Fatima Chahine told the Associated Press that she, her husband and their two children fled Dahiyeh – where Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed on Friday – on a motorbike in the night and went straight to the Ramlet al-Bayda public beach.
     
            There was “bombing below us and strikes above us,” she said.
     
            “We only want a place where our children won’t be afraid,” she said. “We fled from the war in Syria in 2011 because of the children and we came here, and now the same thing is happening again.”
     
            Talal Ahmad Jassaf, a Lebanese man who slept on the beach with his family, said they spent “more than three hours going in circles between schools and shelters and we didn’t find one with room.” He said he is considering going to the relative safety of Syria, but he worries about airstrikes on the journey.
     
            Families were also seen camped out overnight around the Martyrs’ Square plaza and sleeping on streets in downtown Beirut, scenes reminiscent of when Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel went to war in 2006.
     
            The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for residents of Dahiyeh, but left little time between the orders and the commencement of additional strikes.
     
            Nasser Yassine, head of the Lebanon Crisis Observatory, told CNN on Saturday that “more than 100,000 have been officially registered (as displaced), but many more – up to 250,000 – are estimated to be in formal and informal collective shelters.”
     
            The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both Israel and Lebanon. One of Israel’s stated war aims is to return tens of thousands of its own displaced civilians to northern Israel.
     
            The US sees the possibility of a limited ground incursion into Lebanon as Israel moves forces to its northern border, according to a senior administration official and a US official. But the officials stressed that Israel does not appear to have made a decision on whether to carry out a ground incursion.
     
            The US assessment was based on the mobilization of Israeli troops and the clearing of areas in what could be preparation for the launching of a ground incursion, one of the officials said.
     
            Earlier Saturday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner said the military was preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion, but it was only one option being considered. Israel’s stated goal is to return more than 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon.
     
            And on Wednesday, Israel’s top general, Herzi Halevi, said the country was preparing for the possible entry of ground forces into Lebanon.
     
            Shortly before news of the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a senior Israeli official said Israel hopes not to carry out a ground incursion into Lebanon.
     
        “Our preference is not to have a ground incursion,” the official said.
     
 
            Iran’s envoy to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to “condemn Israel’s actions in the strongest possible terms.”
     
            The letter comes after an Israeli attack in Beirut on Friday that killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and a key Iran ally.
     
            In a letter to the council’s president on Saturday, Iravani urged members of the Security Council to “take immediate and decisive action to stop Israel’s ongoing aggression” and prevent it from “pushing the entire region into an all-out catastrophe.”
     
            “On 27 September 2024, Israel perpetrated a flagrant act of terrorist aggression against residential areas in Beirut, using US-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters to assassinate Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader,” Iravani said, adding that “many innocent people” and an Iranian general were also killed in the attack.
     
        “For a year now, Israel has been committing genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in Gaza with complete impunity, while the UN Security Council has remained paralyzed due to the United States’ obstruction of an effective decision by that body,” Iravani said.
     
 
            Iravani also “strongly” warned against “any attack on [Iran’s] diplomatic premises and representatives in violation of the foundational principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.”
     
            “Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,” he added.
     
Some background: In April, Iran accused Israel of bombing its embassy complex in Syria. The airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, according to Iran’s Foreign Ministry.
     
            In response, Iran launched a brief but unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel. No one was killed in Israel by the attack.
     
            Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said there was now a “huge opportunity” for Israel to “remove this whole threat” of Hezbollah, and for the Middle East to reject it and other militant Iranian proxies.
     
        “Hezbollah right now is temporarily badly harmed and injured, but if we let go of them now, they’ll just recover and hit us back in two or three or five years, that’s something none of us want to do,” Bennett told CNN’s Jessica Dean, adding that this could be achieved with or without a ground incursion by Israel into Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.
     
 
            The former prime minister called on the people of Lebanon to “rise up” and “take back” their country.
     
            “Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, hijacked your nation 30 years ago, and it’s made everyone’s life miserable. Now is your time to kick them out – don’t let them come back,” he said.
     
            He also framed the current moment, in which Israel says it has weakened Hezbollah, as well as Hamas in Gaza, as an opportunity for Iranian proxies across the region to be “thrown away.”
     
        “The United States and Israel and the leading Western countries have to set an objective of toppling the Iranian regime in the near future,” he said, adding this could be achieved by sanctions, cyber activities, “overt and covert operations” and “empowering the Iranian people” to fight the regime.
     
 
            “For the first time in decades, this is actually possible. It’s achievable but we have to be determined about it,” he said, referring to eliminating Iranian proxies. “It’s time for the whole region to kick out the Iranian regime. It’s not going to happen tomorrow, but it can happen over the next few years,” he said.
     
Some context: The Israel Defense Forces have said the military is preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion into Lebanon, but it was only one option being considered as Israeli forces have ramped up strikes on Hezbollah targets in the country. Israel’s stated goal is to return more than 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon.
     
            Now that Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the coming days will likely see the group’s commanders assessing who is left, how safe it is to communicate and meet, and exactly what level of pain tolerance it retains as it tries to formulate a response.
     
            But while the world awaits Hezbollah’s — and Iran’s — next move, it is Israel’s next steps that matter most.
     
            The country has shown that it has the intelligence advantage, military might and tolerance for international condemnation of civilian casualties to continue to strike at will. But this risks turning a fortnight of brutal strikes into another longer-term loss to Israeli prestige.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a defining choice to make. Does the past fortnight salvage his domestic reputation for security and leave him better placed to face the music of the cases against him? Or does he again calculate that an ongoing war without clear strategic direction is his best way forward?
     
            Ultimately a wider field of vision must win out. Lebanon’s civilians — and its southern neighbors — need political accommodation and a ceasefire now, regardless of what it means for the fate of Israel’s current political elite.
     
Read Nick Paton Walsh’s full analysis here.
 
            The death of Hassan Nasrallah has caught President Joe Biden in a bind: While no one in the White House shed any tears for the longtime Hezbollah leader, the Israeli airstrike that took him out has only worsened fears of an escalating conflict, something Biden says he’s actively working to avoid.
     
            In the immediate aftermath of the operation, Biden was quick to alert the public that he hadn’t received any advance warning and wasn’t involved. It was only 24 hours later, after both Israel and Hezbollah had confirmed Nasrallah was killed, that Biden released a carefully worded statement declaring the death a “measure of justice” but repeating that his “aim is to de-escalate.”
     
            For Biden, the moment amounts to another high-tension balancing act — this time, only six weeks before a US presidential election. Already at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the nearly yearlong war in Gaza, the president is now working to calm two fronts at a moment when his influence on Netanyahu’s decision-making appears to be at an all-time low.
     
            Ahead of Friday’s strike, Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States and France that called for a 21-day pause in fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border, infuriating American officials who had been led to believe he was on board.
     
            Israel informed the US it was launching its major operation in Beirut only after it was underway — again, to the frustration of some American officials.
     
            In his initial remarks Friday, Biden repeated his fear — which has ebbed and flowed over the course of the past year, but is now at a high point — that a wider conflict could be on the horizon: “I’m always concerned about that,” he said.

            The Jordanian Armed Forces says a rocket launched from southern Lebanon landed in an uninhabited desert area of Muwaqqar, east of the capital Amman, on Saturday.
     
            Teams were dispatched to the site, but no casualties or material damage were reported, it said in a statement.
     
            Air defense systems were ready to intercept any projectiles or drones attempting to enter Jordanian airspace, it added.
     
            “The armed forces are continuing to protect the skies, land and borders of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan from any danger intended to destabilize its security and stability,” it said.
     
            The Israeli killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut has dramatically inflamed fears of a full-scale war in the Middle East — a possibility that US President Joe Biden’s administration has been desperately seeking for months to forestall, according to current and former US officials.
     
            “I don’t see how this doesn’t go much wider soon,” said one senior Western official.
     
            Hezbollah will almost certainly respond, according to Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region, and Iran is likely to play a role.
     
            “The response is likely to be big enough that the odds it will prompt a full-scale war will skyrocket,” Panikoff said.
     
            Hezbollah, which the US designates as a terrorist organization, is Iran’s most powerful and capable proxy militia in the region. There are some indications Tehran had already grown alarmed about the degree of damage Israel has been inflicting on the group, according to a US military official.
     
            A senior US official said the US believes Iran will intervene in the conflict if they judge that they are about to “lose” Hezbollah. The combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah had already taken hundreds of fighters off the battlefield, according to that official and another person familiar with the intelligence.
     
            US officials have long assessed that senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as fighting has intensified in recent months. The killing of Nasrallah is categorically different, however.
     
            Hezbollah’s rank-and-file have long been agitating to play a bigger role in the fighting with Israel since October 7, and it now risks losing legitimacy in the eyes of its fighters and supporters if it does not offer a maximalist response to the killing of its leader, according to Panikoff.
     
            The strike was also a clear signal of Israel’s willingness to risk a broader conflict, and that it was not close to accepting a ceasefire proposal backed by the US, according to Mick Mulroy, a former top Middle East official at the Defense Department. Hezbollah is also now unlikely to be interested in the negotiations.

• Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, after Israel said he was killed in its airstrikes on the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday. The killing marks a major escalation in the long-running conflict and deepens fears of a wider regional war.
     
• US officials see the possibility of a limited Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon, but they stress Israel does not appear to have made a decision yet whether to send troops across the border.
     
• The strikes that killed Nasrallah targeted a densely populated area and destroyed residential buildings. Israel has carried out more strikes Saturday on what it says are Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, killing at least 33 people and wounding 195, according to the country’s health ministry.
     
• An estimated 1 million people have been displaced by recent fighting in southern Lebanon, a government minister told CNN. One of Israel’s stated war aims is to return tens of thousands of its own civilians displaced by the cross-border fighting.
     
Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
 
            The US sees the possibility of a limited ground incursion into Lebanon as Israel moves forces to its northern border, according to a senior administration official and a US official. But the officials stressed that Israel does not appear to have made a decision on whether to carry out a ground incursion.
     
            The US assessment was based on the mobilization of Israeli troops and the clearing of areas in what could be preparation for the launching of a ground incursion, one of the officials said.
     
            Earlier Saturday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner said the military was preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion, but it was only one option being considered. Israel’s stated goal is to return more than 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon.
     
            And on Wednesday, Israel’s top general, Herzi Halevi, said the country was preparing for the possible entry of ground forces into Lebanon.
     
            Shortly before news of the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a senior Israeli official said Israel hopes not to carry out a ground incursion into Lebanon.
     
        “Our preference is not to have a ground incursion,” the official said.
     
 
            Iran’s envoy to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to “condemn Israel’s actions in the strongest possible terms.”
     
            The letter comes after an Israeli attack in Beirut on Friday that killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and a key Iran ally.
     
            In a letter to the council’s president on Saturday, Iravani urged members of the Security Council to “take immediate and decisive action to stop Israel’s ongoing aggression” and prevent it from “pushing the entire region into an all-out catastrophe.”
     
            “On 27 September 2024, Israel perpetrated a flagrant act of terrorist aggression against residential areas in Beirut, using US-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters to assassinate Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader,” Iravani said, adding that “many innocent people” and an Iranian general were also killed in the attack.
     
            “For a year now, Israel has been committing genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in Gaza with complete impunity, while the UN Security Council has remained paralyzed due to the United States’ obstruction of an effective decision by that body,” Iravani said.
     
            Iravani also “strongly” warned against “any attack on [Iran’s] diplomatic premises and representatives in violation of the foundational principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.”
     
        “Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,” he added.
     
 
Some background: In April, Iran accused Israel of bombing its embassy complex in Syria. The airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, according to Iran’s Foreign Ministry.
     
            In response, Iran launched a brief but unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel. No one was killed in Israel by the attack.
     
            Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said there was now a “huge opportunity” for Israel to “remove this whole threat” of Hezbollah, and for the Middle East to reject it and other militant Iranian proxies.
     
        “Hezbollah right now is temporarily badly harmed and injured, but if we let go of them now, they’ll just recover and hit us back in two or three or five years, that’s something none of us want to do,” Bennett told CNN’s Jessica Dean, adding that this could be achieved with or without a ground incursion by Israel into Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.
     
 
            The former prime minister called on the people of Lebanon to “rise up” and “take back” their country.
     
            “Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, hijacked your nation 30 years ago, and it’s made everyone’s life miserable. Now is your time to kick them out – don’t let them come back,” he said.
     
            He also framed the current moment, in which Israel says it has weakened Hezbollah, as well as Hamas in Gaza, as an opportunity for Iranian proxies across the region to be “thrown away.”
     
        “The United States and Israel and the leading Western countries have to set an objective of toppling the Iranian regime in the near future,” he said, adding this could be achieved by sanctions, cyber activities, “overt and covert operations” and “empowering the Iranian people” to fight the regime.
     
 
            “For the first time in decades, this is actually possible. It’s achievable but we have to be determined about it,” he said, referring to eliminating Iranian proxies. “It’s time for the whole region to kick out the Iranian regime. It’s not going to happen tomorrow, but it can happen over the next few years,” he said.
     
Some context: The Israel Defense Forces have said the military is preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion into Lebanon, but it was only one option being considered as Israeli forces have ramped up strikes on Hezbollah targets in the country. Israel’s stated goal is to return more than 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon.
     
            The Jordanian Armed Forces says a rocket launched from southern Lebanon landed in an uninhabited desert area of Muwaqqar, east of the capital Amman, on Saturday.
     
            Teams were dispatched to the site, but no casualties or material damage were reported, it said in a statement.
     
            Air defense systems were ready to intercept any projectiles or drones attempting to enter Jordanian airspace, it added.
     
            “The armed forces are continuing to protect the skies, land and borders of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan from any danger intended to destabilize its security and stability,” it said.
     
            The death of Hassan Nasrallah has caught President Joe Biden in a bind: While no one in the White House shed any tears for the longtime Hezbollah leader, the Israeli airstrike that took him out has only worsened fears of an escalating conflict, something Biden says he’s actively working to avoid.
     
            In the immediate aftermath of the operation, Biden was quick to alert the public that he hadn’t received any advance warning and wasn’t involved. It was only 24 hours later, after both Israel and Hezbollah had confirmed Nasrallah was killed, that Biden released a carefully worded statement declaring the death a “measure of justice” but repeating that his “aim is to de-escalate.”
     
            For Biden, the moment amounts to another high-tension balancing act — this time, only six weeks before a US presidential election. Already at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the nearly yearlong war in Gaza, the president is now working to calm two fronts at a moment when his influence on Netanyahu’s decision-making appears to be at an all-time low.
     
            Ahead of Friday’s strike, Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States and France that called for a 21-day pause in fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border, infuriating American officials who had been led to believe he was on board.
     
            Israel informed the US it was launching its major operation in Beirut only after it was underway — again, to the frustration of some American officials.
     
            In his initial remarks Friday, Biden repeated his fear — which has ebbed and flowed over the course of the past year, but is now at a high point — that a wider conflict could be on the horizon: “I’m always concerned about that,” he said.

            Around 1 million people have been displaced by Israeli attacks in Lebanon since Monday, according to the minister in charge of the country’s crisis management center.
     
        “More than 100,000 have been officially registered, but many more — up to 250,000 — are estimated to be in formal and informal collective shelters,” Nasser Yassin, head of the Lebanon Crisis Observatory, told CNN on Saturday.
     
 
            “We estimate four times as many have been directly affected and/or displaced outside the shelters,” Yassin, who serves as the country’s environment minister, added.
     
Some background: Residents on both sides of the Lebanon-Israel border have for months been impacted as Israel and Hezbollah exchange fire, but Lebanese officials say the number of displaced civilians has spiked dramatically during the current period of intensified Israeli bombardment.
     
            One of Israel’s stated war aims is to return tens of thousands of its own displaced civilians to northern Israel.
     
            President Joe Biden said the US is responding to a missile barrage from the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group in the Red Sea.
     
            When asked Saturday about the attacks, Biden told reporters, “We’re responding,” as he departed church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
     
            The US Navy intercepted Houthi missiles launched at three warships in the Red Sea. The barrage was launched from the Iranian-backed rebel group toward two guided-missile destroyers and a littoral combat ship as the US vessels traveled north through the Bab el-Mandeb strait, CNN previously reported.
     
            Biden also said Saturday that it is “time for a ceasefire” when asked if a ground incursion by Israeli forces into Lebanon was inevitable.
     
Remember: The Houthis, like Hezbollah and Hamas, are among the Iranian proxy groups aligned against Israel.
     
            Clashes involving the Iran-backed groups have increased since Hamas’ October 7 attacks and the ensuing Israeli military offensive in Gaza, with the Houthis saying their attacks on vessels in key shipping lanes are made in solidarity with the Palestinians.
     
            The killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah this week has marked another major escalation in the Middle East and deepened fears of a wider regional war involving Iran and the various militant groups.
     
            At least 33 people have been killed and 195 injured by Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Saturday, according to the country’s health ministry.
     
            Israel has pounded what it says are Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese capital of Beirut and elsewhere in the country on Friday and Saturday, including an attack in the capital’s southern suburbs that killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Some of the strikes have come in densely populated areas, flattening residential buildings.
     
            Israel has said Hezbollah stores weapons in civilian buildings, which the group denies, and accuses Hezbollah of using residents as “human shields.”
     
            Lebanese civilians say they cannot heed warnings from Israel’s military to avoid places where Hezbollah is operating, because the group is a highly secretive organization. The health ministry says over 1,000 people have been killed since Israeli attacks escalated last week.
     
CNN’s Hamdi Alkhshali contributed reporting to this post.
 
            The Israel Defense Forces says a projectile launched from Lebanon has landed in the West Bank.
     
            The projectile fell in the Mitzpe Hagit area of the occupied territory, according to the IDF. The military said fire and rescue services were working to extinguish fires.
     
            The Israeli emergency service Magen David Adom said it sent teams to three locations and there were no casualties so far.
     
            Sirens had sounded in the West Bank earlier tonight, soon after Hezbollah said it launched long-range missiles from Lebanon toward the Jerusalem area.
     
Remember: The West Bank is a territory that lies between Israel and Jordan, home to 3.3 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation. It is also home to more than 700,000 Jewish Israeli settlers, whose presence is considered illegal under international law.
     
            Hezbollah said Saturday it launched long-range missiles from Lebanon toward the Jerusalem area.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces confirmed sirens had sounded in Jerusalem following the launch.
     
        “A short while ago, sirens were sounded in the area of Jerusalem following a launch from Lebanon toward Israeli territory,” the IDF said.
     
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made his first public comments after an Israeli airstrike killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, in Beirut on Friday.
     
            Speaking from Israel Defense Forces headquarters in Tel Aviv on Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel’s assassination of the Hezbollah leader “settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of Frenchmen.”
     
            Netanyahu called Nasrallah’s killing “a necessary condition for achieving the goals we have set.”
     
            The Israeli prime minister was referring to tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced by cross-border fire in the north of the country. Last week, Israel made returning residents to their homes in the north an explicit war aim.
     
        “As long as Nasrallah lives, he would quickly restore the capabilities we took away from Hezbollah,” Netanyahu said.
     
 
            “That’s why I gave the directive — and Nasrallah is no longer with us,” he added.
     
            Netanyahu made no reference to a US-led ceasefire proposal for the Israel-Lebanon border in his remarks, which come just a day after he made a combative speech at the United Nations General Assembly, vowing to continue the fight with Hezbollah — and swiping directly at Iran.
     
            “I say to the Ayatollah’s regime: whoever beat us, we will beat them,” he said.
     
        “There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach, and today you already know how true this is,” Netanyahu added.
     
 
            The prime minister said that Israel had arrived at a “historic turning point.”
     
            “We are determined to continue to strike at our enemies, return our residents to their homes, and return all our abductees. We do not forget them for a moment,” he said.
     
            US President Joe Biden held a call on Saturday with Vice President Kamala Harris and his national security team on the developments in the Middle East, according to the White House.
     
        “President Biden convened a call with Vice President Harris and their national security team to receive an update on the situation in the Middle East, review the status of US military force posture in the region, and direct continued diplomatic efforts to coordinate with allies and partners and deescalate the ongoing conflicts. The President and Vice President will continue to receive regular updates,” the White House said.
     
 
            The president said in a statement earlier on Saturday that he had directed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war.”
     
            Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi criticized Israel for what he said was a “catastrophic” military escalation against Lebanon.
     
        “We hold Israel fully responsible for the catastrophic consequences of its aggression on Lebanon, which it is launching brutally without any legal or humanitarian deterrent, while it continues its aggression on Gaza and its dangerous escalation in the West Bank,” Safadi said on X.
     
 
            Safadi denounced Israel’s actions as a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and said the bombing of its capital and the loss of civilian lives threatened the country’s stability.
     
            He also expressed Jordan’s solidarity with the Lebanese people.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces is preparing for possible ground operations in Lebanon, but will carry them out only if required, a spokesperson told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.
     
            IDF spokesperson Peter Lerner on Saturday said IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi spoke with reserve forces earlier this week about that option.
     
            But the primary goal of the Israeli military with regard to Hezbollah is to restore safety and security in northern Israel so that the 60,000 Israelis who have evacuated the area can return home, Lerner said.
     
            Regarding the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Lerner said the IDF had targeted him because “he was building such a huge arsenal of weapons” including 200,000 rockets, missiles and drones for the sole purpose of going “to war with Israel.”
     
            He said Israel had been conducting extensive intelligence surveillance since 2006 to understand Hezbollah.
     
            Lerner added that Israel conducted airstrikes both before and after Nasrallah’s death that had eliminated a senior intelligence official and strategic assets belonging to Hezbollah.
     
            Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati declared three days of mourning starting Monday following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
        “Following the martyrdom of Hezbollah secretary-general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who joined the caravan of martyrs who fell as a result of the sinful Israeli aggression on Lebanon, official mourning is declared on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday – September 30 and October 1 and 2,” Mikati said.
     
 
            During the mourning period, flags will be flown at half-staff across all official departments, public institutions and municipalities. Radio and television programming will be adjusted.
     
            Mikati added that on the day of Nasrallah’s funeral, work would be paused in all public administrations, municipalities, and public and private institutions. He did not specify which day the funeral would be held.
     
            Hezbollah confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah after Israel said he was killed in an airstrike in Beirut on Friday.
     
            The Iran-backed militant group vowed to keep up “its fight to confront the enemy” in a statement Saturday.
     
            Israel has continued to strike what it says are Hezbollah targets in Lebanon throughout the day.
     
Here’s what you need to know:
 
            The Israel Defense Forces is warning residents in southern Lebanon, the country’s Beqaa region and the southern suburbs of its capital, Beirut, to stay away from Hezbollah facilities.
     
        “If you are near Hezbollah property, combat equipment, interests or any other facility belonging to it, (then for) your safety and the safety of your families, we appeal to you to stay away from the area and not return until further notice,” the military’s Arabic language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said in a social media post.
     
 
            The warning has been criticized by many Lebanese people, who say they cannot know the whereabouts of Hezbollah’s facilities because the group is a highly secretive organization.
     
            An intensified round of Israeli strikes Friday and Saturday on the densely populated suburbs of Beirut has flattened residential buildings. Lebanese officials say over 1,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since last week.
     
            Israel claims recent strikes in Beirut have targeted buildings storing weapons, which Hezbollah denies, and has accused the militant group of using civilians as “human shields.”
     
            US Vice President Kamala Harris called Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s death a “measure of justice” for his victims, echoing the statement that President Joe Biden released earlier Saturday.
     
        “Hassan Nasrallah was a terrorist with American blood on his hands. Across decades, his leadership of Hezbollah destabilized the Middle East and led to the killing of countless innocent people in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and around the world. Today, Hezbollah’s victims have a measure of justice,” Harris said in a statement released by her office.
     
 
            The vice president is monitoring the situation in the Middle East with her team in California and receiving briefings, as she remains on the West Coast of the US for political events.
     
            Harris, like Biden, also called for de-escalation in the region in her statement, saying in part that she does “not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war.”
     
            “We have been working on a diplomatic solution along the Israel-Lebanon border so that people can safely return home on both sides of that border. Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region,” she added, echoing the president’s statement.
     
Some context: As the Democratic nominee for US president, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East have served as a significant foreign policy test for Harris, with observers at home and globally watching closely for indications of how her potential administration would approach Israel.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared five days of national mourning following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and warned that Israel faces “crushing blows” to come.
     
            In a statement Saturday, Khamenei extended his sympathies to Nasrallah’s family, the “resistance front,” the Lebanese people and the wider Islamic community.
     
            Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on Friday.
     
        “The Islamic world lost a great personality, the resistance front lost a prominent standard-bearer, and Hezbollah lost an unparalleled leader,” Khamenei said.
     
 
            In a warning to Israel, he added: “The blows of the resistance front against the weary and decaying body of the Zionist regime will, with the help of God, be more crushing.”
     
Remember: Nasrallah was one of the founders of Hezbollah, which formed four decades ago and has become the most powerful Iranian proxy in its axis of aligned militant groups spread across Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq.
     
            Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. In Lebanon, Hezbollah is considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, and Nasrallah was revered by a loyal base of followers as a religious and political leader.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces says a senior Hezbollah intelligence leader, Hassan Khalil Yassin, was killed in one of its airstrikes on the Dahiyeh area of Beirut.
     
            The IDF said Yassin worked with Hezbollah’s offensive units to personally plan terror attacks against Israeli civilians on the northern border and deep within Israeli territory.
     
            Hezbollah has not publicly commented on the Israeli claim.
     
            The US State Department on Saturday allowed certain employees and their family members and ordered other family members to depart Lebanon as the conflict threatens to deepen following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            The authorized and ordered departure of non-emergency personnel and family members is not an evacuation of the entire embassy, but it does reflect the increased volatility in the country and its capital of Beirut.
     
        “On September 28 the Department of State ordered the departure of non-mission-employed EFMs and authorized departure for mission-employed EFMs (eligible family members) and non-essential USDH (US direct hire) employees due to the volatile and unpredictable security situation in Beirut,” the State Department said in an updated travel advisory.
     
 
            “U.S. Embassy Beirut personnel are restricted from personal travel without advance permission,” it said, noting that additional travel restrictions could be imposed “with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.”
     
            The department said commercial flights are still available “at reduced capacity,” but noted that those options could become unavailable should the security situation become worse.
     
            Earlier Saturday, the State Department launched a form for US citizens in Lebanon who are interested in assistance departing the country.
     
CORRECTION: This post has been corrected to reflect that there was an ordered and authorized departure notice.
 
            Iranian flag carrier Iran Air has announced the suspension of all flights to the Lebanese capital of Beirut, due to ongoing “aggression by the Israeli regime,” the country’s state news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
     
            The decision follows the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a massive Israeli airstrike on Beirut’s densely populated Dahiyeh neighborhood on Friday, which reduced several residential buildings to rubble.
     
            Israel is carrying out more strikes Saturday on what it says are Hezbollah targets in Beirut, as Lebanese officials report over 1,000 people killed since last week.
     
            US President Joe Biden said the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is a “measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, while calling for de-escalation in conflicts across the Middle East.
     
            In a statement, Biden said the US “fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups.”
     
        “Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means,” the president said. “In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon.”
     
 
            “It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,” he continued.
     
            UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Saturday that he is deeply alarmed by the significant escalation of events in Beirut over the past 24 hours.
     
        “This cycle of violence must stop now, and all sides must step back from the brink. The people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, as well as the wider region, cannot afford an all-out war,” Guterres said, according to his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.
     
 
            He also reiterated his call for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza and the unconditional release of all hostages, according to his spokesperson.
     
Remember: While Israel and Hezbollah have been locked in conflict for decades, the killing of the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has marked a major escalation and deepened fears of a wider regional war.
     
            Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has extended his condolences to Lebanon and Hezbollah over the death of the militant group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            He also gave his “heartfelt sympathies” to the Lebanese government for any civilian casualties that may result from conflict with Israel, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.
     
Remember: Hezbollah confirmed the death of Nasrallah after Israel said he was killed in its airstrikes on the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday, which flattened several buildings in a densely populated suburb. Israel has continued to pound the capital with further strikes on what it says are Hezbollah targets.
     
Some background: Nasrallah was one of the founders of Hezbollah, which formed four decades ago with the aid of Iran, and oversaw its transformation into one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. He was revered by some in Lebanon as a religious and political leader.
     
            Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, largely since Argentina blamed the group for the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29 people, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, which killed 85. Senior US officials welcomed the news of Nasrallah’s killing Saturday.
     
            In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. The group has characterized its most recent fighting with Israel as being in solidarity with Hamas and the Palestinians in Gaza.
     
            Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis declared three days of public mourning in the country following the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            The news was announced by Mahdi al-Mashat, the head of the Houthis’ supreme political council.
     
More background: Like Hezbollah, the Houthis are part of a network of militia groups across the Middle East headed by Iran.
     
            The Houthis were re-designated earlier this year by the US as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity amid continued attacks by the Yemen-based militia. The designation is aimed at deterring the Houthis from their ongoing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
     
            Earlier Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces said a missile launched toward Israel from Yemen was intercepted before it reached the country.
     
            Another huge explosion has hit the Lebanese capital of Beirut, a CNN team reports.
     
            Smoke can be seen rising from the city’s southern suburbs, where Israel has carried out a series of strikes recently.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said it had carried out a “precise” strike in the southern Dahiyeh neighborhood. The IDF said more details would follow.
     
Remember: An Israeli attack killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in the same area on Friday, according to the group. Israel continued pounding southern Beirut overnight into Saturday, claiming it was striking buildings storing weapons for the militant group.
     
            The southern suburbs are densely populated, and the Lebanese health ministry said early Saturday local time that at least six people were killed and more were wounded in the strikes that killed Nasrallah.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the United States is determined to protect Israel against Iran and its proxy groups, expressing “full support” for Israel’s right to defend itself, during two calls with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Friday.
     
            According to a statement, the two spoke after ramped-up Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon this week, which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Austin said the United States is committed to the defense of Israel and will remain in the region to protect US forces and facilities. Austin also reiterated the US will prevent Iran and other Iranian-backed partners or their proxies from exploiting the situation in Lebanon or expanding the conflict.
     
            The number of people killed in Lebanon since Israeli attacks escalated last week has reached at least 1,030, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            The death toll includes 56 women and 87 children, according to an update from the ministry on Saturday. A total of 6,352 people have been hurt in the Israeli strikes on the country, it said.
     
            Israel’s heavy strikes on parts of Lebanon last night killed at least 11 people and injured 108, according to the health ministry’s figures. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was among those killed in the capital of Beirut, the group announced earlier today.
     
        “It should be noted that there are still martyrs under the rubble, missing persons, and scattered remains,” the country’s minister of health, Dr. Firass Abiad, said in the report.
     
 
            Two of the recent Israeli strikes hit medical centers in southern Lebanon, killing seven people and injuring four others, he added.
     
            The majority of deaths in the most recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have come in the last week.
     
What Israel has said: The Israel Defense Forces says it is targeting Hezbollah infrastructure and weapons storage in the southern suburbs of Beirut, and has called on residents to evacuate their homes. It has accused Hezbollah of embedding in civilian areas and using residents as “human shields.”
 
            Families from heavily populated Beirut neighborhoods were seen fleeing with their belongings following the latest Israeli warning Friday, joining the tens of thousands of people who the Lebanese government says are internally displaced due to the fighting.
     
            A missile launched toward Israel from Yemen was intercepted before it reached the country, the Israel Defense Forces said Saturday.
     
            Sirens were sounded in central Israel to warn people, the IDF said.
     
Some background: The Yemen-based Houthi rebel group has regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country’s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses.
     
            The rebel group, which is aligned with Iran and has targeted Israel in the past, has not commented on Saturday’s missile launch.
     
            The Israeli government will not allow gatherings of more than 1,000 people in Tel Aviv, the nearby city of Netanya, and several other areas of Israel, according to guidelines published on Saturday.
     
            The rules are in effect until Monday at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET). This comes after Hezbollah said that it had launched a “rocket barrage” targeting several locations in Israel on Saturday.
     
            Israel also intercepted a missile fired by Hezbollah near Tel Aviv on Wednesday.
     
            More stringent restrictions on civilian life have long been implemented for Israelis near the country’s borders with Lebanon and Gaza.
     
            The US State Department has launched a form for US citizens in Lebanon to fill out if they are interested in getting assistance to depart the country as Israel’s military campaign continues to escalate.
     
            The form is not announcing an evacuation or US-assisted departures from the country yet, but it is a notable development that signals such options are likely on the horizon.
     
            The department has used similar forms in the past, such as in Israel after October 7 last year.
     
            CNN has reached out to the State Department for additional information.
     
            The form notes that the US is “able to assist only U.S. citizens and their accompanying immediate family (including spouses, children under 21-years old, and parents) who have valid travel documents for onward travel from Turkey or Cyprus.”
     
        “We continue to advise that U.S. citizens depart Lebanon due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hizballah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut,” the announcement said.
     
 
            “Travel within Lebanon is conducted at your own risk. The U.S. government cannot guarantee your safety traveling to airports, borders, or during any onward travel,” it continued.
     
            “Only attempt to depart Lebanon or travel within Lebanon if you believe it is safe for you to do so. The U.S. Embassy may not be able to assist U.S. citizens who choose to remain,” it added.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has landed back in Israel, his office said on Saturday, returning from the United States a day earlier than originally planned.
     
            Netanyahu was in New York on Friday, where he made a speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
     
            He took off from New York last night, after Israel launched a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            Some senior US officials celebrated the news of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s death in a major Israeli airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon — even despite growing concerns about the possibility of another full-scale war breaking out in the Middle East.
     
        “It’s welcome,” one senior US administration official told CNN after both the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death. “He has massive American blood on his hands.”
     
 
            President Joe Biden and the White House have yet to comment on the news of Nasrallah’s death, and the US has not said whether its own intelligence confirms his killing. The US and much of the Western world designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.
     
            “Nobody here is mourning Nasrallah,” another senior administration official told CNN, referring to the Hezbollah leader as a “terrorist” and “killer.”
     
            As of Saturday morning, it was simply too early to know what implications his death would have in the region and on the looming possibility of a major escalation, that official said.
     
            The US’ posture for now is to be prepared for a range of possible retaliation — but whether that would come from Hezbollah, Iran or both, was unknowable for now, they said.
     
            Had the events of the past few days taken place six months ago, the risk of a second major war might have been even greater, a senior US administration official said. But Hezbollah and Iran — which backs the militant group — have been weakened, the official added.
     
            Another senior US official previously told CNN that the US believes Iran will intervene in the conflict if they determine that they are about to “lose” Hezbollah, its most powerful proxy group.
     
            The US has been leading an effort on a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border. Those talks now appear entirely up in the air.
     
This post has been updated with comments from additional US officials.
 
            A senior commander in Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Abbas Nilforoushan, was among those killed in the Israeli strike targeting Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, Iranian state media said.
     
            Nilforoushan was the deputy commander for operations of the IRGC and was responsible for one of the security organizations directly in charge of protest suppression, the US Department of Treasury said.
     
            An experienced commander who served as a military adviser during the Syrian civil war, he was likely meeting Nasrallah in Beirut’s southern suburbs when Israel struck on Friday.
     
            The commander was sanctioned by the US Treasury for his role in suppressing protests during the 2022 Iranian demonstrations over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in custody of Iran’s morality police.
     
Remember: Nasrallah, along with other Hezbollah commanders, was killed in a huge Israeli strike on the Dahiyeh neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs yesterday.
     
            Several buildings were destroyed in Dahiyeh as Israel fired several airstrikes on the densely populated capital on Friday. At least six people were killed and dozens were wounded, with rescuers saying that they were still searching for more victims early Saturday local time.
     
            Now that Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the next 72 hours will likely see the group’s commanders assessing who is left, how safe it is to communicate and meet, and exactly what level of pain tolerance it retains as it tries to formulate a response.
     
            But while the world awaits Hezbollah’s — and Iran’s — next move, it is Israel’s next steps that matter most.
     
            The country has shown that it has the intelligence advantage, military might and tolerance for international condemnation of civilian casualties to continue to strike at will. But this risks turning a fortnight of brutal strikes into another longer-term loss to Israeli prestige.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a defining choice to make. Does the past fortnight salvage his domestic reputation for security and leave him better placed to face the music of the cases against him? Or does he again calculate that an ongoing war without clear strategic direction is his best way forward?
     
            Ultimately a wider field of vision must win out. Lebanon’s civilians — and its southern neighbors — need political accommodation and a ceasefire now, regardless of what it means for the fate of Israel’s current political elite.
     
Read Nick Paton Walsh’s full analysis here. 
 
            Gunfire erupted in Beirut after Hezbollah announced the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah — a gesture to mark martyrdom, believed by Muslims to be one of the highest honors in Islam.
     
            Many Hezbollah supporters were initially skeptical after Israel announced Nasrallah’s death earlier.
     
            Moments before Hezbollah announced Nasrallah’s death, a woman and a man told CNN they expected the group’s leader to “surprise us all with an appearance.”
     
            “He’s not in Lebanon. I know in my heart he isn’t,” said one elderly Shia woman in a black chador, smiling.
     
            Less than five minutes later, the announcement of his death came. “He was martyred,” she kept repeating as she pressed her face against a wall, fumbling to keep herself standing.
     
        “This is the biggest crisis of all,” she said.
     
 
            A man trying to console her said that “martyrdom was what he wanted … and it’s what he received.”
     
            Another woman broke down crying as she recited verses from the Quran with tears streaming down her face.
     
            In the Dahiyeh neighborhood of southern Beirut, where Nasrallah was killed by Israel, loud chants of: “We submit to you, Nasrallah,” and “We will never accept humiliation,” were heard.
     
            After Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s death, it’s not entirely clear who’s next in line to succeed him as the militant group’s chief, particularly because Israel has killed several levels of its hierarchy.
     
            CNN’s Ben Wedeman says there are two possibilities: Nasrallah’s deputy Naim Qassem or senior official Hashem Safieddine.
     
            “But at this point, given the body blows that Hezbollah has received going back to July 30, when Fu’ad Shukr was killed in the southern suburbs of Beirut in an Israeli drone strike, what we’re seeing is that the organization is clearly reeling at the moment. And perhaps their priority at the moment is surviving — those who are still alive — surviving to carry on to fight another day,” Wedeman says.
     
Watch Wedeman’s report from Beirut here:
 
            The Israeli killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut has dramatically inflamed fears of a full-scale war in the Middle East — a possibility that US President Joe Biden’s administration has been desperately seeking for months to forestall, according to current and former US officials.
     
        “I don’t see how this doesn’t go much wider soon,” said one senior Western official.
     
 
            Hezbollah will almost certainly respond, according to Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region, and Iran is likely to play a role.
     
            “The response is likely to be big enough that the odds it will prompt a full-scale war will skyrocket,” Panikoff said.
     
            Hezbollah, which the US designates as a terrorist organization, is Iran’s most powerful and capable proxy militia in the region. There are some indications Tehran had already grown alarmed about the degree of damage Israel has been inflicting on the group, according to a US military official.
     
            A senior US official said the US believes Iran will intervene in the conflict if they judge that they are about to “lose” Hezbollah. The combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah had already taken hundreds of fighters off the battlefield, according to that official and another person familiar with the intelligence.
     
            US officials have long assessed that senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as fighting has intensified in recent months. The killing of Nasrallah is categorically different, however.
     
            Hezbollah’s rank-and-file have long been agitating to play a bigger role in the fighting with Israel since October 7, and it now risks losing legitimacy in the eyes of its fighters and supporters if it does not offer a maximalist response to the killing of its leader, according to Panikoff.
     
            The strike was also a clear signal of Israel’s willingness to risk a broader conflict, and that it was not close to accepting a ceasefire proposal backed by the US, according to Mick Mulroy, a former top Middle East official at the Defense Department. Hezbollah is also now unlikely to be interested in the negotiations.
     
            Hamas issued a statement expressing condolences and solidarity with Hezbollah for the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and a number of senior officials from the group.
     
            The militant group condemned Nasrallah’s assassination as a “cowardly aggression,” describing the Israeli airstrike that killed him and his associates as a “heinous crime,” and praising Nasrallah’s longstanding support for Palestinians.
     
Remember: Israel and Hezbollah have been in conflict for decades, but the fighting across the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified since Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel and the ensuing Israeli military offensive in Gaza. Hezbollah has said recent clashes with Israel are in solidarity with Hamas and the Palestinians killed by Israeli bombardment.
     
            Hezbollah and Hamas are part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq.
     
More allies share condolences: Islamic Jihad in Palestine (PIJ) echoed Hamas’ sentiments, mourning the loss of a “giant Arab and Islamic figure who paved the path of victory for the nation.” They declared that his death would further “strengthen the resistance in Lebanon, Palestine, and the region.” The group hailed Nasrallah’s legacy, comparing his sacrifices to those of former Hezbollah leader Abbas Musawi.
     
            Powerful Iraqi cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr announced three days of mourning in Iraq, referring to Nasrallah as a “companion in the path of resistance and defiance” in a statement on Saturday.
     
            And Iraq’s most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, expressed his “deep sorrow” over the killing of Nasrallah in a statement. He called Israel’s targeting of the top Hezbollah figure on Friday a “horrific massacre” and praised Nasrallah’s role in what he described as the liberation of Lebanese territories from Israeli occupation, his support of Iraq in its fight against ISIS, and his dedication to the Palestinian cause.
     
CNN’s Hamdi Alkhshali contributed reporting. 
 
This post has been updated with additional reaction. 
 
            For months, Israeli officials have anticipated that Hezbollah would fire thousands of rockets and missiles toward Israel in the opening days of a major escalation in the long-running conflict between the two sides.
     
            Israel’s Iron Dome system would be overwhelmed. Israel’s major airport could be severely damaged. And hundreds of thousands could be left without power.
     
            But as Israel escalated the conflict over the last 11 days, beginning with the explosion of thousands of Hezbollah pagers and culminating in the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, none of that has come to pass.
     
            Hezbollah has fired several hundred rockets per day in response, but it has come nowhere close to delivering that type of major retaliation Israeli officials had been anticipating — at least not yet.
     
Why no large-scale response? Israeli officials believe that an overwhelming Hezbollah response has not materialized for two key reasons: Nearly all of Hezbollah’s senior commanders have been killed, leaving its command-and-control structure in disarray; and Israeli airstrikes have debilitated much of the operational infrastructure Hezbollah would use to carry out significant retaliation.
     
            Israeli officials said Hezbollah’s command structure has been decimated and its organization is in disarray. And a round of 1,600 airstrikes on Monday — followed by additional strikes in recent days — have struck weapons depots and missile launch positions that could have been used to carry out large-scale, simultaneous attacks.
     
            Still, Israeli officials are well-aware that Hezbollah can and likely will regroup. One Israeli official acknowledged that Israel knows it has not taken out Hezbollah’s entire capabilities and that its senior commanders are replaceable.
     
            Israel has taken advantage of what it believes to be internal chaos within Hezbollah over the last 24 hours, carrying out dozens of airstrikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where the group has a significant presence.
     
            The question now is what comes next: Israeli generals have said they are preparing for a ground offensive into Lebanon, but whether one unfolds has yet to be decided.
     
            And how Hezbollah regroups and what direction it receives from Iran also remain to be seen.
     
            Hezbollah has vowed that it will “continue its fight to confront the enemy” in a statement Saturday, after it confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut.
     
            The group described Nasrallah as a “sacred martyr” who led the group since 1992, saying that he was killed in a “treacherous Zionist airstrike on the southern suburbs” of the Lebanese capital. Israel said Saturday morning that it killed Nasrallah in an airstrike in southern Beirut on Friday.
     
        “The leadership of Hezbollah pledges to the most supreme, sacred, and dearest martyr in our journey, filled with sacrifices and martyrs, that it will continue its fight to confront the enemy, in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defense of Lebanon and its steadfast and honorable people,” the statement said.
     
 
            “His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary-General of Hezbollah, has joined his great and eternal martyred companions, whom he led for nearly thirty years, guiding them from victory to victory,” it continued.
     
            The Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar TV channel switched to Quranic recitations, an Islamic gesture declaring mourning.
     
            Hamas also issued a statement mourning Nasrallah.
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, after Israel said he was killed in an airstrike in Beirut on Friday.
     
            The group said Nasrallah was killed after a “treacherous Zionist airstrike on the southern suburbs.”
     
            The Israeli military has claimed that it killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in Friday’s huge airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon.
     
            There has been no confirmation from the Iran-backed militant group, but if he has died it is a major blow to Hezbollah, which has already been hit by a series of attacks from Israel.
     
Here’s what you need to know: 
 
            The Israeli military carried out fresh airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, it said on Saturday, as it continued to pound the Lebanese capital following Friday’s strike that killed Hezbollah’s leader.
     
            A CNN team saw smoke rising from a neighborhood, and videos geolocated by CNN to southern Beirut also showed smoke rising from buildings in the area.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces has struck 140 Hezbollah targets since Friday night, it said in a statement Saturday, reportedly destroying rocket launchers, weapons storage facilities and weapons production sites, some of which it said were “embedded underneath” residential buildings in Beirut.
     
            The IDF added that military operations to “degrade and dismantle Hezbollah’s military capabilities” are ongoing.
     
            Residents fled the southern Beirut neighborhood of Dahiyeh overnight Friday after the Israeli military warned of incoming strikes. Videos showed traffic jams and people fleeing the area with their belongings.
     
            Israel said six buildings in the neighborhood were targeted for storing anti-ship missiles. Hezbollah has previously denied storing weapons in the neighborhood.
     
            While Nasrallah’s targeting is unlikely to disrupt the operational continuity of the movement it is “obviously a massive, massive demoralization amongst its ranks and supporters and absolute terror which will temporarily paralyze ordinary people” within the movement, said Amal Saad, a Hezbollah expert and lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University in Wales.
     
            “That doesn’t mean the organization is paralyzed,” she added. “Hezbollah is an organization that was built to absorb these types of shocks… it’s built to be resilient and outlast individual leaders.”
     
            Few contenders for Hezbollah’s leadership can match Nasrallah’s popularity, said Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and author of “Hezbollahland,” as he is closely associated with the group’s “golden days,” including the end of Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 and the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, both of which were viewed as major victories for the Lebanese group.
     
            If the group’s leadership is truly dismantled and coordination between Iran and Hezbollah is disrupted, it could prompt Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to take the lead, according to Ghaddar.
     
            “They (Iran) will have to find a way to do it themselves. But it’s not an easy option as they will (become) targets, and they don’t understand Lebanon.”
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent a message of assurance to Hezbollah on Saturday, saying that “all regional resistance forces” are standing with the group.
     
            In his first message since the Israeli military claimed the killing of Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, Khamenei said that Israel was “too small to cause significant damage” to the Lebanese group. The fate of the region, he said, “will be determined by the resistance forces, at the top of which is a victorious Hezbollah.”
     
            “It is obligatory for all Muslims to stand proudly with the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah with their resources and help it in confronting the usurping, cruel and evil regime,” the written statement said.
     
            Hezbollah hasn’t yet commented on the claim that Nasrallah was killed. Khamenei did not mention the leader in the statement.
     
            Hezbollah has launched a “rocket barrage” targeting several locations in Israel, it announced on Saturday, following Israel’s claim that it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on Friday.
     
            Hezbollah hasn’t confirmed Nasrallah’s death.
     
            The Iran-backed group said it launched a rocket barrage and artillery targeting Rosh Pina, Sa’ar and Avivim in northern Israel.
     
            Rocket sirens were activated in Safed and the Upper Galilee, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces said a rocket was intercepted over the West Bank.
     
            No injuries were announced following the Hezbollah strikes.
     
            Israel’s Hostages Families Forum called for renewed efforts to free the remaining hostages held in Gaza on Saturday, following the Israeli military’s claim that it had killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            “And now, to the most important mission, after a year’s delay: returning all the hostages home,” the organization wrote in a post on X.
     
            As escalating attacks between Israel and Hezbollah over the past week have dominated news coverage and political attention, the families of the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza have expressed dismay that government’s efforts to secure the release of their loved ones is being overshadowed.
     
            The number of Israeli captives still in the enclave stands at 101, including 35 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office.
     
            The Israeli military says that it knows Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is dead based on a “combination of types of information,” an Israeli official said Saturday.
     
            The official would not go into any further specifics. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed on Saturday that it killed Nasrallah in an airstrike on Beirut on Friday. Hezbollah has not yet commented.
     
            “In this case we have confirmation, and I’m sharing it with you this morning,” the official said.
     
            “And I apologize, but I can’t go into the specifics of what intelligence, how we got to it – a combination of types of information we have. But I can tell you that the IDF has confirmed that Hassan Nasrallah is no longer with us.”
     
            The Israeli military has claimed that the group’s chain of command “has been almost completely dismantled” after it killed a series of what it says are top officials in the organization this week.
     
            The chain of command is not publicly known, however, and CNN cannot independently verify Israel’s claims.
     
            “Hezbollah has taken the biggest blow to its military infrastructure since its inception. In addition to losing weapon depots and facilities, the group has lost most of its senior commanders, and its communications network is broken,” said Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and author of “Hezbollahland.”
     
            Despite its losses however, the group still retains skilled commanders and many of its most powerful assets, including precision-guided missiles and long-range missiles that could inflict significant damage to Israel’s military and civilian infrastructure, said Ghaddar. Most of those missiles haven’t been deployed yet.
     
            Since Israel stepped up its campaign, Hezbollah’s military performance “has proven that it was able to absorb that shock and was able to bounce back and it has been striking hard at northern Israel for days now,” said Amal Saad, Hezbollah expert and lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University in Wales.
     
            On Wednesday, Israel intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Hezbollah near Tel Aviv, an unprecedented attack that reached deep into the country’s commercial heartland. Hezbollah said it targeted the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence agency.
     
            Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, congratulated the military on Saturday for a strike the previous day which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says killed Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            “I congratulate the defense establishment, the IDF and the IAF (Israeli Air Force) for the elimination of the mass murderer Hassan Nasrallah. All our enemies should know that those who attack Israel - is marked for death. This is a significant achievement for Israel’s deterrence and security,” Lapid wrote in a statement on X.
     
            The Israeli military does not yet know how many civilians were killed in its strike on southern Beirut that it says killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, an Israeli military official said Saturday.
     
            “I still don’t know the numbers,” the official said. They also declined to comment on the type of bombs used in the attack.
     
            When asked what kind of collateral damage assessment the Israel Defense Forces carried out ahead of the strike, the official said: “There’s a discussion with an intelligence officer, a surveillance officer (and) a legal officer.”
     
            Israel’s army chief Herzi Halevi has warned that “this is not the end of our toolbox” following the military’s claim that it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a strike on Friday.
     
            “This is not the end of our toolbox. It should be very clear: there are further tools going forward. And the message is clear: anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel, we will know how to reach them, in the north, in the south, and also farther away,” Halevi said in a video released Saturday.
     
            He added that Friday’s strike had been carefully prepared over a long period of time.
     
            “Eventually, after a long period of preparation, of many capabilities for Lebanon, we started implementing them,” he said, adding that the strike “was carried out at the right time, in a very sharp manner, and we are now moving to preparing the next things.”
     
            He ended his video statement by saying that Israel’s military is prepared “along all our fronts.”
     
            The Israeli military claimed Saturday that Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, was killed in Friday’s airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon. Hezbollah has not commented.
     
            The Israeli military claims that Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed alongside Hezbollah commanders in Friday’s airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon.
     
            “Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization and one of its founders, was eliminated by the IDF, together with Ali Karki, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and additional Hezbollah commanders,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Saturday morning.
     
            Prior to last week, it was extraordinarily rare for Israel to strike the Lebanese capital. The IDF continued to strike Beirut overnight, targeting what it said were Hezbollah missile storage facilities. CNN teams witnessed massive explosions reverberating through the capital.
     
            Israeli Air Force jets “conducted a targeted strike on the central headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which was located underground embedded under a residential building in the area of Dahiyeh in Beirut,” the IDF said. “The strike was conducted while Hezbollah’s senior chain of command were operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel.”
     
            Hezbollah began firing on northern Israel the day after Hamas’ October 7 attack on the country. Around 60,000 Israelis have been forced from their homes, whom the Israeli government has committed to returning.
     
            Last week, Israel massively ramped up its military campaign against Hezbollah, killing hundreds and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians, according to the Lebanese government.
     
Hassan Nasrallah, who Israel has claimed was killed in a strike on southern Beirut, turned Hezbollah into one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East.
     
            One of the founding members of the group formed four decades ago with the aid of Iran, Nasrallah ascended to the top of Hezbollah in 1992. He replaced his predecessor and mentor, Abbas Musawi, as secretary-general of Hezbollah, after he was killed by an Israeli helicopter strike.
     
            Born to a grocer and his wife in Beirut in August 1960, Nasrallah spent his early adolescence under the shadow of Lebanon’s civil war.
     
            When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, Nasrallah rallied a group of fighters to resist the occupation – which would evolve into Hezbollah.
     
            The Lebanese militant group grew from a a rag-tag group of militants to a regional fighting force under Nasrallah. He led the growth of Hezbollah’s forces – his fighters and reservists are thought to number 100,000 – as well as the proliferation of its arsenal, which boasts long-range as well as medium and short-range missiles and drones.
     
            In its statement announcing his death, the Israeli military said Nasrallah was responsible for the murder of many Israeli civilians and soldiers, and the planning and execution of thousands of terrorist activities. It called him “the central decision-maker and the strategic leader of the organization.”

            The Israeli military claims that Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Friday’s airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon.
     
            The airstrike targeted Beirut’s densely populated southern suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which have a strong Hezbollah presence.
     
            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Friday that the Israeli military had struck Hezbollah’s headquarters.
     
            Hezbollah has not commented.
     
            Israeli airstrikes hit multiple locations across eastern and southern Lebanon on Saturday morning, the official Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) reported.
     
            The areas hit include towns in Baalbek in the east and Nabatiyeh in the south, NNA said, adding an unspecified number of people had been killed in the attacks.
     
            In a statement Saturday morning, the Israeli military said it conducted “extensive strikes” over the past two hours in the area of Beqaa and in southern Lebanon, claiming it targeted Hezbollah launchers, weapons storage facilities, and infrastructure sites.
     
            CNN cannot independently verify the military’s claim.
     
            Israel detected five more projectiles fired from Lebanon on Saturday morning, setting off sirens across a large area of the north, the Israeli military said.
     
        “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in a number of areas in northern Israel and the areas of Wadi Ara, Samaria and Menashe, five projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanese territory,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement, adding that most had been intercepted.
     
 
            Sirens were activated in more than 100 communities, based on a count of the military’s Home Front Command warning application.
     
            The attack followed an earlier barrage of 10 projectiles detected from the Lebanese side of the border. Hezbollah said earlier it fired rockets toward northern Israel in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanese cities and villages.
     
            Explosions rocked Beirut on Friday and Saturday as Israeli strikes first targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, then several buildings which, it alleges, are storing the militant group’s missiles in the Lebanese capital.
     
While this is a recent escalation in fighting, here’s what to know about their decades-long conflict:
     
Israeli invasion: Israel took almost half of Lebanon’s territory when its forces invaded in 1982, responding to attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organization. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation led to the deaths of over 17,000 people, according to reports and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at a Beirut refugee camp. The investigation held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre carried out by the Christian Lebanese fighters.
     
The rise of Hezbollah: As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist militants trained by Iran burst onto the scene. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel and civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
Support for Gaza: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has increasingly clashed with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started — and has vowed to continue until the war ends.
     
Killing of key leader: Tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, with a strike on Beirut in July. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles into Israel.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both Israel and Lebanon. Israel this month made it a war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. Lebanon has recorded more than 100,000 people displaced, but authorities said the true number is likely much higher.
     
            About 10 projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel Saturday morning, the Israeli military said.
     
        “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in the Upper Galilee area, approximately ten projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,” the Israeli military said in a statement. “Some of the projectiles were intercepted.”
     
 
            Hezbollah said it fired rockets toward northern Israel in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanese cities and villages.
     
            “[Hezbollah militants] bombarded the settlement of Kabri with Fadi-1 rockets,” the group said in a statement on Saturday.
     
            Meanwhile, a CNN team in Beirut saw smoke rising from the city’s southern Dahiyeh neighborhood as the sun rose over Lebanon’s capital.
     
This post has been updated with Hezbollah’s statement.
 
            Israel’s military said it had launched a new round of airstrikes in Lebanon’s Beqaa region, according to a statement on Saturday morning.
     
        “The IDF is now attacking Hezbollah terrorist targets in the Bekaa region of Lebanon,” the statement said.
     
 
            The announcement followed an earlier round of strikes overnight in the area.
     
            Israeli attacks killed at least six Palestinians and injured others in Gaza overnight, according to statements from the Palestinian Civil Defense in the strip.
     
            Four people were killed in the bombardment of a house in Rafah, the Civil Defense spokesperson said in a statement late Friday. Two others were killed in an attack at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, the spokesperson added on Saturday.
     
            CNN cannot independently verify the reports and has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
     
            Hospitals in Beirut’s southern Dahiyeh suburb will be evacuated following deadly Israeli strikes on the area overnight, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health said Saturday.
     
            Israeli military strikes Friday and Saturday flattened buildings in the south of the Lebanese capital, killing at least six people and wounding dozens of others, according to the ministry.
     
        “[We are] calling on hospitals in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, and areas not affected by the Israeli aggression to stop receiving non-emergency cases until the end of next week, to make room for receiving patients from the hospitals in the southern Dahiyeh of Beirut, which will be evacuated due to developments in the aggression,” the ministry said in a statement.
     
 
            It also called on hospitals and health centers to prepare to receive displaced patients from Dahiyeh.
     
            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Friday of “devastating” consequences if Israel engages in an all-out war with Hezbollah, telling CNN in an exclusive interview that casualties would “equal or exceed” the number in Gaza.
     
        “An all-out war between Lebanese, Hezbollah and Israel would be devastating for both Lebanon and Israel. And again, we anticipate that we’d see a number of people displaced, casualties that, you know, equal or exceed what we’ve seen in Gaza,” Austin told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.
     
 
            The defense secretary, reiterating the US’ desire for a “diplomatic solution,” also said a possible ground incursion by Israeli forces into Lebanon risks spiraling the situation into a regional conflict.
     
            The US and several prominent allies believed they had achieved a 21-day pause in fighting that would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said reports of an imminent deal were “incorrect” and vowed to continue to hit the Iran-backed militant group “with all our might.”
     
            Netanyahu spoke at the United Nations General Assembly Friday morning, where he vowed to continue Israel’s military efforts and warned “there is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach.”

            The sun has risen in Beirut after a night of explosions rocked the Lebanese capital, as Israel said it carried out strikes on the headquarters of the Iran-backed paramilitary group Hezbollah and its arms depots.
     
Here’s what we know so far:
 
            It was 3 a.m. and southern Beirut was under the most intense bombardment it had seen in nearly 20 years. A CNN team drove past a sea of people camped out on sidewalks, mostly on the seaside boardwalk that hugs the coast in the still untouched western parts of the city.
     
            These were the displaced from neighborhoods being pummelled by Israeli warplanes. Some were chatting on the curb, a few lay asleep on benches and on the ground. Women cradled sleeping babies and toddlers. Children wandered the streets, snaking through double-parked cars aimlessly in their pyjamas.
     
            On the city’s commercial Hamra Street, a crowd outside an abandoned building forced the traffic to a near stop. A man knocked down the iron gate, allowing a flood of displaced people in for shelter. A fresh wave of arrivals pulled up. Visibly exhausted women emerged from the cars hauling their kids, blankets and mattresses.
     
            Most people were carrying little more than the clothes on their backs as they rushed out in search of safety. Many tried to put on a brave face, the anxiety lying under the thin veneer of bravado. “We’re OK! I’m sure our home is OK. There’s nothing to worry about,” one women in her early 60s told a group of people around her.
     
It was sleepless night in the Lebanese capital. The streets were busier than usual in the early hours of Saturday morning. Restaurants and cafes were open, serving food and coffee as the images of the explosions lighting up the night sky, just a few miles away, flashed on TV screens.
     
            As we crisscrossed the city in our car, the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders for the residents of not yet struck parts of southern Beirut. One of the listed neighborhoods was Bourj el Barajneh, a densely populated area that includes a Palestinian refugee camp and where many poorer migrants live. Less than 30 minutes later, Israeli forces began strikes there.
     
            Whether many of those residents managed to make it out on time is unclear. Meanwhile the people of Beirut wait to see what has become of their homes, their city and its civilians.
     
            Israel’s military said it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, according to a statement on Saturday.
     
            “Over the past hour, the IDF has struck additional terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Beqaa,” the statement said.
     
            The announcement came as dozens of explosions rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
     
            The Beqaa valley, located in the east of the country along the border with Syria, has come under repeated Israeli airstrikes over the past week.
     
            On Thursday, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned that humanitarian needs in the area were outpacing the capacity of aid agencies to respond with residents forced to flee their homes and shelters struggling to house them.
     
            The Israeli military issued another evacuation order for residents of Al-Barajneh and Al-Hadath neighborhoods to leave specific locations indicated on maps in Beirut’s southern Dahiyeh.
     
        “You are present near Hezbollah facilities and for the safety of you and your loved ones, you are obliged to evacuate the buildings immediately and move away from them for a distance of no less than 500 meters,” the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement on Saturday.
     
 
            Those buildings include some near a school in the Al-Barajneh neighborhood, a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp that is also home to Syrian refugees and migrant workers. Adraee also ordered residents to evacuate the buildings in front of and near another school in Al-Hadath.
     
            Shortly after the evacuation order was issued, a CNN team in Beirut saw at least four airstrikes hit multiple locations in the southern suburbs.
     
            The evacuation order comes after an earlier one in which Adraee also told residents in several buildings in the Al-Laylaki neighborhood to evacuate, as well as in Al-Hadath.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it is striking buildings in Beirut, Lebanon, that it alleges are used by Hezbollah as command centers and weapons production and storage sites.
     
        “Following precise IDF intelligence, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) is currently conducting strikes on strategic terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Beirut. Among the targets struck are weapons production facilities, buildings used to store advanced weapons and key command centers of the terrorist organization,” the IDF said in a statement.
     
 
            The statement comes hours after the IDF began striking buildings in the Dahiyeh neighborhood in southern Beirut.
     
            Hezbollah has denied that its weapons are being stored in civilian buildings targeted by Israeli strikes.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-09-27-24/index.html,Israel carries out deadly strikes on Lebanon’s capital,Large blasts hit Lebanon’s capital of Beirut after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a combative speech at the UN General Assembly. Follow for live news updates.,"Sep 28, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Lex Harvey,Middle East,"
            • Explosions rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday as Israel said it struck Hezbollah’s headquarters. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the target, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            • The strikes flattened buildings in a densely populated area, killing at least six people and wounding dozens of others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel has launched further strikes on southern Beirut, targeting what it says are stores of Hezbollah weapons.
     
            • Israel didn’t notify the US about the strikes until the attack was underway, according to the US defense secretary. Sources say the lack of notice added to US frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has sent mixed messages on a US-led ceasefire proposal and made a combative speech at the UN General Assembly earlier Friday.
     
            • Lebanon has recorded more than 100,000 people displaced by the recent conflict, but authorities said the true number is likely much higher. Up to half a million people are likely internally displaced, Lebanon’s health minister told CNN.
     
Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
 
            About 10 projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel Saturday morning, the Israeli military said.
     
            “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in the Upper Galilee area, approximately ten projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,” the Israeli military said in a statement. “Some of the projectiles were intercepted.”
     
            Hezbollah has not issued any statements claiming responsibility for the attack.
     
            Meanwhile, a CNN team in Beirut saw smoke rising from the city’s southern Dahiyeh neighborhood as the sun rose over Lebanon’s capital.
     
            It was 3 a.m. and southern Beirut was under the most intense bombardment it had seen in nearly 20 years. A CNN team drove past a sea of people camped out on sidewalks, mostly on the seaside boardwalk that hugs the coast in the still untouched western parts of the city.
     
            These were the displaced from neighborhoods being pummelled by Israeli warplanes. Some were chatting on the curb, a few lay asleep on benches and on the ground. Women cradled sleeping babies and toddlers. Children wandered the streets, snaking through double-parked cars aimlessly in their pyjamas.
     
            On the city’s commercial Hamra Street, a crowd outside an abandoned building forced the traffic to a near stop. A man knocked down the iron gate, allowing a flood of displaced people in for shelter. A fresh wave of arrivals pulled up. Visibly exhausted women emerged from the cars hauling their kids, blankets and mattresses.
     
            Most people were carrying little more than the clothes on their backs as they rushed out in search of safety. Many tried to put on a brave face, the anxiety lying under the thin veneer of bravado. “We’re OK! I’m sure our home is OK. There’s nothing to worry about,” one women in her early 60s told a group of people around her.
     
This is a sleepless night in the Lebanese capital. The streets were busier than usual in the early hours of Saturday morning. Restaurants and cafes were open, serving food and coffee as the images of the explosions lighting up the night sky, just a few miles away, flashed on TV screens.
     
            As we crisscrossed the city in our car, the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders for the residents of not yet struck parts of southern Beirut. One of the listed neighborhoods was Bourj el Barajneh, a densely populated area that includes a Palestinian refugee camp and where many poorer migrants live. Less than 30 minutes later, Israeli forces began strikes there.
     
            Whether many of those residents managed to make it out on time is unclear. Meanwhile the people of Beirut wait for the sun to rise, to see what has become of their homes, their city and its civilians.
     
            The pace of Israeli airstrikes is now continuous in Beirut after being intermittent earlier in the night, according to CNN’s crew in the Lebanese capital.
     
            The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for residents of Beirut’s southern Dahiyeh suburb but left little time between the orders and the commencement of additional strikes.
     
            Hundreds of families have gathered on the Beirut waterfront to escape the bombardment.
     
            Israel’s military said it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, according to a statement on Saturday.
     
            “Over the past hour, the IDF has struck additional terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Beqaa,” the statement said.
     
            The announcement came as dozens of explosions rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
     
            The Beqaa valley, located in the east of the country along the border with Syria, has come under repeated Israeli airstrikes over the past week.
     
            On Thursday, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned that humanitarian needs in the area were outpacing the capacity of aid agencies to respond with residents forced to flee their homes and shelters struggling to house them.
     
            The Israeli military issued another evacuation order for residents of Al-Barajneh and Al-Hadath neighborhoods to leave specific locations indicated on maps in Beirut’s southern Dahiyeh.
     
            “You are present near Hezbollah facilities and for the safety of you and your loved ones, you are obliged to evacuate the buildings immediately and move away from them for a distance of no less than 500 meters,” the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement on Saturday.
     
            Those buildings include some near a school in the Al-Barajneh neighborhood, a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp that is also home to Syrian refugees and migrant workers. Adraee also ordered residents to evacuate the buildings in front of and near another school in Al-Hadath.
     
            Shortly after the evacuation order was issued, a CNN team in Beirut saw at least four airstrikes hit multiple locations in the southern suburbs.
     
            The evacuation order comes after an earlier one in which Adraee also told residents in several buildings in the Al-Laylaki neighborhood to evacuate, as well as in Al-Hadath.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it is currently striking buildings in Beirut, Lebanon, that it alleges are used by Hezbollah as command centers and weapons production and storage sites.
     
            “Following precise IDF intelligence, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) is currently conducting strikes on strategic terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Beirut. Among the targets struck are weapons production facilities, buildings used to store advanced weapons and key command centers of the terrorist organization,” the IDF said in a statement.
     
            The statement comes hours after the IDF began striking buildings in the Dahiyeh neighborhood in southern Beirut.
     
            Hezbollah has denied that its weapons are being stored in civilian buildings targeted by Israeli strikes.
     
            The sun was setting on Beirut, casting a warm glow over the city’s coastal skyline. Suddenly, a succession of loud bangs rang out and a plume of smoke rose from the city’s southern suburbs. The images broadcast on local TV later showed a yawning chasm where six buildings had just been, rescuers navigating the rubble dwarfed by the enormity of the crater.
     
            Israel said it targeted Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Shia Islamist militant group Hezbollah. Nasrallah has led the armed group for more than 30 years, presiding over its rise from a guerrilla organization to the best-armed non-state force in the Middle East. His influence extends well beyond Lebanon’s borders – commanding a following from Muslim Shia groups across the region.
     
            The enormity of the strike – which is believed to have involved 2,000-pound bombs – seemed to match the gravity of the moment. This was the doomsday scenario many in Lebanon and across the region feared – both Nasrallah’s admirers, and many of his detractors.
     
            “Would they really do this? Would they really go after him?” one dumbfounded elderly woman, displaced by Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon, wondered aloud.
     
            While it remains unclear whether Nasrallah was among the victims of the blast, its repercussions have already thrust the Middle East into the unknown.
     
            Hezbollah has neither confirmed nor denied Nasrallah’s killing. Shortly after the massive strike, the Israeli military announced a fresh wave of strikes in southern Beirut. From a rooftop in the west of the city, CNN could see the bright red of explosions light up the night sky, spanning the breadth of the densely populated area where Hezbollah has a strong presence, and where much of its leadership is based.
     
            These explosions are smaller than the strike that targeted Nasrallah. But they have already displaced thousands of people, sending them to shelters in other parts of Beirut. In their desperation, many have taken to sidewalks of the relatively safe western part of the capital, namely the seaside boardwalk known as the Corniche.
     
            For hours, the sirens of ambulances, the rumble of warplanes overhead, and the loud buzz of drones have intermingled. And the cries of those civilians caught in the middle, faced with the specter of a cataclysmic war, rise barely above a whimper.
     
            The Israeli military says it killed Hezbollah commanders during Friday’s strikes in Lebanon.
     
        “The IAF (Israeli Air Force) struck and eliminated the terrorist Muhammad Ali Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile unit in southern Lebanon, and his deputy, the terrorist Hussein Ahmad Ismail,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in the early hours of Saturday, local time.
     
 
            “Additional Hezbollah commanders and operatives were eliminated alongside them,” the IDF added.
     
            The IDF said Muhammad Ali Ismail was responsible for directing attacks against Israel, including the launch of a surface-to-air missile on Wednesday.
     
            Hezbollah has not confirmed the deaths of these figures.
     
            Israeli strikes hit Lebanon throughout Friday, including in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the IDF said it was conducting “targeted strikes” on Hezbollah weapons stored beneath civilian buildings.
     
            Hezbollah has denied that its weapons were being stored in civilian buildings targeted by Israeli strikes on the Dahiyeh area of southern Beirut on Friday.
     
        “The claims made by the enemy regarding the presence of weapons in the bombed civilian buildings are completely false,” Hezbollah said in its first official comments on the airstrikes.
     
 
            Explosions continue to rock the Lebanese capital early Saturday morning local time.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces previously said it was “conducting targeted strikes on weapons belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization that were stored beneath civilian buildings,” and had told residents to evacuate certain areas.
     
            The latest strikes come hours after an initial Israeli attack on what it said was Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut on Friday. That operation flattened several buildings in a densely populated area, killing at least six people and wounding dozens of others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Rescuers are still searching for survivors and any further victims, warning the current death toll is not final.
     
            The Israeli military continues to strike southern Beirut, a CNN team in the Lebanese capital reports.
     
            More than an hour after the Israel Defense Forces began striking buildings allegedly with Hezbollah missiles in them, airstrikes continue to hit the Dahiyeh neighborhood in southern Beirut, CNN can see.
     
            Large flashes can be seen in southern Beirut, and the thuds of impacting Israeli missiles are echoing across the capital.
     
            A crisis management center in Beirut is urging displaced people to contact it for immediate assistance in finding shelter.
     
            The government-run Crisis Management Room published two phone numbers for those seeking shelter to call in a statement by the state-run news agency NNA.
     
            The move comes after the Israeli military warned residents of several neighborhoods in southern Beirut to evacuate, and then began striking buildings in the area that it alleged were being used to store Hezbollah missiles.
     
            The Lebanese government says tens of thousands of people have been displaced due to recent fighting at its southern border with Israel.
     
            US President Joe Biden has been briefed “several times today” by his national security team following a series of Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah in Beirut, Lebanon, an official told reporters traveling with Biden in Delaware Friday.
     
            Biden has ordered the Pentagon to look at the US force posture in the region and “adjust as necessary” to support US objectives, the official said, adding that the president has also directed embassies to take the appropriate protective measures.
     
            He will continue to receive “regular updates,” they added.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces is currently striking buildings in Beirut that it alleges are storing Hezbollah missiles.
     
            “The IDF is currently conducting targeted strikes on weapons belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization that were stored beneath civilian buildings in the area of Dahiyeh in Beirut,” the IDF said in a statement.
     
            The strikes came about 90 minutes after the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesperson issued a warning on X, formerly Twitter, for residents of several southern Beirut neighborhoods to leave the vicinity of buildings it identified on a map.
     
From the ground: CNN’s team in Beirut has heard explosions and can see smoke rising over the southern Dahiyeh neighborhood.
     
            At least six people were killed and 91 injured by Israel’s strikes in Beirut Friday, the Lebanese health ministry said.
     
            The casualty count is “not final,” and rescuers continue to search for victims, it added.
     
            Moody’s Ratings cut Israel’s sovereign credit rating on Friday over worries about prolonged conflicts in the Middle East and Israel’s domestic political situation, the second such cut this year.
     
        “The intensity of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has increased significantly in recent days. This is in the context of Israel’s publicly-stated objective to return its evacuated residents back to the North of the country. Achieving this objective is likely to involve a yet more intense conflict. At the same time, prospects for a ceasefire in Gaza have receded and we assess that domestic political risks have increased alongside geopolitical risks,” Moody’s said in a statement.
     
 
            A country’s credit rating can help investors decide if it’s worth loaning the country money, such as by buying securities like bonds. A lower credit rating can give investors pause and, in turn, demand higher interest rates for their money. Moody’s cut Israel to Baa1 from A2.
     
            Moody’s had already downgraded Israel’s rating in February. This time, however, Moody’s analysts noted that, “Longer term, we consider that Israel’s economy will be more durably weakened by the military conflict than expected earlier.”
     
            The outlook remains negative, which means Moody’s could cut again in the future.
     
            The Israeli military in the early hours of Saturday morning warned it will not allow airplanes carrying weapons to land at the airport in Beirut, Lebanon.
     
        “Air Force planes are now patrolling the area of ​​the Beirut airport,” Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said in a press statement.
     
 
            CNN’s team in Beirut can hear the warplanes in the sky.
     
            “The state of Lebanon, unlike Syria, has behaved responsibly over the years and has not allowed the transfer of weapons through the civilian airports,” Hagari said. “We inform you in advance that we will not allow hostile flights with weapons to land at the civilian airport and clarity: this is a civilian airport for civilian use and must be kept as such.”
     
            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that his call today with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant happened as the operation targeting Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut was “already underway.”
     
        “The United States was not involved in Israel’s operation. We had no advance warning. My call with Minister Gallant took place while the operation was actually already underway,” Austin said after landing at Joint Base Andrews from his trip to the United Kingdom.
     
 
            Austin emphasized that the US is still gathering information on the strike.
     
            He also stressed the need to avoid “an all-out war.”
     
            “Diplomacy continues to be the best way forward, and it’s the fastest way to let displaced Israeli and Lebanese citizens return to their homes on both sides of the border,” said Austin.
     
            The defense secretary also said he would be speaking again with Gallant “soon,” and that he would “look to get an update from him when we have that conversation.”
     
Some context: Sources told CNN earlier Friday that Israel’s last-minute notification of the US about the strikes had added to US officials’ mounting frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.
     
            Netanyahu has sent mixed messages this week on a US-led ceasfire proposal for the Israel-Lebanon border, and the Israeli leader made a combative speech at the UN General Assembly today, vowing to continue the fight with Hezbollah.
     
            The Israeli military says it will “in a short time” attack buildings in southern Beirut that it claims are storing Hezbollah missiles.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces used its Arabic-language spokesperson late Friday night to tell residents of several neighborhoods in southern Beirut to leave specific areas.
     
        “In the heart of the Dahiya in Beirut, Hezbollah constructed three buildings with designated underground spaces for storing strategic weapons, with the buildings above acting as a shield,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, claimed during a news conference in the early hours of Saturday morning local time.
     
 
            The buildings surrounding the structures indicated by the IDF are almost entirely residential.
     
            “The way the missiles are stored in these buildings allows them to be moved and launched outside of the buildings within minutes. This poses a real and immediate threat to global shipping routes and Israel’s strategic infrastructure,” Hagari claimed.
     
            The spokesperson said residents “must move as far away from the buildings as possible.”
     
        “In a short time, we will stack the weapons stored beneath the buildings. The explosion, because of the missiles may damage the structure and could potentially cause them to collapse,” he said.
     
 
            Iran has condemned Israel’s deadly strikes on Beirut, calling the attack a “war crime” and claiming the US is complicit.
     
            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian described the strikes as a “flagrant war crime” that “once again reveals the terrorist nature of the Israeli regime,” the state news agency Press TV reported.
     
            Iran’s foreign ministry also denounced the strikes in Beirut’s suburbs, describing the attack as a “barbaric” act facilitated by American-supplied bombs.
     
        “While the Israeli regime must be held accountable for the atrocity crimes they have been committing in occupied Palestine and Lebanon, one cannot disregard the US complicity,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said while addressing the UN Security Council on Friday, adding that, “Israel’s war-mongering relies on US military support and political backing.”
     
 
            Both the Israeli and American governments should be held accountable, the ministry’s spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said.
     
            “The ongoing Israeli aggression against Palestine and Lebanon exposes the hollow nature of Western calls for ceasefire, serving only to prolong Zionist atrocities,” Kanaani added.
     
What the US is saying: Israel notified the US — which has been pushing for ceasefire deals in both Gaza and at the Israel-Lebanon border — only moments before it carried out Friday’s strikes, the US defense secretary said Friday.
     
            President Joe Biden told reporters the US had “no knowledge of or participation in” the attack.
     
This post has been updated with additional comments from the Iranian foreign ministry.
 
            Several big explosions rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday as Israel said it carried out strikes on the headquarters of the Iran-backed paramilitary group Hezbollah.
     
            Here’s what we know so far:
     
Where: CNN has geolocated a video shared on social media which showed multiple large plumes of smoke in an area of the city’s southern suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which is a densely populated area with a strong Hezbollah presence, and where many of the group’s leadership is based.
     
Intended target: Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of Israel’s strikes, an Israeli official told CNN. The country’s military is now working to verify whether he was killed in the strike, with a senior Israeli official saying it’s “too early to say” if Nasrallah is dead.
     
Impact: At least two people were killed and 76 injured, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said. Six buildings were completely destroyed, state news agency NNA reported. Video from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed a massive crater that dwarfed the rescuers navigating the rubble nearby. The area affected by the strikes appeared to be considerably larger than previous Israeli strikes on Beirut.
     
Weapons used: Images of the aftermath of Israeli strikes on Beirut suggest 2,000-pound bombs were used, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal expert has told CNN.
     
            “With the level of damage, it is hard to determine the exact munitions and amount, but likely multiple 2,000-pound bombs, Mk 84s, MPR-2000, or BLU-109 “bunker busters,” or a combination of them,” specialist Trevor Ball said after analyzing video and images of the strike on the Lebanese capital.
     
What Lebanon has said: Prime Minister Najib Mikati has urged the international community to help stop what he called Israeli “tyranny,” state news agency NNA reported Friday.
     
Netanyahu’s movements: The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office shared an image of Benjamin Netanyahu approving a strike on Beirut. He is returning to Israel a day early from the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he made a combative speech earlier today.
     
Iran’s response: The Iranian embassy in Beirut said the Israeli strike Friday “changes the rules of the game,” and warned that Israel would be “punished” for what the country’s president described as a “flagrant war crime.”
     
United States frustrated: Israel informed the US they were taking military action only moments before the strike — once the operation was already underway, one US official said, adding that that “does not qualify as a heads up.” President Joe Biden later told reporters the US had “no knowledge of or participation in” the attack.
     
            Top Biden administration officials were already furious this week after Netanyahu threw cold water on a US-backed ceasefire proposal for Israel and Hezbollah, sources tell CNN.
     
            A former senior Israeli official told CNN the military would not have attacked its target in Beirut on Friday if it was not certain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was there.
     
        “Israel would not have attacked with such scope and power, if it was not sure with a very high degree of certainty that the ultra-terrorist was there,” the former official said.
     
 
            A current Israeli official told CNN earlier Friday that Nasrallah had been the target of the strike.
     
            Now the military is assessing the results, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said at a news conference Friday, describing the strike as “very precise.”
     
            Israel’s attack rocked Lebanon’s capital with explosions, flattening buildings in a densely populated area. The strikes killed at least two people and wounded dozens of others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.
     
            The Israeli military has told residents to leave parts of several neighborhoods in southern Beirut, highlighting those locations on maps that were distributed on the social media platform X.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces’ Arabic-language spokesperson posted maps of several buildings in the Al-Laylaki and Al-Hadath neighborhoods.
     
        “You are located near Hezbollah interests and for your safety and the safety of your loved ones, you are obliged to evacuate the buildings immediately and move away from them at a distance of no less than 500 meters,” Avichay Adraee said in a post on X.
     
 
            This call for evacuations comes hours after Israel launched major airstrikes in southern Beirut, in an attack an Israeli official told CNN targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
            At the opening of a United Nations Security Council meeting, UN Secretary-General António Guterres made the case that “international humanitarian law is in tatters” amid the war in Gaza.
     
            He said the rate of killing there surpasses anything he has seen in his role.
     
        “The speed and scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza are unlike anything in my years as secretary-general. Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” Guterres said.
     
 
            Guterres also spoke about Friday’s Israeli strikes on Beirut, warning that “war in Lebanon could lead to further escalation involving outside powers.” He urged the two sides to agree to a proposed temporary ceasefire at the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            “We need this ceasefire now. We cannot afford endless negotiations, as we have on Gaza,” Guterres said. “We must avoid a regional war at all costs. Gaza remains the epicenter of the violence. And Gaza is key to ending it.”
     
Remember: Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed paramilitary group based in Lebanon, have been in conflict for decades, but the fighting has intensified since Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel and the ensuing Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead.
     
            Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has decided to end the meetings he was holding in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and return home, following Israeli strikes that rocked southern Beirut on Friday.
     
            Mikati decided government meetings would continue and an emergency meeting would be held as soon as he returned to Beirut, a statement from his office said.
     
            Hezbollah has struck the city of Safed in northern Israel, according to the Israeli military and local authorities.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said Hezbollah fired around 30 rockets, some of which were intercepted. At least two rockets hit the city, according to Safed municipal officials.
     
            Israeli Fire and Rescue services said four crews were working to put out fires caused by the strikes. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but first responders were still searching for any people who may have been trapped.
     
            Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the strikes, saying they were in support of “the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” as well as “in defense of Lebanon and its people.”
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking hours after a major Israeli strike in Lebanon targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, made a forceful plea for diplomacy in the Middle East, saying that while Israel has the right to defend itself, “the way it does so matters.”
     
        “The choices that all parties make in the coming days will determine which path this region is on, with profound consequences for its people, now and possibly for years to come,” Blinken said at a news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
     
 
            Blinken warned that not pursing diplomacy would lead to “more conflict, more violence, more suffering, and greater instability and insecurity, the ripples of which will be felt around the world.”
     
            The top US diplomat claimed that a path to diplomacy still exists, though it “may seem difficult to see at this moment.”
     
            “In our judgment, it is necessary and we will continue to work intensely with all parties to urge them to choose that course,” he said.
     
            Blinken’s comments also come days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled his unwillingness to agree to a ceasefire proposal championed by the US.
     
            Blinken also echoed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s recent comments warning other parties in the region such as Iran not to use the escalation between Israel and Lebanon to target US assets in the region.
     
            The Israeli military says it has struck Hezbollah targets “in the south and deep into Lebanon.”
     
            The strikes targeted launchers and buildings where weapons were stored, the Israel Defense Forces said, as it attempts to “degrade and dismantle” the group’s infrastructure and capabilities.
     
            Earlier Friday, Israel targeted Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in strikes on the Lebanese capital of Beirut, an Israeli official told CNN. The Iran-backed paramilitary group has not commented on Nasrallah’s fate.
     
            A senior Israeli official said it is “too early to say” whether Friday’s strike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was successful.
     
            The official added, “it’s a question of time…,” noting that it took weeks to confirm that an Israeli operation was successful in killing Hamas leader Mohammed Deif in Gaza in the summer.
     
            The official said the decision to target Nasrallah was a “very tough call,” and said confirmation could come at any moment, noting it “depends on the intelligence, they usually try to hide it.”
     
            When asked whether Nasrallah is alive or dead following themassive Israeli strike in Beirut, a Lebanese security official told CNN: “We wait.”
     
            US President Joe Biden said he’s waiting for more information before commenting on Israel’s Friday airstrikes in Beirut, reiterating that the US was not involved in the Israel Defense Forces operation.
     
        “We’re still gathering information, I can tell you — the United States had no knowledge of or participation in the IDF action. We’re gathering more information. I’ll have more to say when we have more information,” Biden told reporters traveling with him in Delaware.
     
 
            CNN reported earlier Friday that, according to a US official, Israel informed the United States of the operation once it was already underway and Israel had planes in the air.
     
            “We had no foreknowledge of this and that does not qualify as a heads up,” the official said.
     
            An Israeli official told CNN the notification was sent “shortly before” the strike, and the US did not play a role in the operation.
     
            Pressed if he believed the strikes — which CNN has reported were targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah — were justified, Biden declined to say.
     
            “We have to get more detail, he said. “I don’t know enough to answer that question.”
     
            He said he’s “always concerned,” about the conflict escalating tensions in the region.
     
Blinken comments: Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said Friday that the US is still trying to learn more about the Israeli strikes.
     
            “We are still gathering information, making sure that we fully understand what happened, what the intent was — and until we have that information, I can’t address in detail our response to it, so we’ll continue to work on that in the hours ahead,” Blinken said at a news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
     
            The top US diplomat again stressed the need to pursue a diplomatic solution to the tensions in the region and to avoid a wider war.

            The UK’s Foreign Office has urged British nationals in Lebanon to leave at the earliest opportunity.
     
            In a statement, the Foreign Office advised Britons to take the next flight available and said that efforts were underway to increase capacity.
     
            The Iranian embassy in Beirut said the Israeli strike Friday “changes the rules of the game” and warned Israel would be “punished.”
     
            “The Israeli regime once again commits a bloody massacre, targeting heavily populated residential neighborhoods, spewing false justifications to try and cover up its brutal crimes,” the embassy posted on X (formerly Twitter).
     
            “There is no doubt that this reprehensible crime and reckless behavior represent a serious escalation that changes the rules of the game, and that its perpetrator will be punished appropriately,” it added. 
 
            At least two people were killed and 76 injured by several Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said Friday.
     
            The ministry added this was a preliminary casualty count. Rescuers continue to search through the rubble and the ministry “expects the casualty count to rise in the coming hours.”
     
            An Israeli official told CNN that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes on Friday.
     
            Top Biden administration officials were furious Thursday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threw cold water on an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire proposal that a group of nations led by the US released Wednesday night, prompting them to demand that the Israelis put out a public statement to remedy the diplomatic embarrassment, sources tell CNN.
     
            Leading up to Wednesday, US officials had been given every assurance by Ron Dermer – one of Netanyahu’s closest confidants – that the prime minister was on board with the ceasefire framework that suggests a pause in hostilities for 21 days across the Israel-Lebanon border. Sources said Dermer himself had seen – and approved – the text of the proposal.
     
            But within hours of the Biden White House announcing the ceasefire proposal, Netanyahu and his office dismissed it, calling the idea of an imminent ceasefire “incorrect,” while the prime minister vowed to continue Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah.
     
            Angry senior US officials – convinced that Netanyahu was reacting to backlash at home from far-right members of his government – scrambled to get answers from their Israeli counterparts.
     
            When Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Dermer in New York City Thursday, for example, he demanded that the Israelis put out a public statement, according to one official. That, in part, appeared to prompt the prime minister’s office to release a statement on Thursday that said discussions about the ceasefire proposal would continue in the coming days. That statement did not explicitly accept or reject the proposal.
     
            “Israel appreciates the US efforts in this regard because the US role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region,” the statement said.
     
            A source familiar with Blinken’s lengthy meeting with Dermer on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly would only describe it as candid.
     
            Prior to seeing Blinken, Dermer also saw top White House officials including Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein. Those meetings were described by a source as “frank.” McGurk and Hochstein were among the senior officials who believed that because Dermer had been involved in the process of drafting the ceasefire proposal, Netanyahu was on board.
     
What Israel is saying: A senior Israeli official said Friday that all the confusion and contradiction over the ceasefire proposal “was an honest misunderstanding” between Israel and the US.
     
            There were still questions that needed to be answered before Israel agreed to the proposal, a second Israeli official said.
     
            “What happens in a ceasefire? Can they (Hezbollah) re-arm?” the official asked. “Can they bring in weapons, not only through the Beirut airport, how about the Syrian border?”
     
            “Obviously it requires serious discussion,” they added.
     
This post has been updated with comment from Israeli officials.
 
CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Alex Marquardt contributed reporting to this post.
 
            Six buildings were completely destroyed by several Israeli strikes on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut, state news agency NNA reported Friday.
     
            Video from the immediate aftermath of the explosion showed a massive crater that dwarfed the rescuers navigating the rubble nearby.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is returning to Israel from New York a day early.
     
            He had originally been slated to return on Saturday after his address to the United Nations General Assembly, but the Prime Minister’s Office said that he would now depart Friday evening.
     
            The Israeli military has “high preparedness in attack and defense in all sectors,” according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released soon after it carried out a large airstrike in Beirut targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
     
        “IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has now completed a situational assessment with the General Staff Forum after the attack on the Hezbollah headquarters, and emphasized the IDF’s high preparedness in attack and defense in all sectors,” the military said.
     
 
Some background: Intense Israeli airstrikes have been targeting the militant group in Lebanon. Monday saw the deadliest day for the country in two decades, when Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others.
     
            Israel has focused most of its offensive in southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is strongest, but it also carried out two airstrikes in the Harbata plain, in the Baalbek district, in the northern part of Lebanon.
     
            Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has urged the international community to help stop what he called Israeli “tyranny” following a series of strikes on Beirut, state news agency NNA reported Friday.“The new aggression proves that the Israeli enemy does not care about international efforts and calls for a ceasefire,” Mikati said in New York, NNA reported.
     
            Mikati added that the current situation meant the international community had a responsibility “in deterring this enemy, and stopping its tyranny and the war of extermination it is waging against Lebanon.”
     
            The prime minister was in touch with the coordinator of the National Committee for Coordination of Disaster and Crisis Response Operations, Minister Nasser Yassin, and had ordered a full mobilization of the relevant agencies to deal with what is expected to be a high number of casualties, NNA said.
     
            Israel notified the United States only moments before the Beirut strike on Friday, according to an Israeli official and two US officials. It is not immediately clear whether the target was shared with the US.
     
            One of the US officials said Israel informed the US government they were taking military action once the operation was already underway and Israel had planes in the air.
     
“We had no foreknowledge of this and that does not qualify as a heads up,” the US official said. The Israeli official said the notification was sent “shortly before” the strike, and the US did not play a role in the operation.
 
 
            CNN reported earlier that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of Israel’s strike.
 
            The Israeli military is working to verify whether he was killed in the strike.
     
Context: This is the second time in a matter of days that US officials have expressed frustration about the notification — or lack thereof — before major Israeli operations in Lebanon.
     
            Before Israel caused hundreds of Hezbollah pagers to explode 10 days ago, Israeli officials notified the US that something was coming in Lebanon. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had spoken with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that morning, relaying the message. But the heads up lacked any substantive details, officials said, leaving the US in the dark about what Israel was planning. The US only learned about the operation when reports of exploding pagers began emerging from Lebanon. And there was no additional notification given before walkie-talkies began exploding in Lebanon one day later, officials said.
     
            On Friday, Israel notified the US of another operation in Lebanon ahead of the strikes, an Israeli official said. Once again, Gallant spoke with Austin before the massive strikes, according to the Pentagon.
     
            But by that time, “the operation was already underway,” said deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.
     
            “We had no advance warning,” said Singh, declining to say whether Gallant told the US that the target was Nasrallah. “Having no involvement, having no knowledge that the strike was actually going to occur, we’re still pulling for more details and trying to understand the operation itself.”
     
            Following several explosions in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office shared an image of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approving a strike on the Lebanese capital.
     
            When asked whether Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is alive or dead following a massive Israeli strike in Beirut, a Lebanese security official told CNN: “We wait.”
     
            Nasrallah was the target of Israel’s strike in the Lebanese capital Beirut, an Israeli official told CNN, adding that the Israeli military is working to verify whether he was killed.
     
            Images of the aftermath of Israeli strikes on Beirut suggest 2,000-pound bombs were used, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal expert has told CNN.
     
            “With the level of damage, it is hard to determine the exact munitions and amount, but likely multiple 2,000-pound bombs, Mk 84s, MPR-2000, or BLU-109 “bunker busters,” or a combination of them,” specialist Trevor Ball said after analyzing video and images of the strike on the Lebanese capital.
     
            Video from the immediate aftermath of the explosion shows a massive crater, the bottom of which is not visible. Rescuers navigating the rubble are dwarfed by the size of the hole.
     
            Video from Hezbollah-owned Al Manar broadcasting, which filmed live from the scene, also shows rubble, fires and extensive damage.
     
            An Israeli official told CNN that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of Israel’s Friday strike.
     
            Emergency responders were dispatched to the scene of Israeli strikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday. The strikes, which the IDF said targeted Hezbollah’s headquarters and leader Hassan Nasrallah, have left several buildings in ruins.
     
            See pictures from the scene:
     
            Several buildings were destroyed in the Dahiyeh area of Beirut’s southern suburbs after several Israeli strikes on the Lebanese capital on Friday, the country’s state news agency reported.
     
            Several videos posted on social media showed large plumes of black smoke rising in the air after the strike. One video showed several large consecutive explosions along several buildings, suggesting Israeli forces fired at multiple targets.
     
            The targeted buildings appeared to have been reduced to rubble in footage shared by some neighbors, with first responders seen arriving at the scene on foot.
     
            The area affected by the strikes appeared to be considerably larger than previous Israeli strikes on Beirut.
     
            The Lebanese Red Cross said it had dispatched 10 of its teams to the southern suburbs following the strike.
     
Some background: Dahiyeh is a densely populated area with a strong Hezbollah presence, and where many of the group’s leadership is based. An Israeli official told CNN that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of Israel’s Friday strike.
     
            Intense Israeli airstrikes have been targeting the militant group in Lebanon. Monday saw the deadliest day for the country in two decades, when Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others.

            The Israeli military is working to verify whether he was killed in the strike, the official said.
     
            Several big explosions rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday, CNN teams on the ground witnessed.
     
            CNN has geolocated a video shared on social media which showed multiple large plumes of smoke in an area of the city’s southern suburbs known as Dahiyeh, in the aftermath of the strikes. It comes after CNN teams heard a series of very loud booms.
     
            Dahiyeh is a densely populated area with a strong Hezbollah presence, and where many of the group’s leadership is based.
     
            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a brief video statement that the Israeli military had struck Hezbollah’s headquarters.
     
            “Moments ago, the Israel Defense Forces carried out a precise strike on the central headquarters of the Hezbollah terror organization that served as the epicenter of Hezbollah’s terror,” Hagari said.
     
            “Hezbollah’s terror headquarters was intentionally built under residential buildings in the heart of Beirut, as part of Hezbollah’s strategy of using human shields,” he added.
     
            Gideon Levy, a former adviser to former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, described the current prime minister’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday as “embarrassing and pathetic.”
     
            While acknowledging that Benjamin Netanyahu is an “impressive” public speaker, Levy told CNN’s Becky Anderson that he reached “one of the lowest points of Israeli propaganda.”
     
            Levy pointed to Netanyahu’s hypocrisy, saying that Israel had killed over 40,000 people in Gaza and turned it into nothing but a humanitarian catastrophe, but the prime minister was still talking about “blessing” the region.
     
            He also pointed to a “radicalization” of Israel, saying that Netanyahu was a “hostage of the most radical, fascist partners in his coalition.”
     
            The US Navy intercepted a Houthi barrage launched at three of its warships in the Red Sea on Thursday, according to two US defense officials.
     
            It was one of the largest attacks yet on US warships operating in the Middle East, one of the officials said.
     
            The barrage was launched from the Iranian-backed rebel group toward two guided-missile destroyers (the USS Spruance and USS Stockdale) and a littoral combat ship (the USS Indianapolis) as they traveled north through the Bab el-Mandeb strait. The critical waterway connects the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea.
     
            Houthi army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yehya Saree said the vessels were targeted “while they were en route to support and assist the Israeli enemy.” Saree said the attack involved a total of 23 projectiles, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, and was launched by the Houthi Navy, Air Force and Missile Force.
     
            Saree asserted the operation resulted in “direct hits,” a claim rejected by the two US officials.
     
            Since the start of the war in Gaza, the Houthis have carried out a series of attacks on US warships and commercial vessels they claim are linked in some way to Israel.
     
            In December, the USS Carney shot down 14 Houthi drones targeting the guided-missile destroyer.  When the Carney returned home several months later, the US Navy chief said the ship carried out more enemy engagements than any other ship since World War II.
     
            Then in February, a Houthi cruise missile got within one mile of the destroyer USS Gravely, forcing it to use its defensive Gatling gun, dubbed the Navy’s “last line of defense.”
     
            Families of people who are unaccounted for in Gaza converged on a container that was dumped in Khan Younis this week, in a desperate and unlikely effort to find and bury loved ones who had been missing for months.
     
            The container was sent across the border from Israel, with 88 decomposing bodies inside. The corpses had been taken to Israel for DNA tests, to ensure there were no Israeli hostages among them.
     
            None of the bodies sent back were identified, and the International Committee for the Red Cross said it was not involved in the transfer. The Gaza Health Ministry initially refused to accept the bodies because they had been sent back without any identification.
     
            A journalist working for CNN said the stench emanating from the container while it was parked at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis was unbearable.
     
            One of those courageous enough to search among the corpses was Umm Mahmoud Yaseen, who last saw her son on October 7, the day of the Hamas attack on Israel. “How are we supposed to identify our children when their bodies are decomposed. I want to see my son, and the bodies are not identified. I can remember what he was wearing when he left the house…”
     
            CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about the latest transfer. The International Committee of the Red Cross said that “all families have the right to receive news about their loved ones and bury them respectfully.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said that normalized relations with Saudi Arabia would be a “blessing” – to a United Nations’ hall without a Saudi delegation.
     
            Amid jeers, many delegates left the General Assembly Hall as Netanyahu took the stage.
     
            “To truly realize the blessing of a new Middle East, we must continue the path we paved with the Abraham Accords four years ago,” Netanyahu said.
     
            “Above all, this means achieving a historic peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia.”
     
            Prior to Hamas’ October 7 attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia had been secretly discussing establishing normal diplomatic relations.
     
            Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman – also known as MBS – reiterated earlier this month that the Kingdom will not forge diplomatic ties with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is established with East Jerusalem as its capital.
     
            Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea of any Palestinian state.
     
            Peace with Saudi Arabia, he said on Friday “would be a true pivot of history.”
     
            “It would usher in a historic reconciliation between the Arab world and Israel, between Islam and Judaism, between Mecca and Jerusalem.”
     
            At least two people have been injured as Israeli airstrikes inside Lebanon continued on Friday afternoon, Lebanese state news agency NNA reported.
     
            According to NNA, the pair was injured when Israel hit a building in Ghazieh, near the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon.
     
            Authorities have yet to report any other casualties, but Israeli airstrikes were reported across the country. Also in the south, NNA reported several strikes in the coastal Tyre district.
     
            The Lebanese minister of health, Dr. Firass Abiad, said earlier that 25 people have been killed in the country since midnight local time.
     
Remember: Israel has focused most of its offensive in southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is strongest, but it also carried out two airstrikes in the Harbata plain, in the Baalbek district, in the northern part of Lebanon.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday decried the desire by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, alongside several Hamas leaders.
     
            “Ladies and gentlemen, the real war criminals are not in Israel,” he told the UN General Assembly.
     
            “They’re in Iran. They’re in Gaza, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen. Those of you who stand with these criminals, those of you who stand with evil against good, with the curse against the blessing, those of you who do so should be ashamed of yourselves.”
     
            The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.
     
            “Given the antisemitism at the UN, it should surprise no one that the prosecutor at the ICC, one of the UN’s affiliate organs, is considering issuing arrest warrants against me and Israel’s defense minister – the democratically elected leaders of the democratic state of Israel,” Netanyahu said.
     
            “Nobody is above the law,” ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN this spring.
     
            But “the ICC prosecutors rushed to judgement,” Netanyahu said. “His refusal to treat Israel with its independent courts, the way other democracies are treated, is hard to explain by anything other than pure antisemitism,” he added.
     
            Israel has “no choice” but to fight back against Hezbollah, so long as the militant group threatens Israel from its base in Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.
     
            “As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right, to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely,” the Israeli leader said. “And that’s exactly what we’re doing.”
     
            Around 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah attacks that began on October 8, the day after Hamas’ attack on Israel.
     
            The Israeli military has in recent days rapidly escalated its fight against Hezbollah, killed hundreds in Lebanon and forced hundreds of thousands of civilians from their homes in southern Lebanon, according to the government there.
     
            “We will continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met,” Netanyahu added.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country’s military has killed or captured more than half of Hamas’ 40,000 fighters during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.
     
            The leader also claimed that Israel’s military had destroyed 90% of Hamas’ rocket arsenal and eliminated “key segments” of the militants’ tunnel network over the course of its nearly one-year war against the group.
     
            Netanyahu said Israel was “now focused on mopping up Hamas’s remaining fighting capabilities,” including targeting remaining senior commanders and destroying remaining infrastructure.
     
            Also during his speech, Netanyahu praised Israel’s soldiers for their role in the Israel-Gaza war – which has killed 41,945 people and injured 96,006 in the enclave, according to authorities there – saying they had “fought back with incredible courage and with heroic sacrifice.”
     
            “And I have another message for this assembly and for the world outside this hall: We are winning!” he said.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered little detail during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on who might govern Gaza after the war there concludes.
     
            “Israel will reject any role for Hamas in a post-war Gaza,” he said.
     
            “We don’t seek to resettle Gaza, we seek to demilitarize and deradicalize Gaza. Only then can we ensure that this round of fighting will be the last round of fighting.
     
            Israel, he said, was “ready to work with regional and local partners to support a civilian administration in Gaza committed to peaceful coexistence.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought props to his speech at the UN General Assembly to make his case.
     
            Holding two maps, he said the world much choose between a “blessing” and a “curse.”
     
            At the center of the choice was Israel’s major regional enemy: Iran.
     
            The blessing, he said, “shows Israel and its Arab partners forming a land bridge connecting Asia and Europe.”
     
            “Now look at this second map,” he said. “It’s a map of a curse. It’s a map of an arc of terror that Iran has created and imposed from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean.”
     
        “Which of these two maps that I showed you will shape our future? Will it be the blessings of peace and prosperity for Israel, our Arab partners, and the rest of the world? Or will it be the curse in which Iran and its proxies spread carnage and chaos everywhere?”
     
 
            He added: “There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach – that’s true for the whole of the Middle East.”
     
            As has previously been the case when Netanyahu uses maps, his map did not identify the West Bank or Gaza, but rather identified all that territory as Israel.
     
            As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stage in the United Nations General Assembly hall, a large number of delegates could be seen leaving the hall.
     
            Jeers could be heard as Netanyahu took the stage.
     
            “I decided to come here and set the record straight,” Netanyahu said in his opening remarks, saying he wanted to defend against the “lies and slander” he’d heard.
     
            The Lebanese minister of health, Dr. Firass Abiad, said 25 people have been killed in the country since midnight local time as Israel continued its strikes on Hezbollah targets.
     
            “Since midnight until now, there have been 25 martyrs and a large number of injured. A statement with the full casualty numbers will be released either today or tomorrow morning,” Abiad told a Friday news conference.
     
            Tens of thousands of people have been displaced following a flare-up in hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Abiad said the health ministry was working to help deliver medicine and baby formula, and the health services had also helped with more than 12 childbirths among those displaced.
     
            The Israeli military plans to increase its efforts to hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Friday.
     
            “We’ve been hitting Hezbollah very hard over the year, and especially in recent weeks - we will continue increasing this effort,” Gallant said during a visit to the northern Israeli town of Safed.
     
            “We intend to bring about security to the communities in the north, and return those who left to their homes safely.”
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday it had struck additional targets following a first wave of strikes. They included the launcher used by Hezbollah that fired towards the northern city of Tiberias earlier Friday.
     
            The IDF said aircraft had struck the launchers used to fire the rockets from the area of Haddatha in Lebanon, as well as dozens more launchers, “weapons storage facilities, and terrorist infrastructure sites” in the areas of Sidon, Nabatieh and elsewhere.
     
            Strikes were ongoing, the IDF said.
     
Remember: Intense Israeli airstrikes have been targeting militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Monday saw the deadliest day for the country in two decades, when Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others.
     
            Last Friday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of one of its senior military commanders who was killed in a strike on a residential building in a southern suburb of Beirut.
     
            When pagers exploded across Lebanon last week, the year-long war with Hezbollah was not at the top of the Israeli political agenda.
     
            Instead, the political class was convulsed with speculation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replace him with a military neophyte, Gideon Sa’ar, to shore up his domestic power. National security heavyweights were scathing. “It’ll take him months on end to train for the job,” said Gadi Eisenkot, a highly respected former Israeli military chief and member of the opposition.
     
            The pager and subsequent walkie-talkie explosions – which together killed dozens, maimed thousands, and rattled Lebanese nerves – put paid to that scheme, for now. The suddenly heightened tensions with Hezbollah gave Gallant a lifeline. Reports in the Israeli press suggest that the stay on Gallant’s dismissal is only temporary, and that Netanyahu still intends to fire him.
     
            Policy and domestic politics are impossible to separate in any democracy, but especially in Netanyahu’s Israel – and especially now.

            The manager of a Palestinian aid group has been shot and killed in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, in an apparent case of mistaken identity.
     
            Islam Hijazy, the Gaza program manager of HEAL Palestine, was shot Friday while driving through the city. She leaves behind a husband and two small children.
     
            According to eyewitnesses and local journalists from Khan Younis, a group of armed men killed Hijazy. They said that the gunmen, who were in several cars, stopped her jeep and shot her multiple times. The identity of the attackers is unknown.
     
            However, her husband – Moumen Al-Farram – told CNN: “Initially, it seems to have been an accidental killing due to mistaken identity. Members of the security forces opened fire on my wife’s jeep, which she was driving.”
     
            “The security forces were pursuing a person driving a jeep similar to the one my wife was in.”
     
            A family statement said that they were delaying Hijazy’s burial until local authorities issued a statement explaining what happened.
     
            The Gaza Interior Ministry is expected to issue a statement on the attack later Friday.
     
            Insecurity in Gaza, and the presence of many heavily armed groups, has made humanitarian work in the enclave increasingly difficult since last October. While Hamas has run Gaza since 2006, the last 11 months of conflict have reduced its ability to enforce security, and there has been an upsurge in criminal gangs.
     
            The Israeli military says it has struck more Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon as cross-border attacks resumed Friday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says dozens of targets in southern Lebanon were struck, and the launcher that fired rockets towards Haifa early Friday was destroyed.
     
            “In dozens of additional strikes, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) struck terrorist infrastructure sites and terrorist cells” belonging to Hezbollah in several areas, the IDF said.
     
            Lebanon’s National News Agency reported there had been casualties in an Israeli airstrike on the house of the mayor of Aytit in southern Lebanon.
     
            The IDF added that following the sirens that sounded in the Lower Galilee area, approximately 10 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. The majority were intercepted.
     
            For its part, Hezbollah announced Friday that it had fired Fad-1 rockets towards the Ilaniya settlement and had also targeted the city of Tiberias in northern Israel.
     
Some context: Israel has been launching a barrage of airstrikes across swathes of Lebanon as its conflict with Hezbollah escalates.
     
            Israel’s military has vowed to speed up its “offensive operations” against Hezbollah without reprieve. Troops on Wednesday held exercises simulating ground combat in Lebanon, which the military has not ruled out.
     
            Thousands of people in Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes amid the intense attacks.
     
            Israel said Thursday that a further $8.7 billion in military aid is being disbursed by the United States government to “support Israel’s ongoing military efforts,” its defense ministry announced.
     
            Nearly half of the aid – which was approved by Congress earlier in the year – will be used to fund immediate needs, described by the ministry as “critical acquisitions.”
     
            It also includes an additional $5.2 billion in the form of a grant intended to enhance Israel’s air defense systems, including strengthening its Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile interceptors, while supporting the “continued development of an advanced high-powered laser defense system currently in its later stages of development,” the ministry said.
     
            Both systems have been pivotal to Israel’s defense in recent weeks against increasing rocket attacks from Hezbollah. Earlier this week, Israel’s David’s Sling intercepted over the Tel Aviv area a surface-to-surface missile fired from Lebanon.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Pentagon.
     
            The announcement of further aid comes as the US, France and several allies call for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border, in a proposal intended to de-escalate the situation and allow residents in both countries along the border to return to their homes.
     
            Israel has been the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since its founding, most of which has been military assistance, but the aid has been the subject of frequent debate in the US, with pro-Palestinian activists and some lawmakers calling for conditions to ensure it complies with humanitarian law and US policy goals.
     
            One person was killed and several others injured in an Israeli airstrike on tents in the compound of a hospital in central Gaza on Friday.
     
            CNN video from the scene at the Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in Deir al-Balah, identified remnants of a US-made Hellfire missile at the scene.
     
            The individual killed was identified as a 41-year-old man.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that overnight the Israeli air force conducted “a precise strike on Islamic Jihad terrorists who were operating inside command-and-control centers embedded within the Humanitarian Area in Deir Al Balah.”
     
            ‏”Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians,” the IDF added.
     
        One man at the hospital said the tents were sheltering many displaced families. The man, who did not give his name, told CNN: “These displaced people were sleeping and were attacked by Israeli war jets without doing any crime. We want the world to see what happened to these displaced people.”
     
 
            Umm Ali, a woman taking shelter at the compound with her children, said the strike was at 2:30 a.m. “We wake up tired and sleep tired, We have had enough. We want calm.”
     
            Ali added that “all our tents are destroyed, they said to go south for security, we came here and there is no security.”
     
            CNN has asked the IDF for information on the target of the strike.
     
            Lebanon’s minister of social affairs, Hector Hajjar, says that the poorest families displaced by the conflict in the south of the country will soon begin to receive cash payments for essentials.
     
            Hajjar said China had provided $1 million, which will be distributed to 10,000 families, while $3 million in assistance was coming from European nations, Canada and others. In addition, the World Food Programme (WFP) has contributed $2.3 million.
     
            Hajjar said efforts were being made to overcome shortages in shelter supplies and food.
     
            The grants being provided – which Hajjar said will take two weeks to be distributed – are a limited beginning, as Lebanon’s health minister, Dr. Firass Abiad, told CNN on Thursday that he estimates there are likely 400,000 to 500,000 internally displaced people.
     
            Abiad said authorities know how many people have been internally displaced to official shelters but “multitudes” more were being provided shelter by relatives, friends or strangers.
     
Humanitarian warnings: Humanitarian needs are growing as the conflict between Israel and Lebanon escalates, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned in a statement.
     
            “Many are traumatized from losing homes and loved ones, including MSF’s own staff,” the statement said. “In addition to medical support, people are in need of basic supplies like mattresses and hygiene products as the shelters and schools currently housing them were not prepared to accommodate so many people.”
     
            Two more senior Hezbollah operatives were killed in an Israeli strike on southern Beirut earlier this week, the Israeli military said Friday, after earlier announcing the attack killed one of the group’s top commanders.
     
            The strike Tuesday that killed Hezbollah’s missile and rocket force chief Ibrahim Qubaisi also killed his deputy, Abbas Ibrahim Sharaf Ad-Din, and another senior operative from the missile unit, Hussein Hany, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.
     
            Hezbollah confirmed Qubaisi was killed in an airstrike following the Israeli military’s initial announcement on Tuesday.
     
            In its statement Friday, the IDF also said a senior Hezbollah operative from the group’s surface-to-surface missile unit, Fuad Shafiq Khaz’al Khanafer, had been killed in a separate strike, without specifying on which day.
     
Remember: Israel has claimed it killed a number of senior Hezbollah figures in recent days during strikes on Lebanon. On Thursday, Israel’s military said it carried out “precise strikes” in Beirut that killed Hezbollah’s aerial command chief, Muhammad Hussein Srour.
     
            Hezbollah on Friday confirmed Srour’s death, but did not specify the circumstances.
     
            The Israeli military said Friday it detected about 10 projectiles fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel’s largest city, Haifa, and nearby communities.
     
            Some of the projectiles were intercepted while others were “identified as having fallen in open areas,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.
     
            No damage was reported, though shrapnel from an interception landed in an open area near the town of Kfar Hasidim, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Haifa, an Israeli police spokesperson said.
     
            Police in the area were scanning for damage, the spokesperson added.
     
            In a statement, Hezbollah said it launched strikes on a settlement in the Haifa area with Fadi-1 rockets in response to recent Israeli attacks, in support of Palestinians in Gaza and in defense of Lebanon.
     
            Israel said it is considering a US-led ceasefire proposal that would see a 21-day pause in fighting in Lebanon, as fears rise of a fully-fledged war between Israel and Hezbollah that risks escalating into a wider regional conflict.
     
            While top US officials initially suggested the proposal was a done deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later threw cold water on the plan, saying any reports of an imminent ceasefire were “incorrect.”
     
            Netanyahu’s office clarified in a statement that it is discussing the ceasefire proposal and “shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes.”
     
            Meanwhile, Lebanon’s foreign minister warned the crisis in the country “threatens the entire Middle East” and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire “on all fronts.”
     
Here’s what we know about the ceasefire initiative:
 
            • Proposed by US and allies: The proposal comes amid deadly fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that many fear could spill into a wider conflict. Hoping to prevent such an outcome, diplomats and leaders in New York for the United Nations General Assembly hurriedly worked to secure a plan that would pause the fighting and allow room for diplomacy to take hold.
     
            • Which countries were involved?: President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
     
            • Has Hezbollah agreed?: Hezbollah has not yet commented on the proposed deal, and Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has denied reports of signing the framework for Lebanon. Media reports claimed earlier that Mikati signed a ceasefire proposal after meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and envoy Amos Hochstein on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
     
            • Fighting continues: Netanyahu, who is expected to speak Friday at the UN General Assembly, said Israel’s military will continue fighting Hezbollah with “full force” after days of strikes on Lebanon that have killed hundreds and which Lebanon’s health minister said have displaced up to half a million people.
     
            Israel carried out part of its device attack targeting Hezbollah by concealing explosives inside the batteries of pagers brought into Lebanon, according to two high-ranking Lebanese security officials, who said the technology was so advanced that it was virtually undetectable.
     
            Lebanese security officials watched a series of controlled explosions of some of the weaponized pagers, as investigations into who manufactured the wireless communication devices and how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets continued.
     
            The pagers used in the controlled explosions were switched off at the time of the attack on September 17, which meant they did not receive the message that caused the compromised devices to detonate. The officials had a front-row seat to see just how catastrophic the blasts would have been to those carrying the devices and others around them.
     
            Thousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members last week, targeting their pagers on Tuesday, and then walkie-talkies a day later. In all, the blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders. The attack blindsided the group, which had opted for analogue technologies after forgoing cell phones to avoid Israeli infiltration.
     
            Israel has not commented directly on the attacks, but CNN has learned that the explosions were the result of a joint operation by Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, tacitly acknowledged his country’s role the day after the pager attack, praising “excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad.” Both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks.
     
Read the full investigation.
 
            Israel is discussing the US-led ceasefire initiative and “how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement Thursday.
     
            The statement said it was “important to clarify a few points” due to “misreporting on the US-led ceasefire initiative.”
     
            “Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes,” the statement read. “Israel appreciates the US efforts in this regard because the US role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region.”
     
            Israel and the US met to discuss the ceasefire proposal on Thursday and “will continue those discussions in the coming days,” the statement read.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the importance of a temporary ceasefire agreement in his meeting with Israeli strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday.
     
            The two also spoke about efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, according to a State Department readout.
     
            The Israeli Prime Minister’s office said the teams had met “to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes” in a statement released following their meeting Thursday.
     
            “We will continue those discussions in the coming days,” the statement said.
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed one of its commanders, Muhammad Hussein Srour, was killed on Thursday, but did not elaborate on the circumstances around his death.
     
            Hezbollah said Srour was killed “on the road to Jerusalem,” in reference to those who are fighting to support people in Gaza, the group said in a statement released shortly after midnight on Friday local time.
     
            Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said its strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs killed Srour, who, it said, was the head of Hezbollah’s Aerial Command. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the “assassination operation” during his flight to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, according to his office.

            • Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to speak Friday at the UN General Assembly after his office said it “shares the aims” of a US-led plan calling for a 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border, as part of a diplomatic push to prevent a regional war from erupting.
     
            • As Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah trade fresh strikes, Lebanon’s foreign minister warned the crisis “threatens the entire Middle East” and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire.
     
            • Lebanon has recorded more than 100,000 people displaced by the recent conflict, but authorities said the true number is likely much higher. Up to half a million people are likely internally displaced, Lebanon’s health minister told CNN.
     
            • Hezbollah confirmed the death of a senior commander, but did not specify the circumstances, after Israel’s military said it carried out “precise strikes” in Beirut that killed the head of the group’s aerial command.
     
Our live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
 
            Israel said it is considering a US-led ceasefire proposal that would see a 21-day pause in fighting in Lebanon as fears rise of a fully-fledged war between Israel and Hezbollah that risks escalating into a wider regional conflict.
     
            While top US officials initially suggested the proposal was a done deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later threw cold water on the plan, saying any reports of an imminent ceasefire were “incorrect.”
     
            Netanyahu’s office clarified in a statement that it is discussing the ceasefire proposal and “shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes.”
     
            Meanwhile, Lebanon’s foreign minister warned the crisis in the country “threatens the entire Middle East” and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire “on all fronts.”
     
Here’s what we know about the ceasefire initiative:
 
            • Proposed by US and allies: The proposal comes amid deadly fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that many fear could spill into a wider conflict. Hoping to prevent such an outcome, diplomats and leaders in New York for the United Nations General Assembly hurriedly worked to secure a plan that would pause the fighting and allow room for diplomacy to take hold.
     
            • Which countries were involved?: President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
     
            • Has Hezbollah agreed?: Hezbollah has not yet commented on the proposed deal, and Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has denied reports of signing the framework for Lebanon. Media reports claimed earlier that Mikati signed a ceasefire proposal after meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and envoy Amos Hochstein on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
     
            • Fighting rages: Netanyahu, who is expected to speak Friday at the UN General Assembly, said Israel’s military will continue fighting Hezbollah with “full force” after days of strikes on Lebanon that have killed hundreds and which Lebanon’s health minister said have displaced up to half a million people.
     
            Israel carried out part of its device attack targeting Hezbollah by concealing explosives inside the batteries of pagers brought into Lebanon, according to two high-ranking Lebanese security officials, who said the technology was so advanced that it was virtually undetectable.
     
            Lebanese security officials watched a series of controlled explosions of some of the weaponized pagers, as investigations into who manufactured the wireless communication devices and how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets continued.
     
            The pagers used in the controlled explosions were switched off at the time of the attack on September 17, which meant they did not receive the message that caused the compromised devices to detonate. The officials had a front-row seat to see just how catastrophic the blasts would have been to those carrying the devices and others around them.
     
            Thousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members last week, targeting their pagers on Tuesday, and then walkie-talkies a day later. In all, the blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders. The attack blindsided the group, which had opted for analogue technologies after forgoing cell phones to avoid Israeli infiltration.
     
            Israel has not commented directly on the attacks, but CNN has learned that the explosions were the result of a joint operation by Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, tacitly acknowledged his country’s role the day after the pager attack, praising “excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad.” Both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks.

            Lebanon’s foreign minister on Thursday warned the crisis with Israel “threatens the entire Middle East” and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire “on all fronts.”
     
            “Lebanon is currently enduring a crisis, which is threatening its very existence,” Abdallah Bou Habib said while addressing the United Nations General Assembly.
     
        “The situation requires international intervention on an urgent basis before the situation spirals out of control with a domino effect, making this crisis impossible to contain,” the foreign minister said, warning the current conflict could “transform into a black hole that will engulf regional, international peace and security.”
     
 
            “The crisis in Lebanon threatens the entire Middle East with the worst, if the situation remains as it currently is, and if the world remains immobile,” he said.
     
            “We wish today to reiterate our call for a ceasefire on all fronts,” he said, expressing support for the efforts by the United States, France and several allies to move toward an agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            He went on to assert that the underlying cause of the instability in the region came from the lack of a permanent solution to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.
     
            “To claim anything else would be a loss of time,” Habib said.
     
            Israel is discussing the US-led ceasefire initiative and “how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement Thursday.
     
            The statement said it was “important to clarify a few points” due to “misreporting on the US-led ceasefire initiative.”
     
        “Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes,” the statement read. “Israel appreciates the US efforts in this regard because the US role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region.”
     
 
            Israel and the US met to discuss the ceasefire proposal on Thursday and “will continue those discussions in the coming days,” the statement read.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the importance of a temporary ceasefire agreement in his meeting with Israeli strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday.
     
            The two also spoke about efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, according to a State Department readout.
     
            The Israeli Prime Minister’s office said the teams had met “to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes” in a statement released following their meeting Thursday.
     
            “We will continue those discussions in the coming days,” the statement said.
     
            Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the past four days have displaced about 140,000 children “with many arriving at shelters showing signs of severe distress,” Save the Children, a humanitiarian organization, said in a statement on Thursday.
     
        “Over 400,000 people have been displaced since the start of Israeli airstrikes on Sunday in the latest escalation in cross-border violence, with numbers expected to increase in the coming days,” the statement added.
     
 
            Dr Firass Abiad, Lebanon’s health minister, told CNN earlier on Thursday that he estimates there are likely 400,000 to 500,000 internally displaced people, much higher than officially recorded figures. He said authorities only know how many people have been internally displaced to official shelters but there are “multitudes” that have also fled to stay with relatives, friends or the homes of strangers who have offered them accommodation.
     
            Save the Children staff expressed concern over the psychological impact of the conflict on children, “many of whom are showing signs of severe distress due to the displacement and constant shelling,” according to the statement.
     
            The humanitarian group also expressed concerns about the closure of many schools across Lebanon, saying it has impacted “all of the country’s 1.5 million children, with Lebanon’s already critical mental health crisis worsening as the hostilities continue to escalate,” the statement said.
     
        “Children are telling us that danger is everywhere, and they can never be safe. Every loud sound makes them jump now. Many children’s lives, rights, and futures have already been turned upside down and now their capacity to cope with this escalating crisis has been eroded.”
     
        Jennifer Moorehead, Save the Children’s Country Director in Lebanon.
     
            Lebanon has recorded nearly 109,000 people displaced by the recent conflict, but authorities said the actual number is likely much higher.
     
            The official figure reported by the country’s disaster risk management unit Thursday includes at least 31,730 Lebanese and Syrians who have already fled across the border into Syria.
     
            In a statement, the agency said many displaced people not represented in the official figure had moved to their homes in other areas, to stay with relatives, or to rented rooms or hotels.
     
            Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad on Thursday told CNN he estimates there are likely 400,000 to 500,000 internally displaced people. Abiad said authorities know how many people have been internally displaced to official shelters but “multitudes” more were being provided shelter by relatives, friends or strangers.
     
            Humanitarian needs are growing as the conflict between Israel and Lebanon escalates, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned in a statement.
     
            “Many are traumatized from losing homes and loved ones, including MSF’s own staff,” the statement said. “In addition to medical support, people are in need of basic supplies like mattresses and hygiene products as the shelters and schools currently housing them were not prepared to accommodate so many people.”
     
            Maram Sukkariyeh, a health promotion supervisor with MSF, described days of strikes in northern areas of Lebanon’s Beqaa region.
     
        “On Monday morning at 6:30 a.m. we woke up to powerful strikes on mountains and valleys, shelling villages from Baalbek to Hermel,” Sukkariyeh said. “All we could hear was the sound of ambulance sirens. We saw smoke with each strike, and the bombs were hitting very close to houses.”
     
 
            Sukkariyeh said people who fled their homes were “scared and worried.”
     
        “No one knows where to seek safety. With every strike, people are losing their lives, including children,” Sukkariyeh said. “The future is unknown and deciding what to do is very difficult. Everyone seeks safety for their families and children.”
     
 
            Senior US officials were practically triumphant Wednesday night: The United States and a large number of its allies had nailed down a proposal after days of feverish talks that would put in place a ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            In a hastily arranged call with reporters just moments after the release of a joint statement, top administration officials hailed the framework as “an important breakthrough.” The 21-day pause in fighting that the nations were proposing would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Those officials were clear: The question was not if Israel and Hezbollah would accept the ceasefire proposal, but precisely when. Both Israel and Hezbollah were “familiar with the text,” one official said, and the US felt comfortable going public with the framework, with the understanding that both sides were ready to sign on.
     
            But only hours later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would throw cold water on the multi-national proposal. First, the prime minister’s office released a statement saying any reports of an imminent ceasefire were “incorrect” and that the Israel Defense Forces would continue fighting with “full force.”
     
            Then, the prime minister himself told the press as he got off his plane in New York City:
     
        “My policy, our policy, is clear: We continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might. We will not stop until we achieve all our goals.”
     
 
            Some 24 hours after the White House’s announcement of the ceasefire proposal, there has still been no indication that Israel and Hezbollah are ready to agree to it. Israel’s initial response was clearly not the reaction the White House had anticipated, and it raised immediate question of why, if Israel was on board with the proposal, its leader appeared so eager to dismiss it.
     
            Netanyahu’s apparent reversal amounted to a major disappointment, but for some officials it also underscored a reality that has existed for months: Netanyahu’s willingness to break publicly and openly with Biden, particularly when he faces internal political opposition in Israel.

            The Israeli military has intercepted a surface-to-surface missile fired from Yemen, using the Arrow Aerial Defense System, it said in a statement in the early hours of Friday morning local time.
     
            “Sirens and explosions were heard following the interception and falling shrapnel,” the statement read.
     
            Nic Robertson, CNN’s international diplomatic editor in Tel Aviv, heard sirens across the city but did not hear or see an interception.
     
            A spokesperson for Israel Airports Authority told CNN on Friday that Ben Gurion Airport is operating as usual following the red alert sirens.
     
            Yemen’s Houthis have said they will release an “important statement” soon.
     
            The Israeli military said it struck about 220 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon throughout Thursday, with targets including the group’s infrastructure sites, launchers and weapon storage facilities.
     
            The statement comes amid another wave of exchanges across the Israel-Lebanon border between the Israel Defense Forces and the Iran-backed militant group. According to the IDF, Hezbollah fired more than 150 projectiles today, triggering sirens in Israel. Hezbollah confirmed it carried out several attacks in northern Israel with rockets and drones.
     
            At least 92 people have been killed in Israeli strikes across Lebanon in the past 24 hours, according to several statements from Lebanon’s health ministry, sharing casualty figures by region.
     
            The ministry also said at least 153 other people have been wounded across the country.
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed one of its commanders, Muhammad Hussein Srour, was killed on Thursday, but did not elaborate on the circumstances around his death..
     
            Hezbollah said Srour was killed “on the road to Jerusalem,” in reference to those who are fighting to support people in Gaza, the group said in a statement released shortly after midnight on Friday local time.
     
            Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said its strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs killed Srour, who, it said, was the head of Hezbollah’s Aerial Command. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the “assassination operation” during his flight to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, according to his office.
     
            Neither Israeli Strategic Minister Ron Dermer nor Ambassador Michael Herzog answered when asked directly by CNN Thursday if they are going to accept the ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Instead, both Israeli officials just slightly chuckled. Dermer made a quip that “less is more” when speaking as a diplomat. He claimed that the day of meetings was just getting started since he flew over on Wednesday.
     
            The two arrived for their meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken just before 5 p.m. — four hours after it was scheduled.
     
            The US is engaged in a diplomatic “full court press” to try to get the Israelis and Hezbollah to accept the 21-day ceasefire unveiled on Wednesday night.
     
            This comes as the Biden administration insisted Thursday that there is still a diplomatic path for a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah fired barrages of rockets toward Israel on Thursday, as the Israeli military continued its bombing campaign in Lebanon with fresh strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut and on infrastructure on the Lebanon-Syrian border.
     
            More than 150 projectiles were launched toward Israel on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said, causing sirens to sound across northern Israel through the day.
     
            Hezbollah claimed on Thursday to have carried out several attacks on various areas in northern Israel with dozens of rockets and drones, according to several statements released by group.
     
            In one statement, Hezbollah said it fired 50 rockets on Ahihud in northern Israel, saying it was “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, in support of their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its people.”
     
            The group also said it had fired at Kiryat Ata, a city in northern Israel, with 50 rockets; the northern city of Kiryat Shmona; a northern military base; and two Israeli warplanes that it said were attempting to cross into Lebanese territory.
     
            On Thursday evening local time, Israeli police reported that debris from projectiles and interceptors had fallen in the Safed and Rosh Pina areas. No one was hurt, but there was “heavy damage” to property, and Israel’s fire and rescue service said it was fighting fires caused by the falls.
     
            A 45-year-old man was being treated by medics after he was struck by shrapnel in the Galilee area, according to Israel’s national emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA).
     
            In Lebanon, at least 60 people have been killed and 81 wounded in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours, according to a report released by the country’s Disaster Risk Management Unit on Thursday.
     
            The family of an Israeli hostage held in Gaza, Nimrod Cohen, is visiting New York this week to protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he is scheduled to speak at the United Nations General Assembly. The Cohens criticize him for pivoting attention to Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying the leader should instead be focused on a hostage and ceasefire deal.
     
            “We need to talk about the hostages and we need to keep the subject alive so we don’t forget them,” Nimrod’s sister Romi Cohen said.
     
            The family criticized Netanyahu for not making the primary goal of his government to bring back the hostages still held in Gaza as fighting moves north to the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            “Vengeance,” his brother Yotam Cohen said, “was the first goal of the war.”
     
            “Now it’s Lebanon, and there is no deal,” his mother Viki Cohen said. “The first priority that the government says is to destroy Hamas. The other priority was to bring back the hostages, but this was not the main goal.”
     
            Viki Cohen and her husband Yehuda also spoke at the protest near the UN, accusing Netanyahu of continuing the war to stay in power.
     
        “He actually is ruling on the blood of Israeli civilians, Israeli soldiers and Israeli hostages,” Yehuda Cohen said.
     
 
            “I want my son alive,” he told CNN. “I want him to get back his life. I want him to be free.”
     
            Zahiro Shahar Mor, the nephew of killed Israeli hostage Avraham Munder, also warned against a conflict in Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza “was a mistake from day one,” he said. “Don’t deepen the mistake. Stop the war immediately.”
     
            Eran Etzion, the former deputy national security adviser and head of policy planning in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel, was at the protest as well.
     
            He said he flew to New York “to voice the majority of Israelis who are interested in an immediate hostage deal and a ceasefire agreement.”
     
            Netanyahu, he said, is a “rogue prime minister who is acting against the national interest of our country, against the expressed will and interests of the vast majority of Israelis.”
     
            More than 40 health care workers have been killed in “targeted attacks” this week, according to Lebanese Health Minister Dr. Firass Abiad.
     
            Ambulances are “being directly targeted as they are doing their job,” he said, stressing ambulances should be protected by international law.
     
            For the time being, the country’s health care system — weakened by multiple crises in recent years — is “holding,” but health care workers are facing extreme challenges, he said. “We have surgeons who have been operating almost nonstop for 48 hours or more,” according to Abiad.
     
            Supplies of some medications are running low, he warned.
     
        “I am extremely worried that we are working almost at full capacity and that the whole system is almost at the brink,” he told CNN.
     
 
            The Lebanese health minister has described the situation in his country as “a full-fledged war” after a week of escalating fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and a climbing civilian death toll in Lebanon.
     
        “Irrespective of what you want to call it, we have civilians, innocent people, women and children being indiscriminately attacked, targeted. We have residential buildings being blown to smithereens, we have hospitals, ambulances primary health care centers being targeted,” Dr. Firass Abiad told CNN in Beirut.
     
 
            The attacks are taking their “main toll on innocent civilians, on women, on children and clearly the intent is to create an environment of terror,” he said, adding that it has led to a mass exodus of people from their homes.
     
            Authorities know how many people have been internally displaced to official shelters, but there are “multitudes” that have also fled to stay with relatives, friends, or the homes of strangers who have offered them accommodation.
     
        “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of internally displaced, probably close to … 400,000 or maybe even 500,000,” he said.
     
 
            Abiad called on the international community to exert more pressure on Israel to accept a proposed ceasefire agreement that has been floated by the US and its allies this week, which he said Lebanon had accepted.
     
            “Unfortunately, it seems that everyone is intent on finding a diplomatic solution to this conflict except one party that wants to continue with its indiscriminate attacks on civilians,” he said, laying the blame on Israel for the failure to find a diplomatic solution so far.
     
            Hezbollah has made its position clear that with a ceasefire in Gaza, it will cease its attacks on Israel, Abiad said, adding that the US could be doing more to pressure Israel into a ceasefire.
     
            Israeli Air Force chief Tomer Bar told soldiers on Thursday that the force is preparing alongside the army for a ground invasion into Lebanon to fight Hezbollah in case an order is issued.
     
        “We are preparing shoulder to shoulder with the Northern Command for the entry of a ground maneuver. We are preparing; whether it will be carried out is a decision above us,” he said. “This is our opportunity to weaken them, taking them out from the air and from the ground in an organized manner.”
     
 
            Bar also said that the military aimed as a “top priority” to prevent weapon transfers from Iran to the Iran-backed militant group.
     
            “The confidence of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah, Hezbollah, and their ability to recover from what happened to it a number of days ago depends on the pipeline coming in from Iran,” he said.
     
            Israel’s deadly strikes on Lebanon and last week’s pager and walkie-talkie explosions have killed Hezbollah figures, including elite commander Ibrahim Aqil.
     
            The White House was unable to explain the apparent disconnect between a call from the US and its allies for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu —  who has cast news of any imminent ceasefire as “incorrect” — but repeatedly stressed that Wednesday’s ceasefire statement was “coordinated” with Israel.
     
            “The statement was indeed coordinated with the Israeli side,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in response to a question from CNN.
     
            Discussions between the negotiating parties in New York, Jean-Pierre said, are “ongoing” and “coordinated with the Israeli side,” later adding that there could be “more to share later in the day.”
     
            Pressed again on Netanyahu’s comments, Jean-Pierre referred inquiries to the prime minister’s office but did not offer more explanation.
     
        “What we’re trying to do this is a clear call for a temporary ceasefire. We want to provide space,” she said, adding, “The statement was indeed coordinated with the Israeli side. I can’t speak for them. They will have to speak for themselves. I’m just laying out what we know, how this came together and … what our end goal is.”
     
 
            Israel has exhausted all diplomatic options with Hezbollah, the chairman of Israel’s opposition National Unity Party Benny Gantz said Thursday.
     
            Israel “has exhausted every diplomatic opportunity possible to try stop Hezbollah’s onslaught targeting the people of northern Israel,” he told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a visit to Germany on Thursday.
     
Remember: One of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s most prominent political challengers, Gantz left the government in June when he resigned as war cabinet minister, after accusing Netanyahu of preventing the country from moving toward a “real victory” in Gaza.
     
            On Thursday, the centrist Gantz echoed the sentiments of Netanyahu’s right-wing Israeli government, saying the country was determined to dismantle Hezbollah’s capabilities.
     
            He also said Israel was ready to “hold the State of Lebanon accountable for terror originating from its territory and facilitate a sustainable agreement that will ultimately distance Hezbollah from the border with Israel.”
     
            Gantz’s comments come a day after Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told reporters at the UN that his country prefers a “diplomatic solution” in Lebanon to deal with the Iran-backed militant group, but that Israel would not hesitate to “use other methods to show to the other side that we mean business.”
     
            At least 1,540 people have been killed across Lebanon since hostilities erupted between Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah and Israel on October 8 last year, according to a report released by Lebanon’s Disaster Risk Management Unit on Thursday.
     
            At least 5,410 other people have been wounded since then, the report said.
     
            Among the victims, 60 people have been killed and 81 wounded in the past 24 hours, according to the report.
     
            The figures in the report did not distinguish between militants and civilians.
     
More context: Israel and Hezbollah have been trading deadly cross-border fire for months, forcing tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border to flee. Violence escalated over the past week in a series of Israeli surprise attacks and strikes.
     
            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin forcefully advocated for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called reports of an imminent ceasefire in Lebanon “incorrect.”
     
        “Let me be clear: Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path,” Austin said at a news conference in London. “Despite the sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable.”
     
 
            Austin’s comments come after the US and allies called for a 21-day ceasefire, and Netanyahu said that Israel will continue fighting “with full force.”
     
        “A diplomatic solution, not a military solution, is the only way to ensure that displaced civilians on both sides of the border can finally go back home,” Austin said.
     
 
            Austin also warned that “no one should try to exploit this crisis or expand this conflict” against US forces in the region.
     
            “Make no mistake, the United States remains postured to protect our forces and our personnel across the Middle East,” said Austin.
     
            He also said a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah would allow for time to continue working toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
     
            British Defense Secretary John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles echoed their support for the proposed 21-day ceasefire, with Healey saying that Israel has said it is “prepared to accept” the  proposal.
     
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the military has “additional missions to complete” in its fight against Hezbollah, as it presses on with intense strikes against the militant group.
     
            “We have additional missions to complete in order to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. We will continue throwing Hezbollah off balance and deepening their loss,” he said.
     
            Gallant’s remarks come as the US and allies have been urging for a ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border to prevent an all-out regional war from erupting.
     
            The defense minister said he met with top military officials on Thursday to “approve planned operations in the northern arena,” referring to the part of Israel close to the border with Lebanon.
     
            “We are continuing our sequence of operations: eliminating Hezbollah terrorists, dismantling Hezbollah’s offensive infrastructure, and destroying rockets and missiles,” Gallant said.
     
            Israel has been launching a barrage of airstrikes across swathes of Lebanon as its conflict with Hezbollah escalates.
     
            Israel’s military has vowed to speed up its “offensive operations” against Hezbollah without reprieve. Troops on Wednesday held exercises simulating ground combat in Lebanon, which the military has not ruled out.
     
            The Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told the United Nations General Assembly that the whole world is responsible for what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank.
     
        “Stop killing children and women, stop the genocide, stop sending weapons to Israel. This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people in Gaza and the West Bank,” Abbas said in his opening remarks.
     
 
            Abbas said Gaza is now unrecognizable and called for the international community to impose sanctions on Israel.
     
            “Seventy-five precent of everything in Gaza has been fully destroyed,” Abbas said.
     
            Abbas criticized the US for vetoing resolutions against Israel in the UN Security Council and for providing Israel with weapons that have been used to kill thousands of innocent civilians.
     
            He went on to say: “Israel does not deserve to be a member of the United Nations and says it has not fulfilled the conditions for membership to the UN.”
     
Remember: World leaders are in New York City for the 79th United Nations General Assembly to discuss global issues and highlight their countries’ priorities.
     
            Official speechmaking began on Tuesday morning, with the war in Gaza dominating attention.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to speak on Friday.
     
            The Israeli military claimed its strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday killed Hezbollah commander Muhammad Hussein Srour, who it said was the head of the group’s Aerial Command.
     
            Under “the direction of IDF intelligence, the IAF [Israeli Air Force] struck and eliminated the terrorist Muhammad Hussein Srour in Beirut,” the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
            The IDF alleged Srour was a longtime member of Hezbollah who had “promoted and executed several terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers using UAVs and explosive devices.”
     
            Netanyahu approved the “assassination operation” during his flight to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, the prime minister’s office said.
     
            There has been no comment from Hezbollah on the Israeli strikes or the Israeli military’s claim a commander was killed.
     
More on the strikes: At least two people were killed and 15 injured when Israeli warplanes struck a building in Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh, on Thursday afternoon, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said.
     
            One of those injured is a woman in a critical condition.
     
            CNN has geolocated the scene of the strike as Haret Hreik in Dahiyeh, a densely populated area with a strong Hezbollah presence.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has landed in New York, an Israeli official tells CNN, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly.
     
            Netanyahu had been set to fly on Wednesday and address the UN on Thursday but delayed his trip due to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            He is now expected to speak at the General Assembly on Friday.
     
            An Israeli official told CNN earlier that talks over a potential temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah are a main motivator for Netanyahu’s trip.

            Thousands of people in Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes amid the intense attacks.
     
            Details surrounding a possible ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel remain scant, but this is what we do know:
     
            •  Proposed by US and allies: The proposal comes amid deadly fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that many fear could spill into a wider conflict. Hoping to prevent such an outcome, diplomats and leaders in New York for the United Nations General Assembly spent the last 48 hours hurriedly working to secure a plan that would pause the fighting and allow room for diplomacy to take hold.
     
Which countries were involved?: President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
     
Has Hezbollah agreed?: Hezbollah has not yet commented on the proposed deal, and the Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has denied reports of signing the framework for Lebanon. Media reports claimed earlier that Mikati signed a ceasefire proposal after meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and envoy Amos Hochstein on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
     
Has Israel agreed?: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that media reports suggesting there could be an imminent ceasefire in Lebanon were “incorrect” and that he has told the Israeli military to continue fighting “with full force.” However, a source told CNN on Thursday morning that it was notable that Netanyahu has not denied reports that the US is pushing for a 21-day ceasefire.
     
            An Israeli airstrike killed at least fifteen people, including children and women, on Thursday in the Jabalia camp, according to the Gaza Civil Defense Authority.
     
            The Al-Faluja school has for many months been used as a shelter by displaced civilians. The Israel Defense Forces alleged that the school was being used as “a command and control center” by Hamas.
     
            The airstrike left dozens injured, Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN. Nine corpses from the strike arrived at the Kamal Adwan Hospital, the head of that facility, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, told CNN. All bodies received at the hospital were dismembered, he said.
     
            The IDF said that “prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.”
     
            Footage of the aftermath of the strike on the school, obtained by CNN, shows weapon remnants consistent with the tail actuation section of a US-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb (SDB), according to Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician.
     
For context: Despite the events unfolding in Lebanon, there has been no letup in airstrikes on Gaza. Hospitals in the besieged enclave are overwhelmed and under equipped, and the daily search for food and water remains desperate.
     
This post has been updated with information about the weapon remnants.
 
            There is no “formal mediation” between Hezbollah and Israel for a ceasefire in Lebanon, Qatar said a day after the United States and allies proposed a 21-day truce to de-escalate the conflict.
     
            Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari told a news conference in Doha that it’s still “too early” for talks between the warring parties.
     
            “I don’t think we can now say that there is a formal mediation track, rather that all channels of communication remain open,” he said.
     
            The Gulf Arab country was one of several US allies to endorse a framework for a Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire proposed by the US Wednesday.
     
        “We are optimistic about an international role … but the situation is quite dire on the ground and an escalation is happening at an unprecedented level,” Al Ansari said, adding that Qatar is hopeful that a push from the international community could stop the escalation.
     
 
            Senior US administration officials asserted that the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire proposal could “open up diplomatic space” and “galvanize” a stalled ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
     
            Al Ansari said that there is no “direct correlation” between talks on potential ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, and that the 21-day Lebanon truce was proposed by the US and its allies. Qatar, along with Egypt and the US, is mediating ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel.
     
            “There is a track now for Lebanon that is working more urgently, with several parties involved, with the aim of stopping the war immediately. And then there’s the track on Gaza,” he said.
     
            “However, that does not mean that there are tracks working (together) to reach de-escalation in both these case(s),” he added.
     
            It has been nine days since Hezbollah pagers exploded in Lebanon and Israel’s pivot to the north. That shift in military focus has yet to be felt in Gaza.
     
            More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during that time, according to numbers released by the health ministry in the enclave. This includes a couple and their young child in a Nuseirat school housing the displaced; a mother and her four children killed in their home while they slept; and 20-year-old twin men, killed as they read their phones on their front porch, along with two children playing near them in the street.
     
            It’s just a snapshot of just some of those killed by Israeli strikes this week while many have been distracted by events unfolding elsewhere. Israel says it takes measures to minimize civilian casualties as it targets Hamas hiding among civilians, but many of those killed have been women and children.
     
            There’s been no letup in airstrikes, hospitals are overwhelmed and under equipped, the daily search for food and water is desperate. One big difference is that the world’s attention is elsewhere.
     
        “Now the war in Beirut has started, we stopped seeing Gaza on the news,” says Hamdi al-Kurd, who was displaced from the north.“We lost all hope, there is no focus on Gaza, we’re barely mentioned.”
     
 
            Nabiha al-Shanar, also displaced from the north, adds: “Now no one is talking about the suffering of the Palestinian people, only the Lebanese people. They are our brothers, and we want a ceasefire for them but also for us.”
     
            Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has denied reports of having signed a ceasefire framework for Lebanon proposed by the United States and its allies.
     
            Media reports claimed earlier that Mikati signed a ceasefire proposal after meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Amos Hochstein on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.
     
            Mikati’s office said the prime minister clarified that he had welcomed the US statement on the framework proposal but its implementation should come through an “Israeli commitment” to international resolutions.
     
            Hezbollah hasn’t commented on the proposal or accepted it. Without the group’s backing, Mikati’s signing is unlikely to be effective.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Thursday denied reports of an imminent ceasefire and said Netanyahu has not responded to the proposal.
     
            Netanyahu also instructed the Israeli military to continue fighting in the north “with full force,”, the statement added.
     
            The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on Younine in northeastern Lebanon Wednesday night has risen to 23, the town’s mayor Ali Al-Kassas told CNN.
     
            The dead are all Syrians from one family, including women and children, he said, adding that they were day-laborers and their wives and children.
     
            The airstrike shortly before midnight local time hit a building near a gas station. Eight others were injured, including the Lebanese owner of the building, the mayor said.
     
            Al-Kassas said the Syrians had been renting the building, and that he was not aware of any links to Hezbollah.
     
            On Thursday morning, a young boy was pulled from underneath the rubble after an overnight effort led by the municipal authorities.
     
            Separately, three people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in the Tyre district of southern Lebanon on Thursday, and 17 others injured, the ministry of public health said.
     
Some context: More than a million Syrians have fled war in their homeland to take refuge in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have, to some extent, turned a blind eye to those entering the country illegally, and many hundreds of thousands of them are unregistered.
     
Correction: The timing of this strike has been updated in this post.
 
            The Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported that at 3.15 p.m. local time, Israeli warplanes launched three missiles targeting an apartment in a 10-story building near a busy intersection in the Al-Qaim neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs, known as Dahiyeh.
     
            CNN has geolocated the scene of the strike as Haret Hreik in Dahiyeh. This is a densely populated area with a strong Hezbollah presence, and where much of the group’s leadership is based.
     
            This is the sixth Israeli strike in Beirut this year.
     
            The Israeli military says it is “currently carrying out precise strikes” in the Lebanese capital Beirut.
     
            It offered no further details.
     
            CNN teams saw a plume of smoke rising from the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh.
     
More to follow.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to discuss a proposed temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah during talks at the UN General Assembly, an Israeli official told CNN.
 
            While the prime minister rejected suggestions the ceasefire would be imminent — instead asserting that the Israeli military would continue fighting “with full force” — the source said it was notable that Netanyahu has not denied reports that the US is pushing for a 21-day ceasefire.
     
            The ceasefire plan was proposed by the United States and its allies in an attempt to stop wider war in the region and was described by one senior US official as an “important breakthrough.”
     
Here’s what else to know: 
 
            • Netanyahu comments: In response to reports that a ceasefire was “imminent,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement: “The news about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond.” The Foreign Minister Israel Katz also said Israel would continue to fight Hezbollah “with all our might.”  But the Israeli source said that the main reason for Netanyahu’s trip to the UNGA was diplomatic talks, and that “Israel favors a diplomatic solution.”
     
            • Ceasefire plan: The details are scant, but we do know that the United States and its allies are pushing for a 21-day ceasefire that would allow for a pause in the fighting and room for diplomacy to take hold. President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
     
            • Right-wing politicians rage at Netanyahu: Right-wing Israeli ministers on Thursday expressed indignation at reports that the United States is pushing for a weeks-long ceasefire in Lebanon, and the silence from their own prime minister. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on X: “The enemy must not be given time to recover from the heavy blows.”
     
            • Strikes continue: The Israeli military said it struck about 75 targets in Lebanon overnight. The military added that it was continuing to “dismantle and degrade” Hezbollah infrastructure and capabilities. Sirens meanwhile sounded in northern Israel as around 45 rockets were launched towards the country from Lebanon this morning, the Israeli military said.
     
            • Thousands displaced: Fleeing Israeli bombardment, thousands of internally displaced people in Lebanon have headed for the city of Sidon on the Mediterranean coast, where schools have been opened to shelter them. Read their stories here. Separately, 70,000 people are registered in shelters across the country.
     
            A new wave of Israeli airstrikes hit Lebanon on Thursday afternoon local time.
     
            The Lebanese state news agency NNA reported attacks on southern and eastern Lebanon and areas bordering Syria.
     
            The Israeli military said it was “striking Hezbollah terror targets” in the country, adding that it “attacked infrastructures used to transfer weapons from Syrian territory to Hezbollah.”
     
            “Fighter jets of the Air Force recently attacked infrastructures on the Syria-Lebanon border, which are used by the terrorist organization Hezbollah to transfer weapons from Syrian territory to Hezbollah in Lebanon,” it said in a statement.
     
Some context: Israel has been launching a barrage of airstrikes across swathes of Lebanon as its conflict with Hezbollah escalates.
     
            Israel’s military has vowed to speed up its “offensive operations” against Hezbollah without reprieve. Troops on Wednesday held exercises simulating ground combat in Lebanon, which the military has not ruled out.
     
            Thousands of people in Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes amid the intense attacks.
     
            Of the many people who have fled their homes as Israel continues its air campaign in Lebanon, more than 70,000 are registered in shelters, Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi told reporters on Thursday.
     
            The total number of people who have fled southern and eastern Lebanon is likely to be far higher as many have fled to family homes and hotels, for example, aside from official shelters.
     
‘On the brink’: Israel and Hezbollah have been trading waves of strikes, forcing tens of thousands in Lebanon to flee their homes. More than 90,000 people are newly displaced in the country, the United Nations said. UN chief António Guterres has warned that Lebanon is “on the brink,” calling on Israel and Hezbollah to “stop the killing and destruction.”
     
            Adding to the pressure to prevent a regional war from erupting, the US and 10 of its allies called for a 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            Israel’s prime minister has dismissed reports suggesting there could be an imminent ceasefire and told the Israeli military to continue fighting “with full force.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that media reports suggesting there could be an imminent ceasefire in Lebanon were “incorrect” and that he has told the Israeli military to continue fighting “with full force.”
     
            Netanyahu has not responded to a ceasefire proposal made by the United States and France, the statement from his office said.
     
        “The news about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond,” the statement read.
     
 
        “The news about the supposed directive to moderate the fighting in the north is also the opposite of the truth. The prime minister instructed the (Israel Defense Forces) to continue the fighting with full force, and according to the plans presented to him.”
     
 
            Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that “there will be no ceasefire in the north,” and Israel will continue to fight Hezbollah “with all our might until victory and the safe return of residents of the north to their homes.”
     
Context: Netanyahu’s statement came after a backlash from right-wing Israeli ministers to reports that the US is pushing for a weeks-long ceasefire in Lebanon.
     
            An Israeli official told CNN earlier that talks over a potential temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah are a main motivator for Netanyahu’s trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.
     
            Sirens sounded in northern Israel as around 45 rockets were launched towards the country from Lebanon this morning, the Israeli military said.
     
        “Following the alerts that were activated in the Western Galilee area, about 45 launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon, some of them were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas,” the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
 
            Prior to this, the last rocket fire into northern Israel had been around 19 hours earlier.
     
            Hezbollah said it had sent a “barrage of rockets” towards Kiryat Motzkin and military sites north of Haifa in “defense of Lebanon” and in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
     
            Fleeing Israeli bombardment, thousands of internally displaced people in Lebanon have headed for the city of Sidon on the Mediterranean coast, where schools have been opened to shelter them.
     
            Om Mohammed said she walked for 12 hours on foot with her two young children to escape the bombardment in her village.
     
            She showed CNN the blisters and bruises on her and her son’s feet. They spent the night outside a municipality building resting on a wall and covered by a blanket. Mohamed, 10, is feverish and Om wakes him up to give him drops of medicine.
     
        “Our entire neighborhood is gone,” she said.
     
 
            Volunteer Reem Afifi told CNN: “The schools are full and people are sleeping here at the municipality and on the street.”
     
            Our interview was interrupted by loud booms, which the volunteers said were the sonic booms of Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier, in a bid to calm down families sheltering around the municipality building.
     
            Medical charity MedGlobal delivered 100 mattresses to people seeking shelter in a Beirut school on Wednesday.
     
            Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes across southern Lebanon since Israel started striking the country on Monday.
     
            About 10,000 of them are sheltering in schools and vocational complexes in Beirut, the Lebanese Crisis and Disaster Management Cell said, according to state news agency NNA.
     
            Thousands of others are fleeing across the border into Syria.
     
            Right-wing Israeli ministers on Thursday expressed indignation at reports that the United States is pushing for a weeks-long ceasefire in Lebanon, and the silence from their own prime minister.
     
            Wednesday brought the most explicit threat yet of a ground incursion in Lebanon. The Israeli military’s Chief of the General Staff, Herzi Halevi, told troops in the north that airstrikes in Lebanon were intended “to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.”
     
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not commented on the ceasefire reports carried by CNN and others.
     
            But, notably, he has not denied them as he flies to to speak at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where a confluence of world leaders could provide a forum for negotiations.
     
Here’s how some of the ministers have responded: 
 
            •  Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: “The enemy must not be given time to recover from the heavy blows he received and to reorganize for the continuation of the war after 21 days.”
     
            •  Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party said it would convene an “urgent meeting” today – an implicit threat to Netanyahu’s fragile governing coalition.
     
            •  Minister Orit Strock warned that “there is no moral mandate for a ceasefire. Not for 21 days. And not for 21 hours.”
     
            •  Even the head of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said that while a shorter ceasefire could make sense, “we will not accept any proposal that does not include removing Hezbollah from our northern border.”
     
            •  Culture Minister Miki Zohar, from Netanyahu’s Likud party, said that a ceasefire could be a “serious error.”
     
            An Israeli official has told CNN that talks over a potential temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah are a main motivator for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.
     
            The source said it was notable that Netanyahu, who is currently flying to New York, has not denied reports that the US is pushing for a 21-day ceasefire.
     
            The source added that the main reason for Netanyahu’s trip is these diplomatic talks, and the message in Israel’s briefings yesterday was that “Israel favors a diplomatic solution.”
     
            The Israeli military said it had struck about 75 targets in Lebanon overnight.
     
        “Overnight, the IAF, directed by IDF intelligence, struck approximately 75 terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Beqaa and in southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities, ready-to-fire launchers, terrorists, and terrorist infrastructure,” it said.
     
 
            The military added that it was continuing to “dismantle and degrade” Hezbollah infrastructure and capabilities.
     
            Both southern Lebanon and the Beqaa valley are Hezbollah strongholds and have borne the brunt of Israel’s ramped up airstrikes in recent days.
     
            Should the Israeli military launch a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon, it is likely to concentrate efforts in the southern parts of the country, according to CNN Military Analyst Cedric Leighton.
     
            Leighton said the military may then move toward the Litani River, which is roughly 18 miles into Lebanese territory, targeting areas that are controlled by Hezbollah.
     
            In this scenario, a large area that is defacto controlled by Hezbollah forces would fall into Israeli hands.
     
            Israel’s military chief told troops yesterday that its airstrikes in Lebanon were aiming to destroy Hezbollah’s infrastructure and to pave the way for a possible ground incursion by Israeli forces.
     
            Their rhetoric has again raised fears of an all-out war in Lebanon, which risks inflaming tensions across the region.
     
        “This could very easily spread beyond Lebanon,” Leighton told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade.
     
 
            The Lebanese Armed Forces are not expected to play a major role in an Israeli ground incursion, said Leighton.
     
            He said the Lebanese military was not as powerful as Hezbollah, which gets funding, training and weapons from Iran and is one of the most formidable paramilitary forces in the Middle East.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed Israel in the early hours of Thursday morning for the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, according to his government’s press office.
     
            Netanyahu had been set to fly on Wednesday and address the UN on Thursday but delayed his trip due to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            He is expected to speak at the General Assembly on Friday.
     
            United Nations chief António Guterres has warned that Lebanon is “on the brink,” calling on Israel and Hezbollah to “stop the killing and destruction.” He said the country had been experiencing its bloodiest period “in a generation” since their conflict escalated.
     
            Joining the push to prevent a regional war from erupting, the US and 10 of its allies called for a 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            Calls for de-escalation ramped up after Israel’s military said it was preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon and had called up two reserve brigades “for operational missions in the northern sector.”
     
Here’s what to know:
 
            The United States and several of its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border as they work to prevent a regional war from erupting and to jolt stalled hostage talks between Israel and Hamas.
     
            The proposal, described by one senior US official as an “important breakthrough,” comes amid deadly fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that many fear could spill into a wider conflict.
     
            Hoping to prevent such an outcome, diplomats and leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly spent the last 48 hours hurriedly working to secure a plan that would pause the fighting and allow room for diplomacy to take hold.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have yet to agree. But US officials said both parties were “familiar” with the contours of the proposal and voiced optimism the moment was right for it to be revealed publicly.
     
            President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
     
        “We were able to generate significant support from Europe, as well as the Arab nations,” Biden told reporters late Wednesday. “It’s important this war not widen.”

            The Israel Defense Forces opened fire near the Lebanese border after identifying suspicious movements, it said in a short statement in the early hours of Thursday local time.
     
            “A short while ago, following the identification of suspicious movements in the area of the Lebanese border, IDF soldiers opened fire in their direction,” the IDF said.
     
            “The soldiers are currently conducting searches in the area,” the IDF added, without providing additional details.
     
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for more details.
     
            UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned world leaders Wednesday that “hell is breaking out in Lebanon” and it is “on the brink.”
     
            Speaking at an emergency session of the UN Security Council, Guterres said Lebanon had been experiencing its deadliest period “in a generation.”
     
            Guterres emphasized that military escalation was in no one’s interest and called on both sides to do what they could to avoid all-out war.
     
            “To all sides let us say in one clear voice: stop the killing and destruction, tone (down) the rhetoric and threats, step back from the brink. An all-out war must be avoided at all costs. It would surely be an all-out catastrophe. The people of Lebanon as well as the people of Israel and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to be another Gaza,” he said.
     
            Despite pledging a “battle without limits” against Israel, Hezbollah’s response to days of Israeli attacks in Lebanon appears to have been carefully calibrated.
     
            Israel intercepted a missile fired by Hezbollah near Tel Aviv on Wednesday, an unprecedented attack by the militant group that reached deep into the country’s commercial heartlands
     
            But, Hezbollah’s gloves are far from fully off – the group has a range of medium and long-range missiles in its arsenal. Wednesday’s strike appeared to be a signal to indicate how powerful a punch it could pack.
     
What we know about Hezbollah’s weapons: Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage.
     
            Missiles with a range of up to 500km, but they would have to bypass Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system to cause damage. Hezbollah has been stockpiling rockets and missile since its last conflict with Israel in 2006.
     
Another advantage: Hezbollah has strategic depth. It enjoys strong alliances with the Iran-led axis of fighting groups which span Gaza, Yemen, Syria and Iraq, with Iran providing weapons and training to Hezbollah. The groups have increased coordination since the October 7 attack.
     
            The Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground invasion in Lebanon, according to the army chief.
     
            Herzi Halevi, the head of Israel’s military, told troops on Wednesday that its airstrikes in Lebanon this week were aiming to destroy Hezbollah’s infrastructure and to pave the way for Israeli forces to be on the ground.

            The United States and 10 of its allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border in a diplomatic push to prevent a regional war from erupting.
     
            The “immediate” ceasefire across the border would “provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement,” a Wednesday statement from the countries read.
     
            “The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,” a statement from the countries, which include the United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
     
        “It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety,” the statement read.“We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether.”
     
 
            President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a separate, joint statement that they had come to an agreement on calling for a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah “to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border.”
     
        “It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,” they said.

            France has been working with the US to secure a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah to allow negotiations, the French foreign minister said.
     
            Jean-Noel Barrot told the UN Security Council Wednesday night that details would be made public soon. He said he was counting on both sides to accept the proposal without delay to protect civilians and allow diplomatic negotiations to begin.
     
            “A diplomatic solution is indeed possible,” he said, adding that he would travel to Beirut at the end of the week to work with local stakeholders.
     
            Sources familiar with the matter have told CNN that American officials are working with counterparts from France and other nations to try to reach a diplomatic agreement that would pause fighting along Israel’s northern border while also resuming talks on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal for Gaza.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will land in New York Thursday morning and address the UN General Assembly on Friday, Israel’s ambassador to UN Danny Danon told reporters ahead of a UN Security Council meeting Wednesday.
     
            UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned world leaders Wednesday that “hell is breaking out in Lebanon” and it is “on the brink.”

            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran would not remain indifferent in the event of a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            Speaking in New York ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday, Araghchi said Iran supports Hezbollah in what he called the group’s “just cause to defend Lebanon” against Israel.
     
        “We stand with the people of Lebanon with all means,” he said at a press conference.
     
 
            The foreign minister urged the council to intervene and restore security in the region, warning that if it doesn’t act, the region risks a full-scale conflict.
     
Context: Araghchi’s remarks come as Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Wednesday killed more than 80 people according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel’s military said it struck 70 Hezbollah intelligence facilities in its latest round of strikes and more than 2,000 targets over the past three days.
     
            The Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground incursion in Lebanon, the army chief told troops. It comes after Israel and Hezbollah have traded waves of airstrikes and rocket attacks, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
     
            Meanwhile, the United States is working urgently on a plan to mediate a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, sources say. President Joe Biden and key officials in his administration have been discussing the details with other world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York this week.
     
            Here are some of the key headlines from the region, broken down:
     
The details behind a possible ceasefire deal 
 
Paving the way for a possible ground incursion
 
Hezbollah launches missile
 
Tens of thousands displaced
 
            As Israeli airstrikes impact civilians in Lebanon, Project Hope, an international global health and humanitarian aid non-governmental organization, says it is mobilizing medical supplies and basic living materials to address the needs of the displaced people. It also says it is increasing its reserves of medical supplies to prepare for possible further escalation in the area that could require a heightened emergency response.
     
            Arlan Fuller, director of emergency preparedness and response for Project Hope, said he had met with Lebanese health and emergency officials days before the deadly pager and walkie-talkie explosions to assess the needs of the country’s health system in a scenario of escalations.
     
            Those conversations helped the organization to respond to the waves of explosion while also planning for a possible escalation between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            One of the primary concerns when planning for a possible escalation was having enough medicine and trauma supplies, he told CNN.
     
            “Even what we were seeing in terms of these pager explosions — so many different injuries there that were coming through in the hundreds to the ERs and having to be dealt with. So how quickly you can go through those supplies really is something that would have an equal impact, and certainly something that needs to be mindful of,” he said.
     
            The Ministry of Public Health told Project Hope that their projections showed there were “only maybe a few months” of medicines available across the board, Fuller explained, adding that basic medicines, antibiotics and all aspects of regular day-to-day primary care is “a top priority.”
     
            It would not just be a priority to provide medical supplies when needed, but also to be able to have plenty of them in reserve. That’s because the fear of escalation is very real in the region, he said, and officials have conveyed that in such a scenario, supplies could run out quickly.
     
            Project Hope is currently mobilizing two mobile medical units outside shelters in Lebanon for people displaced by Israeli airstrikes. It has also surveyed 16 schools that have been turned into shelters, to assess the requirement for blankets, mattresses and hygiene and cleaning supplies, according to Fuller.
     
            The death toll from Israel’s airstrikes in Lebanon on Wednesday has risen to at least 81 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            At least 403 other people were wounded in the strikes, the ministry said.
     
            The latest Israeli strikes hit the town of Younine, in northeastern Lebanon, killing at least nine people and injuring 11 others, the ministry said. Rescue operations there are ongoing, it added.
     
            Senior United States officials who have been furiously working to hammer out a framework for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah are hoping to announce a proposal as soon as tonight, sources tell CNN.
     
            One of those sources also said that the effort to mediate a ceasefire began in earnest for the Biden administration after President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke on the phone with top Israeli official Ron Dermer on Monday.
     
            The proposed ceasefire plan, when announced, is expected to come from the US and other nations. It would then require agreement from Israel and Hezbollah.
 
            A European diplomat expressed skepticism about the prospects of the efforts succeeding, saying they see “no reason to be optimistic right now.” The diplomat added that ongoing talks are pushing ahead but the “situation is deteriorating and escalating by the hour.”
     
            Biden has been discussing the escalating hostilities in the Middle East with various world leaders this week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York City. On Wednesday, Biden discussed the matter with French President Emmanuel Macron, the White House said.
     
            Syria has put a new system in place to help the thousands of Syrians and Lebanese who have crossed into the country in recent days after fleeing Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon.
     
            Syria’s state-run SANA news agency said Wednesday the Rif Dimashq governorate had formed an “operations room” to assist those arriving from “brotherly Lebanon.” The governorate is in the southwest of the country, bordering Lebanon in the west and Jordan in the south.
     
            Governor of Rif Dimashq Ahmed Khalil said the plan was to provide the “necessary support” to thousands of displaced people and establish “shelter centers” to accommodate them.
     
Some context: Since Tuesday, at least 6,697 Lebanese and 17,850 Syrians have crossed into Syria through the Jdeidet Yabous crossing on the Syrian-Lebanese border, the deputy governor of Rif Dimashq, Jassem Al-Mahmoud, told Damascus-based Sham FM radio on Wednesday.
     
            Many of those fleeing have no concrete plans after they cross, UNHCR Middle East spokesperson Rula Amin warned earlier.
     
            The prime minister of Norway slammed Israel’s attacks in both Lebanon and Gaza, saying the Israeli military actions is “not proportional” and a “breach of what international law sets as limits.”
     
        “This is not going to enhance security,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said of Israel’s attacks in both places. “It is extremely shortsighted. I appreciate Israel’s right to defend itself after (October 7), it is clearly written into international law. But international law is also very clear on the proportionality of this.”
     
 
            Støre told CNN they are “dangerous conflicts” that are at risk of escalating. Speaking to reporting that the United States is working on a plan to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, Støre said he welcomes the American’s efforts, but “it is really up to the key parties here” to find a solution.
     
            Støre said Israel launching a ground invasion of Lebanon would be a “major escalation” and countries should work to prevent that from happening.
     
            The prime minister also said world leaders have also been meeting with Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, “to impress upon him that Iran must play the de-escalation card. They are in direct link when many of these groups.”
     
Some background: Støre previously said he believes there will be “no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution” or “without a Palestinian state” — something Netanyahu has been vocally against. His country moved to formally recognize Plestianian statehood in May.
     
            Israeli’s Hostages and Missing Families Forum has harshly criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not mentioning those still being held in Gaza in his speech about Lebanon, calling it “a blatant and total disregard for the existence of the hostages” still in the enclave.
     
            On Wednesday, in a televised speech Netanyahu said, “I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing: we are determined to return our residents in the north safely to their homes.”
     
            The Forum said of the speech, “If we needed more proof of the final abandonment of the hostages — we got it tonight.”
     
        “It is important to return the residents of the north to their homes, but unlike the hostages, they are here, living with us, even if they suffer and are cut off from their homes. Compared to the hostages who both suffer and die in captivity in the death tunnels of Hamas,” it said in a statement.
     
 
            A deal to bring back Gaza hostages would also result in the return of evacuees, the Forcum argued, “and will allow for the restoration and revival of the State of Israel.”
     
            The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias in the country, claimed on Wednesday it was behind a drone attack on the southern Israeli port of Eilat.
     
            The group said it did so in support of “our people in Palestine and Lebanon.”
     
            The Israeli military has not confirmed who was behind the attack, but said the drones approached “from the east.”
     
            When asked by reporters about the drones fired from Iraq and whether Israel would strike the country, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at a press conference on Wednesday: “We are following the threat from Iraq. We are looking at it during our situational assessment, collecting intelligence and we will do whatever is necessary to deal with the situation.”
     
Some background: Wednesday’s attack on Eilat came after one of the most powerful groups in the Islamic Resistance, Kataib Hezbollah, urged other Iran-backed militias in a statement to increase their attacks on Israel.
     
            Iran-backed militant groups in Iraq have been targeting US sites in Iraq and Israel since October 7, saying the attacks are in support of the people in Gaza. The latest escalation between Israel and Lebanon has prompted those militias to increase their attacks.
     
            Israel Defense Forces (IDF) struck 2,000 targets in Lebanon over the past three days, amid its intense waves of strikes against Hezbollah, spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Wednesday.
     
            That includes 70 Hezbollah intelligence sites in its latest round of strikes on Wednesday, according to the military.
     
            “In today’s strikes, we struck a wide range of targets from the air on the intelligence headquarters system,” Hagari said. “We struck 70 different locations, and that’s how we are making it difficult for Hezbollah to create an intelligence picture.”

            Many of the thousands of Syrians and Lebanese people fleeing across the border to Syria have no concrete plan for after they cross, a top official at the United Nations refugee agency has warned.
     
            UNHCR Middle East spokesperson Rula Amin told CNN many people have crossed over into Syria “without really a specific plan.”
     
            “We have seen in the past three days; thousands of people have crossed. Lebanese and Syrians… They took this decision very quickly,” Amin said.
     
        “In Lebanon, every day the areas that you can deem as safe are narrowing down as the targeting areas that Israeli bombings are expanding,” Amin said.
     
 
            For any of the 1.5 million Syrian refugees currently in Lebanon who choose to return home, they may find that their former “home has been destroyed,” Amin said. As for the Lebanese choosing to cross, it’s unclear whether they will “stay for one week or stay for a month,” he said.
     
            A journalist working for CNN on the Lebanese side of the main checkpoint from Lebanon into Syria, Al Masnaa, saw long lines of cars stretched along waiting to enter and be processed.
     
            One male Syrian refugee said himself and his family fled the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh after their house was bombed by Israel.
     
            “We tried to escape to Beirut, but there was no housing or anything. We hope that they open the borders so we can go to our people in Syria” the man said.
     
            Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given the green light for his government to engage with US efforts to mediate a ceasefire in Lebanon, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            The official said that Netanyahu gave his approval with the understanding that any agreement would have to allow the return of Israeli civilians to their homes in northern Israel, later adding that his country “will not rest” until that happens.
     
            “I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing: we are determined to return our residents in the north safely to their homes,” the prime minister said.
     
            Amos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser, is involved, the source said, adding that the Americans are not speaking to Hezbollah directly.
     
            CNN reported on Wednesday that the United States was working urgently on a plan to deescalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, according to three sources familiar with the matter, as officials eye with deepening concern the prospects of a widening conflict.
     
            The United States was working urgently Wednesday on a plan to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, according to three sources familiar with the matter, as officials eye with deepening concern the prospects of a widening conflict.
     
            American officials were working with officials from France and other nations to try and reach a diplomatic agreement that would pause fighting along Israel’s northern border while also resuming ceasefire and hostage talks for Gaza, the sources said.
     
            The efforts come as Israel’s top general said Wednesday that the Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon.
     
            American officials declined to provide specifics on the proposed plans, but the matter was under intensive discussion among diplomats in New York for this week’s United Nations General Assembly meetings. It was unclear how much progress had been made toward striking an agreement — but it could be a focus at the UN Security Council emergency meeting scheduled for later Wednesday that France called for.
     
            On Monday night, a US official told CNN that the administration was extremely close to finalizing a plan to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah and Hamas, but that officials were trying to keep the negotiations as private as possible to avoid upending the fragile talks involving multiple countries.
     
            Speaking on ABC’s daytime talk show The View, US President Biden alluded to ongoing talks to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon that would unlock further peace discussions elsewhere in the region. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said the US was working toward a plan that would allow displaced Israeli and Lebanese citizens to return to their homes.
     
            Despite pledging a “battle without limits” against Israel, Hezbollah’s response to back-to-back Israeli attacks appears to have been carefully calibrated.
     
            Its strike Wednesday that was intercepted near Tel Aviv managed to be both unprecedented and understated. It marked many firsts:
     
            But given the strength of Israel’s air defenses, a single missile – even a ballistic one – was always likely to have been shot down.
     
            Why, then, launch just one? As the risk of all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah – and their respective American and Iranian backers – grows each day, the lone shot on Tel Aviv could be taken as both a threat and a cease-and-desist. We have powerful weapons at our disposal, and a powerful friend at our beck and call – don’t try us, Hezbollah seemed to say.
     
            The militant group’s gloves are far from fully off – the group has a range of medium and long-range missiles in its arsenal, but Wednesday’s strike appeared to be a signal to indicate how powerful a punch it could pack.
     
            While both sides have refrained from declaring that they are at war with each other, their ramped-up goals may make that moot. Hezbollah insists there will be no ceasefire in Lebanon until there is one in Gaza. Netanyahu’s government not only insists there will not be a ceasefire in Gaza – but its pivot to Lebanon makes the possibility of a deal even more remote.

            The Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon, its top general said on Wednesday.
     
            “You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day,” Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Chief of the General Staff, told troops while visiting the northern border, according to a military press release. “This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.”
     
            It is the second time Wednesday that a top Israeli general has said that a ground operation may be imminent. Israel’s top general in the north, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, said that the military “must be fully prepared for maneuvers.”
     
            It also comes just hours after the Israel Defense Forces said it was calling up two reserve brigades because of the conflict with Hezbollah.
     
            Halevi told troops that in order to return 60,000 Israelis to their homes in the north, “we are preparing the process of a maneuver.”
     
            It “means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory, enter villages that Hezbollah has prepared as large military outposts, with underground infrastructure, staging points, and launchpads into our territory and carry out attacks on Israeli civilians,” he said.
     
            “Your entry into those areas with force, your encounter with Hezbollah operatives, will show them what it means to face a professional, highly skilled, and battle-experienced force. You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.”
     
            US President Joe Biden said “all-out war” is possible in the Middle East but that the window is still open to pull the region back from the brink of escalating conflict.
     
            “An all out war is possible,” Biden said on the ABC daytime talk show “The View.”
     
            “But I think there’s also the opportunity — we’re still in play to have a settlement that could fundamentally change the whole region,” he continued.
     
            Biden was speaking as tensions were ratcheting up between Israel and Hezbollah and as American officials described ceasefire and hostage talks in Gaza as stalled.
     
            The president reiterated the importance of finding a two-state solution and said a pathway was still open to securing such an outcome.
     
            “There’s a way to do it, and they have a possibility – I don’t want to exaggerate it, but a possibility — if we can deal with a ceasefire in Lebanon, that it can move into dealing with the West Bank, but we also have Gaza to deal with,” he said.
     
            “But it’s possible,” he said, “and I’m using every bit of energy I have with my team…to get this done. There’s a desire to see change in the region.”
     
            Dozens of US troops have been deployed to Cyprus amid sharply escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, and they are preparing for a range of contingencies including a possible evacuation operation from Lebanon for US citizens should a full-blown war erupt, two US officials told CNN.
     
            Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said earlier this week that the US military would be deploying “a small number of US military personnel forward” to the region “out of an abundance of caution.” But he declined to say how many troops were deployed, where they were sent, and what branch they belonged to.
     
Some background: Cyprus played a key role in helping to evacuate foreign nationals from Lebanon during Israel’s war with Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, facilitating the departure and accommodation of tens of thousands of people at the time as they fled the conflict.
     
            Cyprus’s deputy government spokesperson, Yiannis Antoniou, told Reuters last month that the island nation is again on standby to help if needed.
     
            The UK announced on Tuesday that it was sending 700 troops to Cyprus to prepare for a possible emergency evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon if one becomes necessary.
     
            “The most important message from me this evening is to British nationals in Lebanon, to leave immediately and I just want to reinforce that,” said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The US State Department has also repeatedly warned US citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial travel options are still available.
     
            Seeking shelter from Israeli bombardment, thousands who had been living in southern Lebanon are reportedly now trying to enter Syria.
     
            The UN refugee agency reported Wednesday that the main highway leading to the Lebanon-Syria border was choked with hundreds of cars, as it observed rising numbers fleeing “in desperation.”
     
            One man told CNN that he had been driving for two days seeking shelter after his house was bombed by Israel.
     
            “We tried to escape to Beirut, but there was no housing or anything. We hope that they open the borders so we can go to our people in Syria. That is it really!,” he told CNN at the checkpoint to enter Syria border.
     
            When asked if they knew anyone in Syria, the man replied:
     
            “We want to go and see if there is someone [to help us].”
     
            More than 90,000 people are newly displaced in Lebanon, the United Nations said on Wednesday, as the “exodus of people from south Lebanon to north of the Litani River” amid Israel’s large-scale air campaign continued.
     
            “At least 90,530 newly displaced people have been reported including nearly 40,000 in 283 shelters,” the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.
     
            Some of these people will “likely” include those who fled their homes since Israel and Hezbollah traded fire in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel last year.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the US is “working tirelessly” on diplomatic efforts to prevent a “full-blown war” as Israel continues to ratchet up its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            “Risk of escalation in the region is acute, and I know that we are all very much focused on that,” Blinken told his counterparts in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) at a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
     
            The top US diplomat also acknowledged efforts on a Gaza ceasefire deal, telling the foreign ministers, “each of us has to continue to press all of the parties to make the decisions necessary to get this deal over the finish line.”
     
            Blinken also called on the regional organization, comprised of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, to work “to deter destabilizing activities by Iran.”
     
            “We also look to the West Bank to ensure that violence against innocent Palestinians stops. That too is critical,” he said.
     
            At least 51 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Wednesday, the Lebanese minister of health said.
     
            “As of now, there are 51 martyrs and 223 injured in today’s various strikes on Al-Muaisira, Jounieh, Baalbek-Hermel, and southern areas,” Dr. Firass Abyad told reporters.
     
            “Large waves” of people have been displaced across Lebanon, he said, including hospital patients who had been undergoing dialysis in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa valley.
     
            The government would provide medicine and infant formula to those who need it, the minister added.
     
            The death toll has risen throughout the day. Earlier Wednesday, the ministry of health said 23 people had been killed by Israeli strikes.  
 
            Israel’s security cabinet will convene at the Kirya – the Israel Defense Forces headquarters in Tel Aviv – at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) on Wednesday, an official told CNN as the country said it launched a third day of “extensive” strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
     
            The Israeli military said it hit more than 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Wednesday – the third day of its “extensive” strikes.
     
            “In total, over 280 Hezbollah terror targets have been struck today in Lebanon, and the IDF is continuing to conduct strikes against additional targets,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
     
            The IDF said its targets included rocket launch sites used to fire projectiles toward the northern Israeli cities of Safed and Nahariya on Wednesday morning. Fighter jets hit 60 targets belonging to Hezbollah’s intelligence unit and destroyed surveillance equipment, command rooms and intelligence-gathering infrastructure.
     
            At least 23 people were killed in the Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Nearly 600 people have been killed and almost 1,700 injured in the strikes since Monday, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), citing Lebanese government figures.
     
            Israel struck more than 1,300 targets on Monday and around 250 on Tuesday, according to the IDF.
     
            At the peak of Syria’s devastating civil war, its neighbors took in millions of refugees. A decade on, Lebanon is still housing more than 1.5 million people from that country, according to UN data.
     
            Now though, people are heading in the opposite direction as the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah escalates. The UN refugee agency reported Wednesday that the main highway leading to the Lebanon-Syria border was choked with hundreds of cars, as it observed rising numbers fleeing “in desperation.”
     
            “Hundreds of vehicles are backed up in queues at the Syrian border. Many people are also arriving on foot, carrying what they can,” the UNHCR said in an update Wednesday.
     
            “Large crowds, including women, young children and babies are waiting in line after spending the night outdoors in falling temperatures. Some carry fresh injuries from the recent bombardments.”
     
            UN staff deployed to border crossings have been providing supplies including food, water, blankets and mattresses and “guiding them towards support available once in Syria,” the UNHCR said.
     
            Thousands of people have been displaced by Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon in recent days with the UNHCR warning Tuesday that numbers are only set to rise. “Over 27,000 people have been displaced over the past 48 hours, and more are abandoning their homes by the minute,” UNHCR stressed in its Wednesday update.
     
            The Israeli military is calling up two reserve brigades over its conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Wednesday.
     
            “In accordance with the assessment of the situation in the IDF, it was decided to recruit two reserve brigades for operational missions in the northern sector,” the military said in a statement.
     
            “Their recruitment will allow the continuation of the fighting effort against the terrorist organization Hezbollah, the protection of the citizens of the State of Israel and the creation of the conditions for the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.
     
            The military last week said that it was moving the elite 98th division from Gaza to northern Israel. A brigade typically consists of several thousand troops.
     
            The commander of the IDF’s Northern Command, Major General Uri Gordin, said Tuesday that the operation in Lebanon had reached a “different phase.”
     
            “We need to be very strongly prepared to enter the maneuver and into action,” he said while visiting troops of the 7th Brigade in northern Israel.
     
            The Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday also hinted at the possibility of ground maneuvers.
     
            “You understand that the moment may come when we give an order and the system will have to move forward, so preparations must be made,” he said. during a visit with troops.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Hamas has not engaged in the ceasefire and hostage negotiations over the past few weeks as he again argued that they are very few issues that need to be resolved on the potential agreement.
     
            “We have a piece of paper an agreement. It’s got 18 paragraphs — 15 of those paragraphs have been agreed between Hamas and Israel,” Blinken said on NBC’s Today Show.
     
            “But what’s happened over the last few weeks is Hamas has simply not been at the table, not been willing to engage on the remaining outstanding issues, that if we close them, we’ll close the deal, we’ll get it over the finish line.”
     
            The top US diplomat noted that “Israel would have some hard decisions to make in the very end game, too, so we have to look to that.”
     
            CNN reported Wednesday that senior US officials had largely stopped making a vigorous push on the ceasefire negotiations in recent days, having determined there is currently no political will on either side — Hamas or Israel’s — to end the conflict.
     
            White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby called Hezbollah’s attempt to fire a ballistic missile near Tel Aviv “deeply concerning” in an interview on CNN Wednesday.
     
            Israel said that they intercepted the Hezbollah missile — which would mark an unprecedented attack by the militant group that reached deep into Israel’s commercial heartlands and marked a new escalatory step in the conflict between the two sides.
     
            “It’s certainly deeply concerning, obviously, to the Israelis, of course, but also to us, because, as Secretary (Antony) Blinken just said a little bit ago, we really have been working hard since the beginning of this conflict to prevent it from escalating and deepening and broadening, and one of the key areas that we’ve been trying to prevent escalation is between Israel and Hezbollah up along that border with Lebanon,” Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan.
     
            Kirby also appeared to push back on CNN’s reporting this morning that the Biden administration has all but paused a push for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Kirby told CNN that in his view, the Israelis “continue to talk to us about moving this thing forward.”
     
            “The proposal on the table was an Israeli proposal. It’s the one that the prime minister and his team put forward, and they continue to talk to us about moving this thing forward. I would just tell you that Mr. Sinwar is the main obstacle,” he said.
     
            Yahya Sinwar is the head of Hamas.
     
            Sources told CNN earlier that senior US officials had largely stopped making a vigorous push on the ceasefire negotiations, having determined there is currently no political will on either side — Hamas or Israel’s — to end the conflict.
     
            Families of hostages held in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday said they fear the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could “overshadow” the plight of their loved ones.
     
            “The recent escalation of tensions in northern Israel has heightened our anxiety and deepened our concerns. We fear that this new crisis may overshadow the plight of our 101 loved ones, who have been held by Hamas in horrific conditions for 355 days,” Israel’s Hostage and Missing Families Forum said in a statement published ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trip to the United Nations in New York.
     
            “We expect that the release of hostages will be a central topic in both the discussions at the UN General Assembly and PM Netanyahu’s speech,” the Forum added.
     
            “Securing a deal to bring them all back [must be] treated as the utmost priority.”
     
            As Israel’s campaign continues in Lebanon, thousands of civilians have fled their homes and many have sought shelter inside schools.
     
            “We are all civilians and many people were martyred while sitting in their homes,” Helme Mahmoud told CNN.
     
            A Hezbollah missile intercepted near Israel’s economic center Tel Aviv is the first fired by the militant group to reach close to the city, the Israeli military said.
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad, which it blames for attacks targeting its members, including the explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have traded waves of strikes since Israeli attacks targeting the militant group killed more than 500 people on Monday, the deadliest day in Lebanon in more than two decades.
     
Here’s what to know:
 
• People flee southern Lebanon: People are fearing for their lives as they flee Israeli airstrikes. “There were dead bodies strewn on the side of the road, people with their arms blown off. Even the ambulances that tried to reach them were struck,” one man told CNN in Beirut. The city is providing shelter for about 10,000 people displaced by recent Israeli attacks.
     
            • Wednesday death toll: The death toll from Israel’s airstrikes on Lebanon on Wednesday has risen to 23, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health.• Children under rubble: Many children remain “missing under rubble” after Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, warned. More children were killed in Lebanon in one day on Monday alone than in the past year.• Senior commander killed: An Israeli airstrike killed one of Hezbollah’s senior commanders, Ibrahim Qubaisi, yesterday. The Israeli military said Qubaisi commanded various missile units and was killed along with two other commanders in southern Beirut.• What’s next? Israel’s military has vowed to speed up its “offensive operations” against Hezbollah without reprieve. Troops held exercises simulating ground combat in Lebanon, which the military has not ruled out.
     
            The death toll from Israel’s airstrikes on Lebanon on Wednesday has risen to 23, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health.
     
            Most of the deaths were reported in the south of the country: Four are in Joun, three in Ain Qana, two in Tibneen and three in Bint Jbeil.
     
            Another three were killed in the mountain village of Maaysrah north of Beirut. Meanwhile, four people died in what the ministry described as “consecutive Israeli airstrikes” on towns in Baalbek-Hermel region in the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
     
            Dozens of people were also injured in the strikes.
     
            Protests against Israel’s war in Gaza and military offensive in Lebanon took place across the United States on Tuesday evening.
     
            Here are some photos from the scenes:
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged that Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leaders is “definitely a loss” for the group — but won’t be enough to destroy it, state-run IRNA news agency reported on Wednesday.
     
        “Yes, they incur damage. Some of the effective and valuable elements of Hezbollah were martyred, it was definitely a loss for Hezbollah. But, it is not enough to destroy Hezbollah,” Khamenei said.
     
 
        “Hezbollah’s organizational and personnel strength is much more than this. Their authority, their ability, their strength is beyond getting seriously damaged by these martyrdoms.”
     
 
            Khamenei held the United States responsible for Israel’s attacks in Lebanon, saying Washington “pretends that it isn’t involved” but needs Israel to win the war ahead of elections this year.
     
            The foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt and Iraq have “condemned the Israeli aggression on Lebanon” in a joint statement and warned that Israel is pushing the region toward an “all-out war.”
     
            The ministers met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York yesterday, where they urged the international community and the Security Council to “assume their relevant responsibilities to stop the war.”
     
            “Israel bears full responsibility for this deterioration, which will have serious consequences for the entire region,” they said Wednesday.
     
            Stopping the “ongoing dangerous escalation” in the Middle East “begins with stopping the Israeli aggression on Gaza,” the officials said.
     
Some background: Israel has vowed to speed up its military offensives against Hezbollah without reprieve as it executes a new war objective: to return tens of thousands of residents evacuated from their homes in the north due to cross-border attacks.
     
            With the Biden administration pausing work on ceasefire negotiations to end the war in Gaza, Israel’s fresh assaults on Hezbollah in Lebanon this week add a layer of complication, making prospects for a near-term deal all the more difficult – if not impossible – at least while the bombs are falling.
     
            In recent days, senior US officials had largely stopped making a vigorous push on the ceasefire negotiations, sources told CNN, having determined there is currently no political will on either side – Hamas or Israel’s – to end the conflict.
     
            Even as President Joe Biden and top aides refuse to abandon the effort entirely, a senior Democrat close to the White House summed up the sentiment among some officials involved in those deliberations this way:
     
        “We can’t want this more than they want it.”
     
 
            This person also cited a line from former Secretary of State James Baker, who in 1990 said in a message directed at the Israeli government about a Middle East peace deal: “When you’re serious about this, call us.”
     
            Another quote circulating among American officials as they assess the stalled talks is George Mitchell’s description of the process that eventually brought about the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland: “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.”
     
            Ending the Gaza conflict is Biden’s top foreign policy goal as he nears the end of his one-term presidency, but the stalled ceasefire talks are threatening to sink the president’s other priorities in the Middle East.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly debate due to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Netanyahu was set to fly today and speak tomorrow, but his office said he would now fly to New York on Thursday and return Saturday. He is expected to speak at the UN on Friday.
     
            US President Joe Biden only briefly mentioned the widening of fighting in the Middle East in his speech to the UN General Assembly yesterday, which came after cross-border strikes killed hundreds. While acknowledging “the situation has escalated,” Biden said, “a diplomatic solution is still possible.”
     
            It is unclear whether Israel intends – or will feel compelled – to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon. But the question looms: Can the country take on a second front?
     
            Since the day after Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel last year, there has been regular cross-border fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks.
     
            The stakes were raised last week when Israel wounded thousands of people across Lebanon, detonating pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. Escalating exchanges of fire have followed.
     
            Should Israel enter full-scale war with Hezbollah, experts say it will face a much stronger threat than Hamas – and commensurate costs.
     
        “Hezbollah is not Hamas,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv who served in Israel’s National Security Council under three prime ministers. Hezbollah is “a state within a state” with far more sophisticated military capabilities, he told CNN.
     
 
            Read the full analysis.
 
            Hezbollah’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the militant group and Israel have seen near-daily clashes since the war in Gaza began.
     
Here’s what to know about their decades-long conflict
 
Israeli invasion: Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory when it invaded in 1982. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation led to the deaths of over 17,000 people, according to reports and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at a Beirut refugee camp. The investigation held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the Christian Lebanese fighters.
     
The rise of Hezbollah: As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by Iran burst onto the scene. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel and civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
Support for Gaza: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has increasingly clashed with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started — and has vowed to continue until the war ends.
     
Killing of key leader: Tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, with a strike on Beirut in July. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles into Israel.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both Israel and Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. More than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon.

            Our live coverage has moved here. 
     
            The death toll from Israel’s airstrikes on Lebanon on Wednesday has risen to 23, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health.
     
            Most of the deaths were reported in the south of the country: Four were in Joun, three in Ain Qana, two in Tibneen and three in Bint Jbeil.
     
            Another three were killed in the mountain village of Maaysrah north of Beirut. Meanwhile, seven people died in what the ministry described as “consecutive Israeli airstrikes” on towns in the Baalbek-Hermel region in the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.  
     
            Dozens of people were also injured in the strikes.  
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged that Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leaders is “definitely a loss” for the group — but won’t be enough to destroy it, state-run IRNA news agency reported on Wednesday. 
     
        “Yes, they incur damage. Some of the effective and valuable elements of Hezbollah were martyred, it was definitely a loss for Hezbollah. But, it is not enough to destroy Hezbollah,” Khamenei said.“Hezbollah’s organizational and personnel strength is much more than this. Their authority, their ability, their strength is beyond getting seriously damaged by these martyrdoms.” 
     
 
            Khamenei held the United States responsible for Israel’s attacks in Lebanon, saying Washington “pretends that it isn’t involved” but needs Israel to win the war ahead of elections this year.  
     
            The death toll from Israel’s war in Gaza has risen to 41,495, with injuries at 96,006 as of Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry said. 
     
            Twenty-eight people were killed and 85 injured in four major attacks in 24 hours, it said without adding locations. A number of victims remain under the rubble and ambulances and civil defense crews are unable to reach them.
     
            Separately, on Wednesday, in what is believed to be a first, Palestinian authorities in Gaza refused to accept 88 unidentified bodies when they arrived at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.
     
Remember: Throughout the war in Gaza, Israeli authorities have regularly returned corpses to Gaza, but the bodies are almost always unidentified, making it extremely difficult to return them to their families. 
     
            Israel’s military has throughout the conflict exhumed bodies in Gaza and brought them to Israel to confirm they are not hostages before returning them.
     
            Their return in shipping containers is usually a macabre affair. Palestinians crowd the containers in the hope that their missing loved ones’ remains are among the returns. CNN has in the past reported on the transfers.
     
            CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces about Wednesday’s transfer. It is unclear where the bodies are now.
     
            The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was not involved in the transfer, but said “all families have the right to receive news about their loved ones and bury them respectfully.”
     
            At least 10 people were killed in Lebanon on Wednesday, officials said, as the Israeli military launched “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah in the south and east of the country.  
     
            Three people were killed and 13 injured in the town of Ain Qana in southern Lebanon, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said. At least three others were killed and nine injured after a strike on Al-Maaysra in Keserwan, and four more were killed and seven injured in Joun. 
     
            In a post around 11 a.m. local time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was “conducting extensive strikes in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa area.” The IDF told CNN it had struck more than 100 targets in Lebanon on Wednesday so far.  
     
            Multiple Israeli airstrikes hit southern and eastern Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including towns and villages near Nabatiyeh in the south and in the Beqaa Valley in the east, according to the Lebanese state news agency NNA. The towns of Nabi Sheet, Tallet Jabal Al-Malah, and Al-Muaisira were subjected to a “wide-scale aerial assault,” NNA reported.
     
            The IDF later posted an update that said around 40 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday morning.  
     
            Several were intercepted but one hit an assisted-living facility near the northern Israeli city of Safed, the IDF said. “No injuries were reported,” it added.  
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have traded waves of strikes since Israeli attacks targeting the militant group killed more than 500 people on Monday, the deadliest day in Lebanon in more than two decades. 
     
            Protests against Israel’s war in Gaza and military offensive in Lebanon took place across the United States on Tuesday evening. 
     
            Here are some photos from the scenes: 
     
            The foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt and Iraq have “condemned the Israeli aggression on Lebanon” in a joint statement and warned that Israel is pushing the region toward an “all-out war.”
     
            The ministers met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York yesterday, where they urged the international community and the Security Council to “assume their relevant responsibilities to stop the war.”   
     
        “Israel bears full responsibility for this deterioration, which will have serious consequences for the entire region,” they said Wednesday. 
     
 
            Stopping the “ongoing dangerous escalation” in the Middle East “begins with stopping the Israeli aggression on Gaza,” the officials said.
     
Some background: Israel has vowed to speed up its military offensives against Hezbollah without reprieve as it executes a new war objective: to return tens of thousands of residents evacuated from their homes in the north due to cross-border attacks.  
     
            With the Biden administration pausing work on ceasefire negotiations to end the war in Gaza, Israel’s fresh assaults on Hezbollah in Lebanon this week are adding a layer of complication, making prospects for a near-term deal all the more difficult – if not impossible – at least while the bombs are falling.

            Israel’s military said it had detected about five “projectiles” south of Haifa launched from Lebanon, as Israel and Hezbollah trade waves of strikes. 
     
        “Following the sirens that sounded in the areas of Menashe, Hacarmel, and Wadi Ara, approximately five projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,” it said. 
     
 
            The military said several of the projectiles had been intercepted while “a projectile fall” had also been identified in the area. 
     
            The areas covered by warnings were located along Israel’s Mediterranean coast between the cities of Haifa and Tel Aviv. 
     
            The Israeli military said it had struck a rocket launcher in southern Lebanon from which the “numerous projectiles” were fired at Wadi Ara. 
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly debate due to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Netanyahu was set to fly today and speak tomorrow, but his office said he would now fly to New York on Thursday and return Saturday. He is expected to speak at the UN on Friday.

            A Hezbollah missile intercepted near Israel’s economic center Tel Aviv is the first fired by the militant group to reach close to the city, the Israeli military said. 
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad, which it blames for attacks targeting its members, including the explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have traded waves of strikes since Israeli attacks targeting the militant group killed more than 500 people on Monday, the deadliest day in Lebanon in more than two decades.
     
Here’s what to know: 
     
            The Hezbollah missile intercepted Wednesday near Tel Aviv marks the first time a missile fired by the militant group has reached close to the city, the Israeli military said, marking a new escalatory step in the conflict between the two sides. 
     
        “It’s the first time that Hezbollah has fired towards Tel Aviv,” the Israeli military’s international spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said.  
     
 
            Shoshani described the missile as “heavy” and “long range.” 
     
            It is believed to be the first ballistic missile to ever be launched by Hezbollah toward Israel. 
     
Some background: The Iran-backed militant group’s chief, Hassan Nasrallah, had repeatedly said that any Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital would prompt a Hezbollah attack on Tel Aviv, Israel’s economic center. 
     
            No missiles fired by Hezbollah toward Israel have reached as far south as Tel Aviv during the latest escalation of tensions, nor in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. 
     
            There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries after the interception.   
     
            Hezbollah said it launched the Qadr 1 surface-to-surface ballistic missile “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza” and in “defense of Lebanon and its people.”   
     
            The Israeli military has warned displaced residents of southern Lebanon not to return to their homes as it targets militant group Hezbollah in waves of strikes. 
     
            Residents of villages in southern Lebanon began fleeing on Monday after the Israel Defense Forces warned civilians to leave areas in which Hezbollah operates, such as those used to store weapons. 
     
            “To all residents of Lebanese villages who evacuated their homes for their own safety due to the presence of weapons or elements of the terrorist Hezbollah, IDF raids continue,” The Israel Defense Forces Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, wrote on X. 
     
        “For your safety, do not return to your homes until further notice.” 
     
 
            An estimated half a million people have been displaced in Lebanon, the country’s foreign minister said Tuesday, a day after Israeli strikes killed more than 500 people across the country.
     
            The United Nations refugee agency warned on Tuesday that the number of displaced people in Lebanon is only set to rise. UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh described the situation in the country as “extremely alarming” and “very chaotic.”   
     
        “Even prior to the latest escalation, over 100,000 people had been displaced from the southern regions of Lebanon and UNHCR had intervened to support them,” he said. “That was as of over a month ago.” 
     
 
            Last week, Israel made the safe return of residents to northern Israel a war goal following nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with Hezbollah. 
     
            Hezbollah on Wednesday said it launched a ballistic missile toward the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad near Tel Aviv, shortly after the Israeli military said it intercepted the attack in what is a rare assault far from the frontlines. 
     
            The militant group said it launched a Qadr 1 ballistic missile targeting the Mossad headquarters in the suburbs of Tel Aviv “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza” and in “defense of Lebanon and its people.” 
     
            The Israeli military said earlier the missile was intercepted near Tel Aviv and that its air force struck the launcher from which it was fired in the area of Nafakhiyeh in Lebanon. 
     
            Speaking from Tel Aviv, CNN’s International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson said Israel’s interception of a missile fired from Lebanon near the city is a “very rare occurrence” and may be a first in the latest phase of escalations. 
     
            People in Tel Aviv and Netanya, a central city north of the economic center, woke up to sirens on Wednesday, Robertson said, adding that there have been no reports of casualties or any damage on the ground.
     
        “In this new phase, this new escalation of tensions and conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, this is the first that we’re aware of a missile in this phase, being intercepted, closely it appears on a trajectory towards Tel Aviv.”
     
 
            The missile launch aimed at Tel Aviv comes after two days of multiple strikes between the Israeli military and militant group Hezbollah, but those attacks mainly happened near the Israel-Lebanon border, Robertson said.
     
            A missile fired from Lebanon was intercepted near Israel’s economic center Tel Aviv on Wednesday, Israel’s military said, in a rare attack far from the front lines of the conflict with Hezbollah. 
     
        “Following the sirens that sounded in the Tel Aviv and Netanya areas, one surface-to-surface missile was identified crossing from Lebanon and was intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array,” the Israeli military said.  
     
 
            There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.  
     
            Since the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas last October, Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets and drones from Lebanon targeting northern Israel.  
     
            The intercept comes days after Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah killed more than 500 people across Lebanon. Monday was the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly two decades. 
     
            Hezbollah has not yet commented on the attempted attack on Tel Aviv.  
     
            Flights at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion international airport continued as usual, the airport’s spokesperson said. 
     
            Sirens were heard Wednesday in the central city of Netanya for the first time since October 7, according to Israeli authorities. 
     
This post has been updated with more information.
 
            The pattern of injuries among thousands wounded in Lebanon from Israeli attacks is similar to what British-Palestinian doctor Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah saw while working in Gaza. 
     
            Now working at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, Abu-Sittah said there were difficulties getting those wounded to hospital for treatment as roads were congested with people trying to flee from Israeli strikes.
     
        “We have received children with unfortunately, the same pattern of injuries that I used to see in Gaza,” Dr Abu-Sittah told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade. “Blast injuries in the face, amputations to the limbs, multiple shrapnel injuries, crushing injuries as a result of houses being demolished on top of them. So, the pattern of injuries that similar to what I had seen in Gaza in October and November last year.” 
     
 
            Dr Abu-Sittah also said the healthcare system is “very, very fragile” as it cannot cope with the influx of over 2,000 injuries in two days.
     
            Many children remain “missing under rubble” after Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, the UN children’s agency warned, as the country suffered its deadliest day since 2006.  
     
            Lebanon’s foreign minister said he was disappointed with US President Joe Biden’s remarks at the United Nations on the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, adding he believes the United States “is the only country that can really make a difference” in the region.
     
            Biden only briefly mentioned the widening of fighting in the Middle East in his final speech to the UN General Assembly, which came as cross-border strikes killed hundreds. 
     
        “It was not strong. It is not promising, and it would not solve this problem,” Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said of Biden’s speech during a virtual event hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in New York on Tuesday. 
     
 
            Referring to the war in Gaza and fears of a wider regional conflict, Bou Habib said Israel’s government “cannot survive except with wars,” and he also criticized the killing of civilians in Lebanon.
     
            An estimated half a million people have been displaced in Lebanon, Bou Habib added. 
     
            Last week, Israel made the safe return of residents to northern Israel a war goal following nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with Hezbollah.
     
Biden’s comments: “Too many on each side of the Israeli-Lebanon border remain displaced,” he said. “Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest.”
     
            While acknowledging “the situation has escalated,” he said: “a diplomatic solution is still possible.”
     
            Hezbollah on Tuesday said it targeted a naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast that houses an elite Israeli naval commando unit. 
     
            The Shayetet 13 unit that operates out of the Atlit naval base carries out “strategic sabotage activity across enemy lines, including damaging vital structures during war time and the enemy’s seaports,” according to the Israeli military. 
     
            Earlier Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said sirens were heard in the area of Atlit, south of the city of Haifa. “No injuries were reported,” the IDF said. It did not say whether the naval base was targeted.  
     
            Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel since Monday, when Israel launched strikes across Lebanon that killed more than 500 people, including women and children.The Israeli military says it is targeting the Iran-backed militant group.  
     
            Earlier Tuesday, the IDF also said it carried out another round of “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. 
     
            Hezbollah previously said it fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel overnight through Tuesday, saying it struck the Ramat David Airbase, Megiddo Airfield and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula, northern Israel. 
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed the death of one of its senior commanders, Ibrahim Qubaisi.  
     
            The militant group said in a statement Tuesday he had been “martyred on the road to Jerusalem,” a reference to those fighting to support people in Gaza, but did not elaborate.  
     
            It also said he was also known as “Abu Musa” and was born in Zebdine, in southern Lebanon, in 1962. 
     
            Earlier, the Israeli military had said Qubaisi was killed in an airstrike along with two other commanders in south Beirut. Qubaisi commanded various missile units of Hezbollah, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
     
            The British government is urging its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately as it moves roughly 700 troops to Cyprus to bolster its military presence in the Middle East.
     
            The troops are expected to arrive “in the coming hours,” according to a statement from the United Kingdom government Tuesday. 
     
        “Events in the past hours and days have demonstrated how volatile this situation is, which is why our message is clear, British nationals should leave now,” Defense Secretary John Healey said in a statement. 
     
 
            The Royal Air Force and Navy already have a presence in Cyprus with two ships stationed in the Mediterranean over the summer. 
     
            “We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British nationals should the situation deteriorate. I want to thank the British personnel who are deploying in the region for their commitment and professionalism,” Healey added. 
     
            Iran’s president told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that Israel’s recent strikes in Lebanon cannot go unanswered and warned of a potential escalation in the region. 
     
        “It is imperative that the international community should immediately stop the violence and bring about a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and bring an end to the desperate barbarism of Israel in Lebanon before it engulfs the region and the world,” Masoud Pezeshkian said.
     
 
            Israel has been striking targets associated with Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon for days, leaving hundreds dead. Dozens of the dead were women and children, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. 
     
            A day after fleeing Israel’s bombardment of southern Lebanon, one man is still shaken by what he witnessed there.
     
        “There were dead bodies strewn on the side of the road, people with their arms blown off. Even the ambulances that tried to reach them were struck,” the man, who said his name is Ali, told CNN in Beirut. 
     
 
            His elderly parents tried to calm him down and his father picked up the conversation.
     
            “Yesterday was non-stop bombardment from every direction. Barbaric and indiscriminate bombing. They have no mercy for animals, children or humans,” his father said.
     
            Asked about Israeli claims that the targets were Hezbollah positions, the father said: “They are liars. Entire families gone. These are not Hezbollah targets. We live in the south, we don’t know where Hezbollah is and I don’t know where the Hezbollah fighters are. (Israel) destroyed houses and farms instead.”
     
            Om Hussein’s family were also among the thousands who fled southern Lebanon. They spent 14 hours on the road to Beirut, stuck in congested roads, and reached the Lebanese capital at 5 a.m. local time on Tuesday. “We had no food or water, but volunteers on motorcycles distributed water to those stranded in cars,” she told CNN.
     
            “We didn’t bring anything with us, no clothes, no medicine, nothing,” her mother said, describing how quickly they fled the Israeli bombardment. The family of eight is now in one of the numerous Beirut schools sheltering the displaced.
     
            The Beirut governorate is providing shelter to about 10,000 people displaced by recent Israeli attacks on southern villages who fled to the city, Lebanese state news agency NNA reported Tuesday.
     
            Those shelters are in schools and vocational complexes in the city, the Lebanese Crisis and Disaster Management Cell said in a statement according to NNA.
     
            The Beirut municipality emphasizes ongoing efforts to provide all necessary support to the displaced individuals during this critical time. There is “cooperation with several associations that secured a number of mattresses, pillows and blankets, in addition to water, medicines and other necessary materials, so that all the supplies and materials required for all the displaced will be completed.”
     
What some aid organizations are saying: Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that it was distributing mattresses and hygiene kits to shelters in Lebanon and offering psychological and mental health support to displaced people.
     
MedGlobal, an international humanitarian aid nongovernmental organization, is also “distributing essential items,” including blankets and clothes to shelters in Beirut, Choueifat and the Baabda region, according to Dr. Tania Baban, the organization’s country director in Lebanon.
     
            The Israeli military claimed Tuesday that an airstrike that it says killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, a senior figure in Hezbollah’s missile units, also killed two other commanders of the militant group. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had earlier claimed that Qubaisi was killed in an airstrike on an apartment building in south Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday. 
     
            Qubaisi commanded various missile units of Hezbollah, according to the IDF, including the precision one. It said that “during the attack, there were other key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array” at the location. 
     
            Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has not issued death notices since Monday morning and did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. The group usually discloses the killing of its members but has not done so since the start of Israel’s intensive air campaign on Monday morning. 
     
            Speaking from Tel Aviv Tuesday evening, spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the IDF aimed to conduct its campaign against Hezbollah for as short a time as possible but was equally prepared for it to take longer.
     
            He added that “a few (Israeli) soldiers were lightly injured” in rocket attacks from Lebanon Tuesday. 
     
            A deal that would bring the remaining hostages back “should be the most important priority” of all the world leaders meeting this week at the United Nations General Assembly, Israel’s president said.
     
            Isaac Herzog told CNN on Tuesday that Israel did not want or seek a war with Lebanon but that “at the end, there is a limit to how much a nation can absorb.”  
     
        “This war was waged against us through a terror attack of the worst kind on October 7 and the day later Hezbollah started attacking us day in, day out endlessly for the last almost one year,” he said. 
     
 
            “I remind everybody we’ve gone through hell in the last year. We are fed up, we want to change the equation and we want to see a new horizon — which by the way, the Palestinians and the Arabs deserve as well, but they have been hijacked by a terrible empire of evil,” Herzog continued. 
     
            Asked whether Israel and the US were on diverging pathways regarding the situation in the region, Herzog said that Israel is “almost on the same page” with US President Joe Biden. 
     
            “Perhaps some nuances, but we are indeed, we see eye to eye with the president. We have been trying endlessly to get to an arrangement on our northern border,” he said.
     
            The Israeli military says it carried out another round of “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets in Beqaa and several areas of southern Lebanon.  
     
            “The strikes are ongoing,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
     
            It added that the air force struck Hezbollah infrastructure “in which weapons were stored, as well as dozens of launchers that were aimed toward Israeli territory.” 
     
            The IDF also said that after sirens sounded in an area near the Lebanese border, three drones were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. “Some of them were intercepted,” it said. 
     
            Later, the IDF told CNN the sirens sounded in the area of Atlit and that the impact of one of the drones caused a fire. It was extinguished and the damage was light.  
     
            “No injuries were reported,” the IDF said. The forces would not comment on whether the naval base at Atlit was targeted. 
     
            In addition, the air force was carrying out strikes on Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in Bint Jbeil, a town in southern Lebanon, after dozens of rockets were fired from the area. 
     
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops Tuesday: “Hezbollah today is different from the organization we knew a week ago — and we have additional strikes prepared.” 
     
            Gallant added that Hezbollah had “suffered a sequence of blows to its command and control, its fighters, and the means to fight. These are all severe blows.” 
     
            Speaking to troops after an exercise simulating ground combat in Lebanon, Gallant said, “You understand that the moment may come when we give an order and the system will have to move forward, so preparations must be made.”
     
This post has been updated with additional information.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hosting a security briefing with cabinet ministers and senior security officials, an Israeli official told CNN Tuesday.
     
            The meeting is centered on the security situation in northern Israel and Lebanon after Israel on Tuesday continued to exchange strikes with Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
     
            Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters Tuesday that Israel prefers a  “diplomatic solution” in Lebanon to deal with Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah but said the country would use “other methods” to show “we mean business.” 
     
        “We are not eager to start any ground invasion anywhere. I don’t want to send my son, and we don’t want to send our boys to fight in a foreign country, but we are determined to protect the civilians of Israel,” he told CNN. 
     
 
            The only way for the conflict to end will be “when Hezbollah are not on our border,” he said.
     
            The Israeli envoy also pushed back against other nations’ criticism of Israel’s war conduct at the UN, telling reporters that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s comparison of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Adolf Hitler was “beyond imagination” and “shameful.”
     
            In a speech earlier that morning, Erdogan had said, “Israel’s attitude has once again shown that it is essential for the international community to develop a protection mechanism for Palestinian civilians. Just as Hitler was stopped by the alliance of humanity 70 years ago, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by the ‘alliance of humanity.’”
     
            Doctors Without Borders is providing relief and medical assistance to people who are displaced from their homes in Lebanon.
     
            It said it is distributing things like mattresses and hygiene kits to shelters and offering psychological and mental health support, according to a statement from the organization.
     
            On Monday, Israel intensified its air campaign on Hezbollah, launching strikes targeting the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. It marked the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war and hit multiple parts of the country.
     
            Residents began to flee their homes after their phones began pinging with text messages from Israel and calls from unknown numbers urging them to evacuate immediately.
     
            There was a mass “exodus” of people trying to get out of the targeted areas, Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations General Assembly said. One Lebanese non-governmental agency said more than 100,000 people had been displaced.
     
            The organization, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said many of those people had to evacuate quickly, often without basic necessities. 
     
            MedGlobal, an international humanitarian aid nongovernmental organization, is also “distributing essential items, including 300 blankets, 600 children’s clothing items, and more, to seven school-turned-shelters in Beirut, Choueifat and the Baabda region to provide immediate relief,” according to Dr. Tania Baban, the organization’s country director in Lebanon.
     
            The system of the United Nations and the values championed by the West “are dying in Gaza” as the death toll in the enclave rises, Turkey’s president told the assembly on Tuesday amid tension in the region.
     
        “Not only children are dying in Gaza; the United Nations system is also dying, the truth is dying, the values that the West claims to defend are dying, the hopes of humanity to live in a fairer world are dying one by one,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.
     
 
            Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Erdogan condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza, where local health authority figures show that more than 41,000 people have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, following the militant group’s deadly terror attacks in Israel.  
     
            He called for world leaders to stop Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pursuit of the war, and criticized countries who support his government.  
     
            “I call out to United Nations Security Council, what are you waiting for to prevent the genocide in Gaza, to put a stop to this cruelty, this barbarianism?” he said.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Israel’s war is not with Lebanon but with Hezbollah and its leadership on Tuesday.
     
        “I say to the people of Lebanon: our war is not with you. Our war is with Hezbollah. (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah is leading you to the brink of the abyss,” Netanyahu said during a visit to an intelligence base.
     
 
            The prime minister said he warned the Lebanese people to evacuate places where Hezbollah has weapons — including residential houses.
     
            “I told you yesterday to evacuate the houses where he put a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage. He who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his garage will not have a home,” he said.
     
            Netanyahu said the militant group’s leader “causes your country to be in danger. Free yourself from the grip of Hezbollah. Free yourself from Nasrallah’s grip, for your own good.”
     
Some background: Netanyahu made similar comments on Monday, saying that his country is not at war with the people of Lebanon, but with Hezbollah. He also called on the Lebanese people to “get out of harm’s way” while it targets Hezbollah positions.  
     
            At least 30 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday, according to a local hospital and journalists in the enclave. 
     
            Among the dead were Bilal and Ousama Fayed, 20-year-old twins who were killed in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in Al-Bureij. 
     
            “They were born together and killed together,” their father Ahmad Fayed told CNN outside the mortuary at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, where their bodies had been taken. 
     
            Several children with shrapnel wounds were also brought to the hospital after the strike. Two children, 9-year-old Lama Ramadan Saidi and Zayn Hani Salama, whose age is unknown, were killed, according to the hospital where their bodies were brought. 
     
            Also in central Gaza, ten people were killed and 11 injured in a strike on a house near the Al-Ahli Club in Nuseirat, Al-Awda Hospital said. At least four of the dead were children. The Gaza Civil Defense Authority previously said six more people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Nuseirat.
     
            CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for comment on these strikes. It is unclear what the Israeli military had been targeting. Central Gaza has been the scene of intense Israeli onslaught.  
     
            Six civilians were also killed in Khan Younis, in the early hours of Tuesday, according to the Civil Defense Authority. The IDF told CNN that in that case, it was targeting a Hamas commander. 
     
            Further north in Al Tawam, four people were killed, including a driver for the Civil Defense Directorate, when an airstrike hit an apartment, according to local journalists. 
     
            As Israel continues to conduct strikes on Lebanon, world leaders are reacting to the recent attacks that killed more than 500 people and wounded thousands. 
     
            Here’s what some world leaders are saying: 
     
            President Joe Biden on Tuesday lamented the death toll and pain felt by innocent civilians on both sides of the Israel-Gaza conflict while speaking at the UN General Assembly.
     
            Biden referenced the hundreds of civilians killed during the Hamas attack on Israel 11 months ago and the scores who were taken hostage. “I’ve met with the families of those hostages. I’ve grieved with them,” Biden said. “They’re going through hell.”
     
            He added: “Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell. Thousands and thousands killed, including aid workers. Too many families dislocated, crowding in the tents, facing a dire humanitarian situation.”
     
            On the languishing ceasefire deal, Biden said: “Now is the time for the parties to finalize its terms, bring the hostages home and secure security for Israel and Gaza free of Hamas scrip, ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war.”
     
            The Israeli military has claimed that a senior Hezbollah commander in charge of the group’s missile unit was killed in an airstrike on an apartment building in south Beirut Tuesday. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) identified the commander as Ibrahim Qubaisi and added that “during the attack, there were other key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket array” at the location.
     
            Qubaisi commanded various missile units of Hezbollah, including the precision missile units, the IDF said.
     
        “Over the years and during the war, he was responsible for the launches towards Israel,” describing him as “a center of knowledge in the field of missiles and was close to the senior military leadership of Hezbollah.”
     
 
            The IDF claimed that “as part of his duties in the terrorist organization, he was responsible for the planning and execution of many terrorist plots against IDF forces” and Israeli citizens.
     
            The strike demolished two upper stories of the building in Beirut. Hezbollah has yet to comment on any high-profile casualties as a result of the strike.
     
            Several teachers were among the 558 people killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Monday, the minister for education said Tuesday.
     
            Math teacher Layali Ayyash was killed, alongside her husband and two children, Dr. Abbas Al-Halabi posted to Facebook.
 
            Suzy Kajak, the principal of the Kawthariya Al-Sayyad Intermediate School, and sisters Zainab and Fatima Haribi — both teachers — at Shokin Official school, were also killed in the strikes, the minister confirmed.
     
            Al-Halabi “offered his sincere condolences to their families, schools, colleagues and students and asked God to have mercy on them,” the post read.
     
            Two staff members of the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) were among the 558 people killed in Lebanon on Monday, the organization’s chief confirmed on Tuesday.
     
            Dina Darwiche was killed alongside her youngest son when an Israeli missile struck the building they lived in on Monday, the agency told CNN. She worked for the UN for 12 years in Beqaa.
     
            Darwiche’s husband and one of her children were rescued and are in hospital receiving treatment for “serious injuries,” it added.
     
            Ali Basma, the other staff member killed by the strikes, had worked for the UN for seven years in Tyre, a coastal town south of Beirut. Basma was buried on Tuesday morning.
     
            “UNHCR is outraged by the killing of our colleagues, and we extend our deepest sympathies to their families and loved ones,” it said.
     
            In a post to X, UNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi took aim at Israeli airstrikes which he said were “relentlessly claiming hundreds of civilian lives.”
     
        “On behalf of all us at UNHCR, heartfelt condolences to their families, friends and colleagues,” he added.
     
 
            At least six people were killed and 15 were injured by an Israeli strike in the area of Ghobeiry in Beirut’s southern suburbs, according to the Lebanon’s health ministry. 
     
            The ministry said this was a preliminary update and suggested the number of casualties could still rise.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for additional information on the strike in Beirut but it has yet to hear back.
     
            In the past, the IDF has used strikes on the capital Beirut to kill senior Hezbollah figures. This is the fifth Israeli strike in Beirut’s Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs this year.
     
            Israel launched an intense barrage of airstrikes across swathes of Lebanon on Monday in what was the deadliest day for the country since at least the 2006 war fought between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.
     
            Terror and despair gripped Lebanese residents as Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others, authorities said, as residents fled their homes desperate to reach safety.
     
            Here’s a map showing where the strikes occurred in Lebanon: 
     
CNN’s Helen Regan contributed reporting to this post. 
 
            The number of displaced people in Lebanon is only set to rise, the UN refugee agency warned on Tuesday, after tens of thousands fled their homes in recent days.
     
            UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh described the displacement situation in Lebanon as “extremely alarming” and “very chaotic.”  
     
        “In terms of the displacement of people, we’re looking at tens of thousands, but we expect that those figures will start to rise,” Saltmarsh told a UN briefing. 
     
 
            As large number of civilians flock to Beirut and surrounding areas from southern Lebanon, the UNHCR is looking to ensure there is sufficient water and sanitation facilities in shelters, Saltmarsh said.
     
            The UN is also on standby to expand humanitarian assistance in areas in the Beqaa Valley where the Israeli military on Monday issued evacuation warnings.
     
        “Even prior to the latest escalation, over 100,000 people had been displaced from the southern regions of Lebanon and UNHCR had intervened to support them. That was as of over a month ago,” Saltmarsh added.  
     
 
            Lebanon already had more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees in the country alongside 87,000 others in the south of the country, Saltmarsh said, highlighting how many of these people are now going through “double displacement.”  
     
            Lebanon has been thrown into chaos as Israel continues its attacks on what it says are Hezbollah positions across its northern neighbor’s territory. 
     
            Footage shared on social media showed long lines of traffic as people tried to flee southern Lebanon — which has been subjected to an intense Israeli bombardment, more so than other parts of the country — toward the capital Beirut. 
     
            Traveling from southern Lebanon towards Beirut usually takes 90 minutes, at most, but massive traffic jams have stretched that to 12 hours or more, according to several witnesses CNN spoke with. 
     
            Desperate scenes could also be seen at border crossings between Lebanon and Syria, as hundreds of vehicles were seen clogging up the roads on the Lebanese side.  
     
            The Israeli military has carried out an airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and witness reports.  
     
            The IDF described the attack as a “targeted strike,” promising more details at a later stage. Lebanese state news agency NNA said the strike had hit a five-story building in the Ghobeiry neighborhood of Beirut’s southern suburbs, destroying apartments on the fourth and fifth floors. 
     
            A photo distributed by Hezbollah’s media office showed the top two floors of a building destroyed by the Israeli strike. 
     
            A CNN team at a hospital nearby said they could hear sirens as first responders rushed to the scene.  
     
            Many children remain “missing under rubble” and caught “on dangerous roads” after Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, the UN children’s agency warned, as the country suffered its deadliest day since 2006.  
     
            More children were killed in Lebanon in one day on Monday than in the entire past year, Ettie Higgins, UNICEF Deputy Representative for Lebanon Ettie Higgins told a UN briefing Tuesday.  
     
            UNICEF has received reports that many Lebanese children “slept in cars and on the sides of roads” on Monday night after thousands of families were displaced from their homes in southern Lebanon, Higgins said.  
     
        “We’re also getting reports that hundreds of children are caught en route across dangerous roads across the country,” she added.  
     
 
            The agency was also asked for the first time on Monday to provide mobile mortuary vehicles to store the remains of children, Higgins added.  
     
            “If we return to a conflict like those dark days of 2006, we really fear as UNICEF that this time, it could be even worse for the children of Lebanon,” Higgins stressed.  
     
            The Israeli military has vowed to “speed up the offensive operations” after it launched extensive airstrikes targeting the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
        “Hezbollah must not be given a reprieve,” Herzi Halevi, Chief of the General Staff, said according to an Israel Defense Forces statement. “Keep working with full force. We will speed up the offensive operations today and tighten all the formations. The situation requires continued vigorous action in all arenas.”
     
 
            Israel on Tuesday has continued striking Lebanon. At least 558 people have been killed, including 50 children and 94 women, by Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Monday, the country’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said.  
     
            CNN’s Sarah El Sirgany is at the Rafik Hariri hospital in Beirut, where dozens of injured people are arriving for treatment after Israel launched airstrikes targeting the militant group Hezbollah.
     
            This is how she describes what she is seeing:
     
        “A family has arrived in a sedan carrying a young man with bandaged leg. As he is taken to the triage zone, a relative tells us they have been on the road from Tyre to Beirut since Monday afternoon.” 
     
 
            Tyre is a coastal city south of Beirut.
     
            Hospitals in Beirut have been treating some of those injured in the strikes down south, and Rafic Hariri director Jihad Saadeh told the CNN team that ambulances took hours on the road due to traffic, including one carrying an intubated patient. 
     
            At least 558 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes on Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said. 
     
        “We remain in the war and remain in the throes of the attacks. Our responsibilities have not ended,” Abiad added as Israel continued its attacks on Tuesday.  
     
 
            Among those killed were four first responders, Abiad said, adding that 14 ambulances and firetrucks had been hit by Israeli forces.  
     
            In total, 1,835 people were wounded by the strikes in one day alone.  
     
            Israeli strikes have also forced thousands of people to flee their homes, especially in southern Lebanon. The number of people displaced in the country over the last 24 hours, from areas affected by Israeli strikes, has reached 16,500, Nasser Yassine, the Lebanese coordinator of government’s emergency preparedness, told CNN Tuesday.   
     
            Yassine said 150 schools are being used to house displaced people across Lebanon.  
     
Correction: This post has been corrected to clarify that the toll included only Monday’s deaths.
 
            Israel says its air force has concluded a “second wave” of strikes on Hezbollah positions, some deep in Lebanon, on Tuesday. 
     
        “A short while ago, with the direction of IDF intelligence, the [Israeli Air Force] struck terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the Beqaa and several areas in southern Lebanon,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Tuesday. “Among the targets struck were buildings in which weapons were stored, command centers, and additional terrorist infrastructure sites,” it claimed, adding that secondary explosions were identified, which indicated “large amounts of weapons were stored in the buildings.” 
     
 
            Lebanon saw its deadliest day in nearly two decades on Monday after Israel launched airstrikes targeting Hezbollah across the country. The nearly 500 people killed on Monday alone, including dozens of children, is roughly half the number of Lebanese killed during the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. It is unclear how many of the casualties were Hezbollah militants. 
     
            The Israeli military’s Arabic media spokesperson has told “residents of Lebanese villages” used by Hezbollah to evacuate.
     
            Yesterday, evacuation warnings were issued to residents of villages in the Beqaa valley. 
     
            Avichay Adraee said Tuesday that airstrikes were ongoing across the country, warning that: 
     
        “If you are near or inside buildings used by Hezbollah or those used for storing weapons, you must move at least one kilometer away or immediately leave the village,” he said. “Anyone near Hezbollah personnel is putting themselves at risk.”
     
 
            About 100 projectiles, including rockets, have been launched by Hezbollah toward Israel since midnight, an Israeli military spokesperson told CNN. 
     
            Most of the rockets seemed to be targeting the Lower Galilee and HaAmakim areas of northern Israel. 
     
            The military also said most projectiles were intercepted but that “damage was caused to building in the area.” 
     
            Israel Fire and Rescue Services crews could be seen working to extinguish fires caused by the strikes in video released earlier today. 
     
            The Israeli military, meanwhile, is continuing to strike Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. 
     
            The Israeli military says it is continuing to strike Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.
     
        “In the last hour, Air Force fighter jets attacked terrorist targets of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, including launchers, military structures, and buildings where weapons were stored,” it said. 
     
 
            The military also shared a grainy drone video of what it said was a Hezbollah launcher it targeted in the vicinity of Houmine El Faouqa. 
     
            CNN could not independently verify the target or its location.  
     
            Hezbollah said it fired a barrage of rockets at the city of Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel on Tuesday. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said 50 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. The majority were intercepted, but some damaged buildings in the area. 
     
            Several fires broke out following the barrage, including a fire in a storage facility and another that broke out in an open area, Israel Fire and Rescue Services said. 
     
            An Israeli police spokesperson said there were no reports of injuries after the rocket fire.  
     
Waves of strikes: Hezbollah’s barrage came shortly after the Israeli military began another round of airstrikes in eastern and southern Lebanon.
     
            Earlier today, Israel’s military said it struck “dozens” of targets in Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it had fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel in the early hours of this morning, targeting the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel.  
     
            At least 40 flights in and out of Beirut’s main airport, Rafic Hariri, have been canceled, as of Tuesday morning. 
     
            The hub’s website showed the cancelations, although not all were immediately visible on airport information boards.
     
            Most of those canceled were going to or arriving from Germany, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Turkey, Ethiopia, Switzerland, France, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, and Qatar.
     
            Lebanese aviation authorities have denied reports of full flight suspensions and clarified that certain airlines chose to pause operations to Beirut due to the Israeli strikes in recent days. 
     
            Qatar Airways, EgyptAir, Tarom and Lufthansa are among those that have suspended flights to Lebanon. Air France also announced Tuesday morning that it would not run any flights to or from Beirut until October 1 “due to the security situation locally,” according to a statement.
     
This post has been updated with additional information.
 
            The Israeli military has started another round of airstrikes in eastern Lebanon, the Lebanese state news agency NNA reported Tuesday.  
     
        “Hostile airstrikes resumed on Baalbek and its surrounding areas, targeting Al-Tal Al-Abyad district at the northern entrance of Baalbek, the town of Talia, and the outskirts of Shamstar,” NNA said. 
     
 
            NNA also reported that Israel had targeted a bridge in southern Lebanon.  
     
        “Al-Mahmoudiya, near Al-Aishiya in the Jezzine area, is being subjected to several airstrikes, especially targeting the bridge separating the regions of Jezzine and Marjeyoun,” NNA said.  
     
 
            Israel’s military said earlier on Tuesday it had struck “dozens” of targets in Lebanon after Hezbollah launched multiple rocket barrages. 
     
            Hezbollah said it fired rockets into northern Israel overnight and that it struck the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel. 
     
            Lebanon saw its deadliest day in nearly two decades yesterday after Israel launched airstrikes targeting the militant group Hezbollah across the country.
     
            The nearly 500 people killed on Monday alone, including dozens of children, is roughly half the number of Lebanese killed during the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. It is unclear how many of the casualties were Hezbollah militants.
     
            Israeli’s military said it struck 1,600 Hezbollah assets, including “cruise missiles,” rockets, and explosive warheads — and that the munitions were stored in civilian homes. 
     
            Residents began to flee their homes after receiving text messages from Israel and calls from unknown numbers urging them to evacuate. A Lebanese radio station said it was hacked and its broadcast interrupted by an Israeli evacuation warning.  
     
Why is Israel attacking Lebanon?
 
            Hezbollah and Israel have been in conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up cross-border attacks since the war in Gaza began following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel.
     
            Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began.  
     
            Israel’s recent escalation in attacks executes its new war objective: to return displaced residents evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks to their homes near the northern border.
     
            Israel has not ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion into Lebanon.
     
Are Lebanon and Israel at war?
 
            Netanyahu has told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah.
     
            The US believes that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, but a major concern is that Iran, a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, US officials told CNN.
     
            Iran has warned Israel of “dangerous consequences” following the strikes, with Iran’s president telling CNN on Monday that it risks tipping the region into wider conflict.
     
Read the full story.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the security cabinet on Monday that the country’s aim in its military operations in Lebanon is to cut “Hezbollah from the war with Hamas,” an Israeli official told CNN.  
     
            The same official said the cabinet has agreed to continue to raise the level of military operations every day. Israel is aware of the risks, the source said, and is ready to stop at any moment. “It is up to Hezbollah,” the source said.  
     
            Herzi Halevi, Israel’s Chief of Staff, indicated on Monday that the military was “preparing for the next phases.” Halevi said he would elaborate on those next steps soon. 
     
            Israel’s military said it struck “dozens” of targets in Lebanon after Hezbollah launched multiple barrages on Tuesday, marking the latest cross-border attacks in their most intense confrontation in nearly two decades.
     
            The Israeli military said about 30 rockets had been launched by Hezbollah toward Israel since midnight, and that it responded to the strikes with air and artillery attacks. The rockets were launched over four barrages, it said. 
     
            The Israeli Air Force struck “dozens of Hezbollah targets in numerous areas in southern Lebanon,” including strikes on the militants and rocket launchers that were used to target HaAmakim, an area near the northern Israeli city of Haifa, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.  
     
            The IDF also said artillery and tanks had struck targets in the areas of the towns Ayta ash Shab and Ramyeh in southern Lebanon. 
     
            In the early hours of Tuesday, Hezbollah said it had fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel targeting the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel.   
     
            Hezbollah’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the militant group and Israel have seen near-daily clashes since the war in Gaza began.
     
Here’s what to know about their decades-long conflict
 
Israeli invasion: Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory when it invaded in 1982. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation led to the deaths of over 17,000 people, according to reports and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at a Beirut refugee camp. The investigation held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the Christian Lebanese fighters.  
     
The rise of Hezbollah: As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by Iran burst onto the scene. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel and civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
Support for Gaza: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has increasingly clashed with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started — and has vowed to continue until the war ends. 
     
Killing of key leader: Tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, with a strike on Beirut in July. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles into Israel. 
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both Israel and Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. More than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon.
     
            Israel’s extensive strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon are “a human and humanitarian crisis” that risks tipping the region into wider conflict, Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview.
     
        “The danger does exist that the fire of events that are taking place (in Lebanon) will expand to the entire region,” Pezeshkian said. 
     
 
            Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the Middle East’s most powerful paramilitary forces. The US believes, however, that Israel has significantly weakened the group in strikes over the last week. 
     
            Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began.
     
            When asked whether Iran will counsel Hezbollah to restrain itself in its response to Israeli strikes, Pezeshkian said Hezbollah is facing a country “armed to the teeth and has access to weapons systems that are far superior to anything else.” 
     
        “We must not allow for Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel,” he warned. “Hezbollah cannot do that alone. Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, European countries, and the United States of America.”
     
 
            Pezeshkian spoke with CNN as world leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday, in which hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon are expected to dominate the discussion agenda.
     
        Pezeshkian warned that events could spiral into a regional conflict, which “can be dangerous for the future of the world and planet Earth itself, so we must prevent the ongoing criminal acts being committed by Israel.” 
     
 
            Jordan’s King Abdullah II has affirmed his country’s “absolute support for Lebanon, its security, sovereignty, and the safety of its citizens in the face of Israel’s war on it,” Jordan’s state news agency, Petra, reported.  
     
            Abdullah II was speaking to Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday as the country was reeling from Israeli strikes that killed almost 500 people.  
     
        The king “warned of the danger of Israeli escalation, stressing the need for international efforts” to prevent a regional war, Petra reported, adding that it all starts with “an immediate end to the war on Gaza.”  
     
 
            Abdullah II, the agency reported, called on the international community to stand with Lebanon and “protect innocent civilians,” and take immediate and serious measures to “end all forms of escalation in the region.”  
     
            The US believes Israel has significantly weakened Hezbollah over the last week but is still working feverishly behind the scenes to convince the country not to escalate further and launch a ground incursion into Lebanon, officials told CNN.
     
        “We are the closest we’ve been to spiraling to a regional war” since Hamas’ October 7 attack, one of the officials said.
     
 
            Hezbollah began launching drone and rocket attacks against Israel a day later, sparking months of hostilities across what had been Israel’s quietest border for years. The conflict escalated last week when Israel carried out  attacks that detonated Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. 
     
            Israel then launched strikes on Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, killing hundreds of civilians and Hezbollah leaders. The group has responded with rocket attacks targeting Israeli sites.
     
            The US assesses that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, officials said. But a senior State Department official has expressed skepticism about Israel’s strategy.
     
        “I can’t recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation,” the State Department said Monday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
     
 
            The biggest concern right now is that Iran, which is a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, the first official said. Tehran has not intervened yet, but they will if they believe they are about to lose their most powerful proxy force, Hezbollah, the official added.
     
Read the full story.
 
            Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah has fired a fresh barrage of strikes into northern Israel, a day after Israeli airstrikes targeting the militant group in Lebanon killed nearly 500 people and wounded 1,600 others — the country’s deadliest day in nearly two decades. 
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck in tit-for-tat escalation since the war in Gaza began. But over the past week, Israel’s escalated attacks on the group have again heightened fears of a wider regional war. 
     
Here’s what to know:  
 
            Hezbollah fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel overnight, a day after the Israeli military escalated its attacks on the Iran-backed group and launched airstrikes in Lebanon.  
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel.  
     
            About 20 “projectiles” were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli airspace between 2:39 a.m. and 3:11 a.m. local time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Tuesday. 
     
            Some of the projectiles had been intercepted while others had fallen in open areas, the IDF said, without specifying where they had fallen. 
     
            The Israeli Air Force responded by striking the sources of the rocket fire.
     
            It came after warning sirens blared in the HaAmakim area, southeast of the northern Israeli city of Haifa.  
     
            Israel’s emergency response service, Magen David Adom (MDA), said it dispatched teams to search areas in the Lower Galilee, where reports of rocket fire were received.  
     
            “At this stage, no injuries have been reported,” MDA spokesperson Zaki Heller said.  
     
            MDA said the windows of one of its ambulances in the Jezreel Valley were damaged from a blast wave.  
     
Some background: The Amos base, inaugurated in 2021, serves as a transport and logistics hub for the Israeli military’s Northern Command. It also is “the central axis” for the IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate, which is responsible for multi-agency logistics and emergency preparedness in the northern front, according to the IDF. 
     
            Lebanon may be no stranger to conflict. But Monday was the deadliest day the country has seen in a generation.  
     
            Israel’s aerial bombardment killed nearly 500 people, including at least 35 children and 58 women, according to Lebanese authorities.
     
            That’s nearly half the number killed throughout the entire 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.  
     
            That conflict was savage. I still remember the stench of victims decomposing in refrigerator trucks because it was too dangerous to transport bodies out while Israeli attack drones and fighter jets patrolled overhead.  
     
            When the fighting finally stopped, around 1,100 Lebanese people had been killed. On the Israeli side, 21 Israeli soldiers and 43 civilians were killed.  
     
Fighting in the shadows: On the battlefield, Hezbollah’s fighters must be an infuriating enemy. They fought an Israeli ground incursion to a standstill in 2006. But throughout the war, I didn’t see a single armed Hezbollah fighter, such is their ability to blend in.  
     
            The Iran-backed group operates as a “state within a state” in a bitterly divided country with a borderline bankrupt government that has no president, where neighborhoods still bear the scars of a 15-year civil war.  
     
            Lebanese civilians know all too well how frightening the Israeli military’s attempts to target Hezbollah can be.  
     
            On Friday, Israeli jets carried out an airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs, in which they killed several senior Hezbollah commanders. But the missiles also destroyed a nine-story building in a densely populated neighborhood, killing 45 people, including women and children.  
     
            The Israeli military accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields.  
     
Families flee: But that is little consolation to Lebanese citizens like my mother-in-law, who was a block and a half away from the building the Israeli jets destroyed. For several hours, my family struggled to evacuate my wife’s grandmother — a stroke victim who could not walk out of her apartment.  
     
            Like the exodus of panicked civilians who fled the Israeli bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon on Monday, my in-laws have taken shelter in another neighborhood.  
     
            Four generations are now gathered in a single apartment, including a week-old newborn, aunts and uncles who work as teachers and building contractors. They have no connection whatsoever with Hezbollah.    
     
            We hope and pray that their neighborhood will not be bombed.  
     
            France has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to address the strikes in Lebanon, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the UN General Assembly on Monday.
     
            Barrot called for de-escalation and a halt to strikes being carried out across the region.
     
            “France, once again, calls upon the parties and those that support them to de-escalate and avoid a regional conflagration that would be devastating for everyone, first and foremost, the civilian population,” Barrot said.
     
            “For that reason, I have asked for an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Lebanon this week. In Lebanon as elsewhere, France will remain fully mobilized to resolve major crisis that are disrupting the international agenda,” Barrot said. 
     
            Panic and fear have gripped Lebanon as displaced people flee their homes, taking along with them frightened children to shelter at schools, according to videos of the destruction caused by the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in the country since 2006
     
            Fatma Ibrahim Shehab was among several people who had taken shelter at a school in the coastal city of Sidon after being evacuated from southern Lebanon following consecutive days of Israeli strikes. 
     
            She told the AFP news agency she had to leave after an Israeli strike next to her home left her building shaking. 
     
            “We got very stressed, this is why we had to leave and we came here. We were told it’s safe here. The situation is very tragic, the strikes were right next to us,” she said.
     
            Mohamed Hamayda, a Syrian man displaced from Deir al-Zahrani, told the news agency he had no choice but to take his mother and the rest of his family on public transport to the Kuwaiti school in Sidon after being told it had opened as a shelter. 
     
        “We have nowhere to go, we have nothing,” he said. 
     
 
            And Hassan Banjak said he had reluctantly fled the village of Chaaitiyeh. 
     
            “Since the war and bombings with the Israeli enemy began, we hadn’t left. But after the strikes intensified and got closer, the children got scared, so we decided to leave. If it wasn’t for the children I would have never left,” he said. 
     
Scale of destruction: Their accounts came as Reuters video footage from the southern suburbs of Beirut showed debris from damaged buildings and shards of glass littering the ground after Israel’s deadly wave of strikes on Monday. 
     
            One video showed a car with rubble on its windshield, in front of a building with shattered windows. Another video, from Zahle, which is east of Beirut in the Bekaa governorate, showed plumes of smoke rising in the distance. 
     
            An eyewitness video verified by CNN, which appears to have been taken from a balcony in the Bekaa governorate, shows smoke rising in what appears to be a multi-story residential compound.
     
            The person filming can be heard saying, “This is right outside our house. This is right outside our house.”  
     
            UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged Monday for the immediate cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, his spokesperson said, as world leaders prepare to meet Tuesday for the UN General Assembly. 
     
        “There is no military solution that will make either side safer,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a briefing. 
     
 
            He said Guterres was alarmed by the escalating situation and the “large number of civilian casualties” being reported by Lebanese authorities, and expressed the urgent need for de-escalation and for all efforts to be devoted to a diplomatic solution. 
     
        “With the wellbeing of civilians on both sides of the Blue Line and the stability of the region at stake, space must be given for diplomatic efforts to succeed,” Dujarric said, referring to the buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon.
     
 
            In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria aired Sunday, the UN Secretary-General warned that Lebanon could transform into “another Gaza.”
     
        “There is a potential for a much stronger escalation. And that is what concerns me - the possibility of transforming Lebanon in[to] another Gaza, which I think would be a devastating tragedy for the world,” Guterres told CNN. 
     
 
More context: World leaders are gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday after Lebanon saw the deadliest day of strikes from Israel in the country since the 2006 war. It came after a weekend of bombings between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, contributing to the most intense exchanges of fire between the two sides since October 7.  
     
            Wars of peace are rarely successful. They are normally of choice: pre-emptively attacking to neutralize a perceived threat. Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck in the tit-for-tat horror of escalation chicken for nearly a year. 
     
            But over the past week Israel has clearly decided to massively amplify its attacks on the Iran-backed militant group, claiming, according to some reports, they seek to “escalate to deescalate” – to cow their adversary into a diplomatic solution.
     
            It is a highly risky and likely flawed mantra, perhaps designed to dupe their frustrated ally, the United States, into believing that the diplomatic solution, which Washington has now sunk an almost embarrassing amount of energy into, is still also Israel’s goal.
     
            But the greater the harm inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the more likely a shorter-term Israeli success has seemed. 
     
            A full-scale ground war between a tired, divided Israeli military and an experienced, angry Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon would likely be disastrous for Israel. It is exactly what the militant group is good at and waiting for. Yet it is also something Israel does not for now need to get into.
     
Read the full analysis. 
 
Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed nearly 500 people and wounded 1,600 others on Monday — the deadliest day in the country since the Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006 — but neither side is calling the current escalation a war.
     
            Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Leon Panetta told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the situation has “crossed a threshold.”
     
        “We’re clearly walking into a much wider war. And that makes it much more difficult for any of the parties to agree to any kind of solution.”
     
 
            Panetta said there’s no doubt world leaders gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly this week will be “talking an awful lot about the war that’s taking place now between Israel and Hezbollah and the fact that it’s become a wider war.”
     
            He added the US must make clear there cannot be “an all-out war in the Middle East.”
     
            “Obviously, the United States is going to continue to provide those supplies as we have because of our bond with Israel, but at the same time that it’s important to make clear that we cannot have an all-out war in the Middle East. Right now, this is the wrong time or the wrong place and frankly, everybody is going to pay a price that I think will be devastating in terms of the future.”
     
            The rapidly escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon is further threatening President Joe Biden’s efforts to reduce tension in the Middle East, leaving the president with ever-diminishing options to secure a ceasefire-and-hostage deal that has become his top priority in the final months of his presidency.
     
            As he prepares for his final high-profile speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, the crisis is overshadowing any attempt at burnishing his foreign policy legacy. Without any near-term hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza, Biden is facing new questions about his approach to the nearly year-long conflict.
 
            White House officials watched with concern over the weekend as Israeli warplanes struck targets in Lebanon while Hezbollah fired rockets and drones into northern Israel. As Biden was meeting Asia-Pacific leaders in Delaware, the crisis was unfolding in a different part of the world. The president and his aides were closely monitoring the situation from Wilmington.
     
            Biden’s aides currently view the risk of escalation as serious and real, and have been communicating daily with officials in Israel, officials said Monday.

            Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah has fired a fresh barrage of strikes into northern Israel, a day after Israeli airstrikes targeting the militant group in Lebanon killed nearly 500 people and wounded 1,600 others — the country’s deadliest day in nearly two decades. 
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck in tit-for-tat escalation since the war in Gaza began. But over the past week, Israel’s escalated attacks on the group have again heightened fears of a wider regional war. 
     
Here’s what to know:  
 
            Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has slammed Israel’s deadly airstrikes in Lebanon, saying that he and his government “strongly condemn acts that violate basic norms of international order.”
     
            Wang told his Lebanon counterpart on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly that “China resolutely supports Lebanon in maintaining its sovereignty, security, and national dignity,” according to a foreign ministry readout published on Tuesday.  
     
        “We pay close attention to developments in the region, especially the communication device explosion attacks recently, and we resolutely oppose indiscriminate attacks against civilians,” Wang said. 
     
 
China’s role in the Middle East: Since the start of the war in Gaza, China – which has looked to bolster its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years – has presented itself as a voice for countries across decrying Israel’s war in the enclave and calling for Palestinian statehood.
     
            Lebanon may be no stranger to conflict. But Monday was the deadliest day the country has seen in a generation.  
     
            Israel’s aerial bombardment killed nearly 500 people, including at least 35 children and 58 women, according to Lebanese authorities.
     
            That’s nearly half the number killed throughout the entire 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.   
     
            That conflict was savage. I still remember the stench of victims decomposing in refrigerator trucks because it was too dangerous to transport bodies out while Israeli attack drones and fighter jets patrolled overhead.  
     
            When the fighting finally stopped, around 1,100 Lebanese people had been killed.  On the Israeli side, 21 Israeli soldiers and 43 civilians were killed.  
     
Fighting in the shadows: On the battlefield, Hezbollah’s fighters must be an infuriating enemy. They fought an Israeli ground incursion to a standstill in 2006. But throughout the war, I didn’t see a single armed Hezbollah fighter, such is their ability to blend in.  
     
            The Iran-backed group operates as a “state within a state” in a bitterly divided country with a borderline bankrupt government that has no president, where neighborhoods still bear the scars of a 15-year civil war.  
     
            Lebanese civilians know all too well how frightening the Israeli military’s attempts to target Hezbollah can be.   
     
            On Friday, Israeli jets carried out an airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs, in which they killed several senior Hezbollah commanders. But the missiles also destroyed a nine-story building in a densely populated neighborhood, killing 45 people, including women and children.  
     
            The Israeli military accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields.  
     
Families flee: But that is little consolation to Lebanese citizens like my mother-in-law, who was a block and a half away from the building the Israeli jets destroyed. For several hours, my family struggled to evacuate my wife’s grandmother — a stroke victim who could not walk out of her apartment.  
     
            Like the exodus of panicked civilians who fled the Israeli bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon on Monday, my in-laws have taken shelter in another neighborhood.  
     
            Four generations are now gathered in a single apartment, including a week-old newborn, aunts and uncles who work as teachers and building contractors. They have no connection whatsoever with Hezbollah.    
     
            We hope and pray that their neighborhood will not be bombed.  
     
            Hezbollah fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel overnight, a day after the Israeli military escalated its attacks on the Iran-backed group and launched airstrikes in Lebanon.  
     
            Hezbollah said it had targeted the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel.  
     
            About 20 “projectiles” were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli airspace between 2:39 a.m. and 3:11 a.m. local time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Tuesday. 
     
            Some of the projectiles had been intercepted while others had fallen in open areas, the IDF said, without specifying where they had fallen. 
     
            The Israeli Air Force responded by striking the sources of the rocket fire.
     
            It came after warning sirens blared in the HaAmakim area, southeast of the northern Israeli city of Haifa.  
     
            Israel’s emergency response service, Magen David Adom (MDA), said it dispatched teams to search areas in the Lower Galilee, where reports of rocket fire were received.  
     
        “At this stage, no injuries have been reported,” MDA spokesperson Zaki Heller said.  
     
 
            MDA said the windows of one of its ambulances in the Jezreel Valley were damaged from a blast wave.  
     
Some background: The Amos base, inaugurated in 2021, serves as a transport and logistics hub for the Israeli military’s Northern Command. It also is “the central axis” for the IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate, which is responsible for multi-agency logistics and emergency preparedness in the northern front, according to the IDF.  
     
            Qatar and Egypt have condemned the wave of Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, which killed more than 450 people and injured thousands, warning the attacks increase the risk of a “regional war.” 
     
        “The State of Qatar condemns, in the strongest terms, the Israeli aggression on Lebanon,” Qatar’s Foreign Ministry said, and cautioned “against expanding the circle of violence in the region.” “This reality exacerbates crises, puts the region on the brink of the abyss, and exposes it to more tensions that will have a profound impact regionally and internationally,” the ministry said.
     
 
            Egypt expressed its solidarity with Lebanon and affirmed its “categorical rejection” of any violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty and its territories. 
     
        “Egypt has previously warned of the gravity of the continued Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip, and the danger of its expansion, which puts the region at risk of sliding into a full-fledged regional war,” its statement said. 
     
 
            Both countries called for urgent international diplomatic pressure to de-escalate the widening conflict and expressed their readiness to support efforts to achieve regional peace and stability.  
     
More context: Qatar and Egypt, along with the US, have been mediating talks between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages held by the militant group.
     
            More than 450 people were killed and 1,600 others were injured in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon on Monday, marking the deadliest day in the country since the Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006 — but neither side is calling the current escalation a war.
     
            Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Leon Panetta told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the situation has “crossed a threshold.” 
     
        “We’re clearly walking into a much wider war. And that makes it much more difficult for any of the parties to agree to any kind of solution.”
     
 
            Panetta said there’s no doubt world leaders gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly this week will be “talking an awful lot about the war that’s taking place now between Israel and Hezbollah and the fact that it’s become a wider war.”
     
            He added the US must make clear there cannot be “an all-out war in the Middle East.”
     
        “Obviously, the United States is going to continue to provide those supplies as we have because of our bond with Israel, but at the same time that it’s important to make clear that we cannot have an all-out war in the Middle East. Right now, this is the wrong time or the wrong place and frankly, everybody is going to pay a price that I think will be devastating in terms of the future.”
     
 
            France has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to address the strikes in Lebanon, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the UN General Assembly on Monday.
     
            Barrot called for de-escalation and a halt to strikes being carried out across the region.
     
        “France, once again, calls upon the parties and those that support them to de-escalate and avoid a regional conflagration that would be devastating for everyone, first and foremost, the civilian population,” Barrot said.
     
 
            “For that reason, I have asked for an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Lebanon this week. In Lebanon as elsewhere, France will remain fully mobilized to resolve major crisis that are disrupting the international agenda,” Barrot said. 
     
            UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged Monday for the immediate cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, his spokesperson said, as world leaders prepare to meet Tuesday for the UN General Assembly. 
     
        “There is no military solution that will make either side safer,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a briefing. 
     
 
            He said Guterres was alarmed by the escalating situation and the “large number of civilian casualties” being reported by Lebanese authorities, and expressed the urgent need for de-escalation and for all efforts to be devoted to a diplomatic solution. 
     
        “With the wellbeing of civilians on both sides of the Blue Line and the stability of the region at stake, space must be given for diplomatic efforts to succeed,” Dujarric said, referring to the buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon.
     
 
            In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria aired Sunday, the UN Secretary-General warned that Lebanon could transform into “another Gaza.”
     
        “There is a potential for a much stronger escalation. And that is what concerns me - the possibility of transforming Lebanon in[to] another Gaza, which I think would be a devastating tragedy for the world,” Guterres told CNN. 
     
 
More context: World leaders are gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday after Lebanon saw the deadliest day of strikes from Israel in the country since the 2006 war. It came after a weekend of bombings between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, contributing to the most intense exchanges of fire between the two sides since October 7. 
     
            Panic and fear have gripped Lebanon as displaced people flee their homes, taking along with them frightened children to shelter at schools, according to videos of the destruction caused by the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in the country since 2006
     
            Fatma Ibrahim Shehab was among several people who had taken shelter at a school in the coastal city of Sidon after being evacuated from southern Lebanon following consecutive days of Israeli strikes. 
     
            She told the AFP news agency she had to leave after an Israeli strike next to her home left her building shaking.  
     
            “We got very stressed, this is why we had to leave and we came here. We were told it’s safe here. The situation is very tragic, the strikes were right next to us,” she said.
     
            Mohamed Hamayda, a Syrian man displaced from Deir al-Zahrani, told the news agency he had no choice but to take his mother and the rest of his family on public transport to the Kuwaiti school in Sidon after being told it had opened as a shelter. 
     
        “We have nowhere to go, we have nothing,” he said.  
     
 
            And Hassan Banjak said he had reluctantly fled the village of Chaaitiyeh. 
     
            “Since the war and bombings with the Israeli enemy began, we hadn’t left. But after the strikes intensified and got closer, the children got scared, so we decided to leave. If it wasn’t for the children I would have never left,” he said. 
     
Scale of destruction: Their accounts came as Reuters video footage from the southern suburbs of Beirut showed debris from damaged buildings and shards of glass littering the ground after Israel’s deadly wave of strikes on Monday.  
     
            One video showed a car with rubble on its windshield, in front of a building with shattered windows. Another video, from Zahle, which is east of Beirut in the Bekaa governorate, showed plumes of smoke rising in the distance.  
     
            An eyewitness video verified by CNN, which appears to have been taken from a balcony in the Bekaa governorate, shows smoke rising in what appears to be a multi-story residential compound. 
     
            The person filming can be heard saying, “This is right outside our house. This is right outside our house.” 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and Bekaa on Monday.  
     
            In the deadliest day of Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon since the 2006 war, nearly 500 people have been killed so far, including dozens of women and children, according to the Lebanese health ministry. 
     
            Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations General Assembly described the turmoil caused by Israel’s deadly attacks.
     
            Bahia El Hariri, a member of the Lebanese parliament, addressed the assembly in New York on Monday on behalf of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who she said was dealing with the “urgent circumstances facing the Lebanese people, including in their homes.” 
     
            El Hariri said Mikati was working with the government “to deal with the aggression that we are victim to at all levels, diplomatic, humanitarian, health, security, and also in terms of people’s livelihoods.” 
     
            She told the assembly that residential areas were being targeted and that there was an “exodus” of people trying to flee to safety. 
     
        “This has damaged the economy of our country and threatened our social order, especially since several countries have asked their nationals to leave our country,” she said. 
     
 
            Israel conducted its deadliest round of strikes in Lebanon against Hezbollah since the 2006 war on Monday, killing nearly 500 people including dozens of women and children. 
     
            “The summit of the future is taking place at a time that is ever so sensitive. The whole of humanity urgently needs dialogue to call ourselves into question and to become aware of the dangers that are threatening international peace and security,” she said. 
     
            The United States does not believe the reported Israeli strategy of “escalate to de-escalate” along its northern border with Hezbollah will be effective, a senior State Department official said, adding that the US and its partners are working to find a diplomatic off-ramp.  
     
        “I can’t recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation,” the official told reporters Monday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
     
 
            Instead, US officials and their global partners at the gathering in New York are working “to deal with the increasing challenges and risks of escalation across the blue line between Israel and Lebanon,” they said, noting this is a “key focus” for Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week.
     
            The official said the US and its partners had come up with some “concrete ideas” to de-escalate the situation, and they “want to stress test them to a degree with allies and partners whose support and participation are going to be essential to whether or not they may prove successful or not.”
     
            The official would not give details on the “concrete ideas,” but said they “reflect the ongoing set of conversations that we have had with the Israeli government, with other governments in the region, and with like-minded governments about, particularly the escalating tensions and escalating conflict in Lebanon.”
     
            The official did not say if the US expects Israel to launch a ground incursion on Lebanon if the efforts at de-escalation fail, but noted that it is “important for everyone to take Israeli preparations seriously.”
     
            Egypt’s national carrier, EgyptAir, says it is canceling all its flights to and from Beirut starting Tuesday “due to the current events unfolding in Lebanon.”
     
            The cancellations “will remain in effect until the situation stabilizes,” the airline said in a statement Monday.
     
            Earlier today, Jordan also announced a suspension of flights to Beirut until further notice.
     
            Hamas’ armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said Monday that one of its field commanders had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon.
     
            It named the commander as Hussein Mahmoud Al-Nader, also known as Abu Saleh, from the town of Marjeyoun in southern Lebanon.
     
            There’s “great satisfaction” among Israel’s political echelon with the military’s performance during Monday’s operation in Lebanon, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
Some background: On Monday, Israel launched the most intense wave of strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war. The military struck 1,300 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon and the operation is not over yet, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said earlier.
     
            Hagari did not rule out the possibility of a ground operation into Lebanon.
     
            At least 492 people in Lebanon have died and at least 1,645 were injured, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
Here’s what some high-profile figures in Israel have said so far:
 
            Lebanese authorities will suspend work in all courts and judicial departments across the country on Tuesday, according to the state-run news service NNA.
     
            The decision, announced by the Minister of Justice Henri Khoury and the head of the Supreme Judicial Council Judge Suhail Abboud, comes in response to the intensifying conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            Only urgent cases will be handled during the suspension, NNA said. It did not say if services would resume Wednesday.
     
            Officials in Jordan are expressing solidarity with Lebanon and calling for the United Nations to take action after Israel’s military launched airstrikes on what it says are Hezbollah targets that killed hundreds of people.
     
            Jordan’s King Abdullah warned Israel’s strikes in Lebanon represented a dangerous escalation and called for immediate international efforts to prevent a broader conflict in the region.
     
            He made the comments on a call with the Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, the Royal Hashemite Court said in a statement on Monday. Abdullah also said there was an urgent need to halt Israel’s conflict with Hamas in Gaza as a crucial step toward de-escalation. 
     
            Earlier Monday, Jordan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi called on the United Nations Security Council to act immediately to “curb Israeli aggression and protect the region from its disastrous consequences.” 
     
        “Israel continues to push the region towards the abyss of a comprehensive regional war because the international community has failed to protect its laws and values,” Safadi said in a post on X.  
     
 
            He noted the Israeli strikes came as world leaders meet in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and said Israel’s actions were in defiance of the 2006 Security Council Resolution 1701 which called for a permanent ceasefire and end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. 
     
            The Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority also announced that it was suspending Jordanian flights to Beirut until further notice, citing heightened regional tensions, according to a statement.
     
            The death toll from Israel’s strikes in Lebanon has risen to at least 492, according to the Lebanese health ministry.  
     
            Among the dead are 35 children and 58 women, the ministry said in a statement Monday regarding the ongoing strikes in southern Lebanon, Beqaa, and Baalbek.
     
            The ministry said that at least 1,645 people had been injured. 
     
            Some of the casualties following Israel’s strikes in Lebanon Monday were likely caused by secondary explosions, an Israeli military spokesperson said.
     
            At a press briefing on Monday, Daniel Hagari said there had been “many secondary explosions,” which occurred when buildings “containing deadly munitions, rockets and missiles” were struck. 
     
            “It is likely that some of the casualties are from these secondary explosions,” he said. 
     
        “Let me be clear: Hezbollah is responsible for this situation,” Hagari added.
     
 
            The spokesperson said Hezbollah was using civilian homes to store its weapons and showed photos that he said showed long-range rockets stored inside a house in Lebanon. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the photos. 
     
            “Among those killed were a large number of Hezbollah terrorists who were next to the weapons that we targeted, ” Hagari said, adding there had been a “high number of casualties.” 
     
Some background: Lebanon’s health ministry said at least 356 people have been killed including 24 children and 42 women during Israel’s aerial offensive against Hezbollah on Monday, the deadliest since the 2006 war. 
     
            Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid praised the operation in a post on X, saying, “Eliminations, a thousand targets within one day, hitting strategic assets. That’s how you restore the Israeli deterrence!”
     
            An Israeli military spokesperson did not rule out the possibility of a ground operation into Lebanon when asked about it at a press briefing on Monday. 
     
            Asked whether the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was prepared for a ground invasion and how quickly it could move in if an order came, Daniel Hagari said:
     
        “Is the army prepared? Yes, the army is in full readiness and we will do whatever is necessary to bring back home all our citizens to the northern border safely.” 
     
 
            Earlier Monday, Herzi Halevi, the IDF chief of the General Staff, said the military is “striking targets and preparing for the next phases, which I will elaborate on shortly.”
     
            Lebanon’s health care system is under strain as people flee their homes amid intense Israeli strikes, according to the Lebanon country director for MedGlobal, a non-governmental organization that provides medical relief to disaster areas.
     
            Dr. Tania Baban told CNN on Monday that some of those displaced likely have chronic conditions and may be on dialysis or chemotherapy, necessitating groups like MedGlobal to “move as quickly as possible to improve quality of life” and prevent deaths. 
     
            CNN has verified images that show traffic at a standstill on a main artery along the Lebanese coast, with a large number of cars traveling north in every lane. The evacuations are the result of mass displacement as tensions in the region reach a boiling point, Baban said.  
     
            Amid this mass displacement, she said many schools have been closed to be used as shelters for those seeking refuge. 
     
More context: In recent years, Lebanon’s health care system has struggled in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis and the Beirut port explosion in August 2020. These facilities have “already been slowly collapsing over the past few years, since 2019,” Baban said.
     
            The Israeli military has struck 1,300 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon in its intense aerial offensive so far, and the operation is not over yet, according to spokesperson Daniel Hagari.
     
            Among the targets were “cruise missiles” that had a reach of hundreds of kilometers, mid-range rockets with a reach of up to 200 kilometers (more than 124 miles), and rockets with explosive warheads, Hagari said in a press statement Monday.
     
        “These are all strategic munitions (which Hezbollah) stationed at the heart of the villages, within civilian homes, and from there they intended to launch them and harm the citizens of Israel,” he continued.
     
 
            Referring to the death toll from Monday’s strikes, which the Lebanese health ministry says have killed at least 356 people including 24 children and 42 women, Hagari said the casualties included “many terrorists” that “were nearby the weapons.”
     
            The “heavy rockets” were the same as the one “fired in the tragedy in Majdal Shams in which 12 children were murdered,” he said, making a reference to a strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in July. While Israel has blamed Hezbollah for that attack, the group has denied responsibility.
     
            The military spokesperson said there would be an update later on the number of militants killed.
     
            Israel’s top diplomat wrote to the United Nations Security Council president on Monday urging the council to condemn the recent Hezbollah attack on the Haifa region in northern Israel.
     
        “I call upon the Security Council to condemn in the strongest terms the recent attack launched by Hezbollah under the guidance of its Iranian patron, and their relentless attempts to destabilize the region,” Israel’s Foreign Minister wrote in a letter obtained by CNN to the Slovenian Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel Zbogar. Slovenia is currently serving as the council’s president. 
     
 
            Israel’s Iron Dome intercepted several rockets above the city of Haifa on Monday, as seen in videos geolocated by CNN to the city in northern Israel.
     
            The letter comes as world leaders are gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) after a weekend of bombings between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, contributing to the most intense exchanges of fire between the two sides since October 7. 
     
            The dominant focus of the New York gathering will be on the escalating regional tensions, though any clear plan to prevent the current crisis from turning into a regional conflict remains unclear.   
     
            Israel has repeatedly made similar calls, urging the UN to condemn its opponents even as it responds to attacks with military action of its own.
     
            It is unclear if the US will push the UN Security Council to condemn Hezbollah’s actions. The US State Department and the US Mission to the UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Katz’s letter. 
     
            Israel’s military launched the most intensive airstrikes on what it says are Hezbollah targets in Lebanon since 2006 on Monday, killing hundreds of people.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah and called for people to “get out of harm’s way.”
     
            The mounting tension in the region comes as world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this week in New York.
     
Here’s the latest on the conflict: 
 
Other key headlines today in the region:
 
            The death toll from Israel’s strikes in Lebanon has risen to 356, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            This includes 24 children and 42 women, the ministry said in a statement on Monday regarding the ongoing strikes in southern Lebanon, Bekaa and Ballbek.
     
            The ministry said that at least 1,246 people had been injured, adding that the situation remained fluid as authorities continued to assess the impact of the attacks.  
     
            It is the deadliest day of strikes from Israel in the country since the 2006 war.
     
The post has been updated to reflect the latest death toll.
 
            Israel’s defense minister said Monday the military had carried out an “impressive operation” against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
        “Today is a significant peak — on this day we have taken out of order tens of thousands of rockets and precise munitions. What Hezbollah has built over a period of 20 years since the second Lebanon War is in fact being destroyed by the IDF,” Yoav Gallant said. 
     
 
            Gallant’s comments followed what was Israel’s most intense wave of strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war. 
     
            The defense minister added that the past week had been the “most difficult” for Hezbollah since its inception, with a “blow” to the chain of command and control, and to morale. 
     
            Last week, Hezbollah was hit by a series of pager and walkie-talkie explosions while Israeli strikes in its stronghold in southern Beirut took out some of the group’s commanders, including a high-ranking elite force commander, Ibrahim Aqil. 
     
            On Monday, the Israeli military struck the southern suburbs of Beirut again. The military said it conducted a targeted strike, while Lebanese state news agency NNA said a building in the Bir al-Abed area in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs, was targeted with three missiles, leaving a number of people injured. 
     
            Israel’s Iron Dome intercepted several rockets above the city of Haifa on Monday, as seen in videos geolocated by CNN to the city in northern Israel.
     
            In the latest instance, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said five projectiles had been fired at Haifa from Lebanon, with sirens sounding at 7:42 p.m. local time. It said it had “intercepted a number” of those projectiles. 
     
            In total, the IDF said about 210 rockets had been fired from Lebanon toward Israel Monday.  
     
            Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The group’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war has been palpable — Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in skirmishes since the war began, putting the entire region on a knife’s edge with fears it could spark a wider regional conflict. 
     
            Here’s what to know about the decades-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel:
     
Israeli invasion: Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory when it invaded Lebanon in 1982. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reports and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Beirut refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila. It’s one of the bloodiest events in the region’s recent history. The investigation, known as the Kahan Commission of Inquiry, held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000.
     
The rise of Hezbollah: As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon’s fractious political landscape. The ragtag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, plus some civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
A “supportive front” for Gaza in 2023: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has engaged in increased clashes with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started on October 7, 2023. The alliance said it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding itself as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader.
     
Killing of key leader: After months of tit-for-tat exchanges, tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, with a strike on Beirut in July. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles at targets in Israel in August. Israel denied any important targets were struck, and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. Officials and residents from the northern region have placed increasing pressure on the Israeli government about the need to return. More than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
Latest attack: Israel struck a residential building in Beirut last week, killing Hezbollah senior commander Ibrahim Aqil. Lebanon was already reeling after thousands of small blasts hit Hezbollah members’ pagers and walkie-talkies during the week, killing dozens and wounding thousands. In the latest, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon on Monday killed at least 274, with 1,024 people wounded, the Lebanese Health Minister said in a news conference. It is the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war. In a televised speech, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the people of Lebanon to “get out of harm’s way,” saying his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah.
     
            Israel is “preparing for the next phases,” the head of the military said Monday evening following the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war.
     
            Herzi Halevi, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of the General Staff, said the military is “striking targets and preparing for the next phases, which I will elaborate on shortly.” 
     
            “Ultimately, everything is focused on creating the conditions to return the residents of the north to their homes,” he added in remarks distributed by the IDF.
     
            Halevi said that the IDF this morning began a “proactive offensive operation” to target infrastructure “that Hezbollah has been building for the past 20 years.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah.  
     
        “I have a message for the people of Lebanon: Israel’s war is not with you,” Netanyahu said during a televised speech on Monday. “It’s with Hezbollah.” 
     
 
            The Israeli prime minister called on the Lebanese people to “get out of harm’s way” while it targets Hezbollah positions.  
     
            “For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens,” Netanyahu said.
     
            He said Israel has to take out those weapons “to defend our people against Hezbollah strikes.”
     
            “I urge you – take this warning seriously,” the Israeli prime minister said, “Please, get out of harm’s way now. Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.”
     
            US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the latest developments in Israel and Lebanon and said that his administration remains in contact with their counterparts in Israel amid escalating strikes between Israel and Hezbollah and fears of a wider regional conflict breaking out.  
     
        “We also will discuss our efforts to end the war in Gaza and a number of regional issues. I’ve been briefed on the latest developments in Israel and in Lebanon. My team is in constant contact with their counterparts, and we’re working to deescalate in a way that allows people to return to their home safely,” Biden said at the top of a bilateral meeting with the president of the United Arab Emirates in the Oval Office.
     
 
            Biden added that he remains “committed” to the UAE’s security and announced that the UAE is now a “major defense partner of the United States.”
     
            The Israeli cabinet on Monday evening declared a “special situation” across the country, giving it the power to impose restrictions on civilian life, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            Currently, only communities north of Haifa and in the direct vicinity of Gaza face such restrictions, like the closure of schools and limits on public gatherings. 
     
            Those restrictions remain limited to those areas, but in a sign of the escalating conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, which possesses much longer-range rockets than Hamas, the cabinet has given itself the power to — in the future — impose drastic restrictions across the country.
     
            Medical relief NGO MedGlobal is prepared to deliver food, winterization kits, hygiene kits and dignity kits for women and young girls to 400 Lebanese families displaced by the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon lead Dr. Tania Baban told CNN on Monday.
     
        “We already have more than 100,000 people that have been displaced and obviously as of today this is increasing by the minute. So we’ve designated for 400 families and the mapping is happening right now in which schools we can find these families,” she said.
     
 
            Dr Hassan, who is based in Lebanon said the violence that the country had seen in the past week, including with pager explosions walkie-talkie explosions and then strikes “should not be normalized.”
     
        “We’re not used to seeing these images in Lebanon. Unfortunately, after what’s been happening in Gaza it’s become kind of the norm,” she said.
     
 
            “I hate to say this but these types of scenes should not be normalized, human death should not be normalized, civilian and human death should not be normalized but we’re seeing this on a daily basis and it’s just heartbreaking,” Dr. Baban added.
     
            A resident of the southern city of Tyre on the coast of Lebanon has described how Israeli warplanes had been “raining” bombs near his home since 5 a.m. local time on Monday.  
     
            Haidar Al-Rouz said he saw several residential buildings collapse and that “the city is being emptied of its residents. 
     
        “Everyone is fleeing,” he said. 
     
 
            Israeli warplanes were seen flying over different parts of the country late afternoon, including over Mount Lebanon where Hezbollah does not have a notable presence. 
     
            At the Be’r Hassan institute in Beirut, vans and cars brought families from the south, carrying their belongings in small handbags and plastic bags. 
     
            In one instance five extended families arrived — close to 40 people — according to one volunteer, Qassim, who said they were still preparing the educational complex building for an influx of people. 
     
            “We expect this building to be full by the end of the day,” he said. 
     
            Janna Ayash, 70, from the village of Kafra in the southern Nabaityeh governorate, pointed to the cigarette in her hand and said, “it’s been just smoking and no food for the past four days.” 
     
            Ayash described heavy traffic on the roads, some destroyed by bombing, after leaving her home at 5 a.m. local following intensified strikes. 
     
        “I buried my son a week ago under bombardment and my other son is still left behind. He doesn’t want to leave our home,” she added.  
     
 
            She says she got her son’s wife and children out and they are staying in an empty classroom at the institute in Beirut. 
     
            As world leaders converge in New York for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) this week, some United States officials are concerned that the global gathering could further enflame mounting tensions in the Middle East.
     
            According to two US officials, the concern is concentrated on what some countries might say about the conflict while the entire world is watching, even as the US officials have been urging de-escalation for months and have reiterated that call in recent days.
     
            Typically, US officials view UNGA as an opportunity to galvanize the world behind a major US push, such as supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression in recent years. But this concern makes the anxiety US officials are feeling this year unique.
     
            American officials are particularly bracing for the possibility of new countries recognizing Palestine as a state, explained officials. Even if new countries are not added to the effort to recognize it, they are watching for what the countries say that have already made the move earlier this year, such as US allies Norway, Spain and Ireland. 
     
            The US will also have eyes on the speech by the leader of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, and a possible speech by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu if he attends the gathering, which is a question that remains in the air.
     
            The world leaders are gathering after a weekend of bombings from both Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, contributing to the most intense exchanges of fire between the two sides since October 7. US officials are not tracking definite Israeli plans for a ground invasion into Lebanon after the weekend of escalations, but they remain concerned about the possibility.
     
            The United Nations rights office said it was “extremely concerned” about the escalating violence between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and warned of the risk of a “regional spillover” of hostilities. 
     
        “We are extremely concerned, deeply worried about the escalation in Lebanon, the attacks that we saw on the communication devices, the pagers, followed by rocket attacks and rocket fire being exchanged on both sides. It marks a real escalation in the conflict,” Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, told Agence France-Presse Monday.
     
 
            Shamdasani said that “both the actions and rhetoric” of both Israel and Hezbollah are “taking the conflict to another level.” The spokesperson added that the UN has been warning about this situation.
     
            “Over decades, we have seen civilians caught in the middle of these conflicts, this rhetoric, this escalation. But instead of a de-escalation, what we have seen over the weekend, as well, is further rhetoric with further plans of an escalation, and this needs to stop,” she said.
     
            The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a peacekeeping mission, has also expressed “grave concern” for the safety of civilians in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL head Gen. Aroldo Lázaro said Monday he had engaged with Lebanese and Israeli parties, stressing the urgent need for de-escalation.

            The US military is sending “a small number of US military personnel forward” to the Middle East to “augment the forces already in the region,” amid heightened tensions between Israel and Lebanon, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said on Monday. 
     
        “In light of the increased tensions in the Middle East, and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,” Ryder said. “But for operational security reasons I’m not going to comment further.” 
     
 
            Ryder declined to say how many troops were deployed, where they were sent, and what branch they belonged to. 
     
            The US already has thousands of troops in the region and has positioned assets in the eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea amid the heightened tensions, including destroyers, the Lincoln carrier strike group, and fighter aircraft, Ryder said.
     
            A Lebanese telecoms company said it detected 80,000 automated calls on Monday from numbers that masked their true location, urging people to evacuate their homes.  
     
            Ogero’s CEO Imad Kreidieh told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the calls were received across the country. 
     
        “They have been randomly scattered over Lebanon, most of them were in the southern part of the country nevertheless, many calls received as well in the north and the Beqaa Valley, as well as in Beirut itself,” Kreideh said. 
     
 
            Earlier on Monday, Lebanese citizens in Beirut and other regions said they received text messages calling on them to evacuate immediately, according to the national news agency, NNA.  
     
            The Lebanese government said it had ordered the suspension of all classes in schools and universities across the country as Israel intensified its air campaign against what it says are Hezbollah targets. 
     
            The government had initially suspended classes in private and public educational institutions in a few regions, but as the death toll rose throughout the day, the ministry said schools would be shuttered in the rest of the country, including the capital, Beirut. 
     
            The suspension was ordered to continue until at least Tuesday as a precautionary measure to protect students. 
     
            Iran warned Israel of “dangerous consequences” following the strikes on what Israel said were Hezbollah targets that killed more than 270 people in Lebanon on Monday.
     
            Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani “strongly condemned” the Israeli airstrikes, describing them as “crazy,” according to a post on Telegram. He also warned of “the dangerous consequences of the Zionists’ new adventure.” 
     
            Kanaani “strongly” criticized the United States’ support of Israel, and what he called its “crimes” in Palestinian territories. He cited “the expansion of the scope of these crimes to Lebanon as a clear example of a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.” 
     
            Kanaani called on the United Nations Security Council “to take immediate action to stop these crimes.” 
     
            The death toll from Monday’s Israeli strikes on Lebanon has risen to 274, with 1,024 people wounded, the Lebanese health minister said in a news conference.  
     
        “These are unprecedented numbers,” said Dr. Firass Abiad, adding that 21 children and 39 women were among the dead. 
     
 
            He said convoys of vehicles evacuating people from the areas under fire had been “targeted,” as had two ambulances, a fire truck and a medical center. Two first responders were killed, he added. 
     
            Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said earlier on Monday that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was trying to “mitigate the harm to Lebanese civilians as much as possible.” 
     
            Abiad said nearly 5,000 people have been wounded in the hostilities over the past six days, when Lebanon saw a new wave of deadly attacks including exploding pagers and walkie-talkies. 
     
            As a result of Monday’s attacks, thousands of families have been displaced from the targeted areas. 
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is changing the “balance of power” on its northern front, as Israel’s military launched the most intensive airstrikes on what it says are Hezbollah targets in Lebanon since 2006.
     
        “I promised to change the security balance, the balance of power in the north - this is exactly what we’re doing,” Netanyahu said at a meeting in the headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday. “We’re dismantling thousands of rockets and missiles aimed at Israeli cities and citizens,” he added.
     
 
            Netanyahu said Israelis faced “complex days” ahead and asked them to follow the Home Front Command guidelines. 
     
        “To those who didn’t understand, I would like to clarify Israel’s policy: we’re not waiting for a threat, we are ahead of it. Everywhere, in every arena, anytime. We’re eliminating seniors, eliminating commanders, eliminating rockets – and counting. Those who will try to hurt us, we will hurt him gravely,” he said.
     
 
            Wars of peace are rarely successful. They are normally of choice: pre-emptively attacking to neutralize a perceived threat. Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck in the tit-for-tat horror of escalation chicken for nearly a year. But over the past week Israel has clearly decided to massively amplify its attacks on the Iran-backed militant group, claiming, according to some reports, they seek to “escalate to deescalate” – to cow their adversary into a diplomatic solution.
     
            It is a highly risky and likely flawed mantra, perhaps designed to dupe their frustrated ally, the United States, into believing that the diplomatic solution, which Washington has now sunk an almost embarrassing amount of energy into, is still also Israel’s goal.
     
            But the greater the harm inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the more likely a shorter-term Israeli success has seemed. A full-scale ground war between a tired, divided Israeli military and an experienced, angry Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon would likely be disastrous for Israel. It is exactly what the militant group is good at and waiting for. Yet it is also something Israel does not for now need to get into.

            The death toll from Israel’s intensive air campaign in southern and eastern Lebanon where the Iran-backed Hezbollah has a strong presence marks the deadliest escalation since the 2006 conflict. 
     
            The Israel-Lebanon war of that year, which included an air, naval and ground campaign by Israeli forces, devastated large parts of the country. At the time, more than 1,100 Lebanese people were killed in Israeli strikes, including around 250 Hezbollah militants, while 121 soldiers and 43 civilians were killed on the Israeli side by Hezbollah rocket attacks.
     
            A truce largely held between Lebanon and Israel in the years between the 2006 war and the start of the Hezbollah-Israel border conflict last October 8. 
     
            The current conflict, which has mostly spanned a roughly 4 kilometers (2.49 miles) on both sides of the border, has escalated significantly after Israel’s war cabinet formally prioritized repatriating Israel’s displaced residents from its northernmost territory last Tuesday. Since then, the intensified attacks on Hezbollah targets, many of which were in densely populated civilian areas, has triggered a dramatic rise in the death toll, with both militants and civilians among the victims. 
     
            At least 182 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday and 727 people were wounded. Women, children and medics are among those killed and wounded, Lebanon’s health ministry said Monday.  
     
            It is unclear how many of the casualties were civilians or Hezbollah militants. But many of the locations described by Israel as Hezbollah targets are residential neighborhoods and villages. 
     
            As Israeli airstrikes continue to pound southern and eastern Lebanon, sending thick plumes of smoke into the air, and triggering mass displacement of civilians, there are unmistakable echoes of the 2006 war. Increasingly, people are describing the conflict as a war in all but name. And there are growing fears that the country is on the threshold of violence more catastrophic than that year’s war. 
     
            The rapidly escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon is further threatening President Joe Biden’s efforts to reduce tension in the Middle East, leaving the president with ever-diminishing options to secure a ceasefire-and-hostage deal that has become his top priority in the final months of his presidency.
     
            As he prepares for his final high-profile speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, the crisis is overshadowing any attempt at burnishing his foreign policy legacy. Without any near-term hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza, Biden is facing new questions about his approach to the nearly year-long conflict.
 
            White House officials watched with concern over the weekend as Israeli warplanes struck targets in Lebanon while Hezbollah fired rockets and drones into northern Israel. As Biden was meeting Asia-Pacific leaders in Delaware, the crisis was unfolding in a different part of the world. The president and his aides were closely monitoring the situation from Wilmington.
     
            Biden’s aides currently view the risk of escalation as serious and real, and have been communicating on a daily basis with officials in Israel, officials said Monday.

            Israel will soon strike Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, Israeli military chief spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced Monday, asking residents of villages “inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored” to evacuate immediately.  
     
            Israeli strikes in the Beqaa Valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence, are more infrequent than those in southern Lebanon because of the relative distance of the eastern Lebanese region from Israel’s border. 
     
            The Israeli military is currently using “aerial and intelligence means to locate” weapons being stored by Hezbollah in the Beqaa Valley, Hagari said in a video message.  
     
        “We are preparing to strike terrorist targets in the Beqaa Valley region soon… I urge the Lebanese residents of the villages in the Beqaa Valley who are inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored, to move away immediately,” he warned.  
     
 
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also issued a warning to residents in Arabic: “If you are inside or near a house containing Hezbollah weapons, you must leave it and move away from it within two hours, at a distance of no less than 1,000 meters outside the village or go to the central school near you and do not return to it until further notice.” 
     
            Attached to the warning was a map asking residents of the Beqaa Valley towns of Hermel, Aarsal, Baalbek, Yammouneh, Nabi Chit and Kfar Zabad to all evacuate. 
     
            Hagari said that the IDF had hit more than 300 Hezbollah targets on Monday as part of what he described as “extensive, proactive airstrikes.”  
     
            Hagari showed a video of what he said was an Israeli strike carried out earlier on Monday on the Lebanese village of Jabal al-Batam. He said the IDF has been targeting storehouses holding Hezbollah munitions.  
     
            “The sights you are seeing now in south Lebanon, these are explosions of Hezbollah munition that explode inside houses,” he claimed, accusing Hezbollah of storing weapons in civilian buildings.
     
            As of 3:44 p.m. local time (8:44 a.m. ET), the death toll from Israeli strikes in Lebanon has risen to 182 with more than 700 people wounded, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said Monday. 
     
            Early on Monday, Israel carried out the most intensive air campaign against what it says are Hezbollah targets in Lebanon since the conflict in Gaza started in October.
     
            It is unclear how many of the casualties are civilians or Hezbollah militants, but many of the Israeli strikes targeted residential areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, and local media has reported women and children among the victims. 
     
            Women, children and medics are among those killed and wounded in Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, Lebanon’s health ministry said Monday.   
     
            So far, at least 100 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon on Monday, the ministry said. 
     
            It’s unclear how many of the casualties are civilians or Hezbollah militants, but many of the Israeli strikes targeted residential areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence.
     
            A popular Lebanese radio station said it was hacked and its broadcast was interrupted by an Israeli evacuation warning on Monday. 
     
            In a video, widely shared on social media but not verified by CNN, a voice can be heard breaking into a program on the Voice of Lebanon radio station to deliver what it said was “an urgent warning to the residents of south Lebanon.” 
     
        “Hezbollah is forcing the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to target military areas in the village. The [IDF] don’t want to harm you. If you are located in a building used by…” the message continues before cutting off.
     
 
            Voice of Lebanon, a privately owned radio station, said its services had been hacked by Israel, in a message posted on its website Monday.
     
            The apparent radio hack comes as Lebanese citizens in Beirut and other regions said they received similar text messages, calling on them to evacuate immediately, according to the national news agency, NNA.
     
            On Monday, the Israeli military’s chief spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, asked “residents of Lebanese villages to pay attention to the messages and warnings published by the IDF and heed them.”

            Lebanon’s government has ordered the suspension of classes in public and private schools in different parts of the country as fears mount of an escalating war with Israel.
     
            The government order will keep schools closed for two days in the southern region of Lebanon and aims to protect students from the escalating dangers of the security situation, a statement by the Lebanese education ministry said.
     
            The order took effect on Monday in the governorates of South Lebanon, Nabatieh, Bekaa, Baalbek-Hermel and the southern suburbs, the education ministry said.  
     
            Video shared with CNN journalists in Lebanon shows large queues of traffic as people flee towns across the country for the capital, Beirut. 
     
            One person fleeing Sidon, a coastal city south of Beirut, told CNN they had never seen as much traffic leaving the town, and that the army was telling civilians to empty the streets.
     
            Data from Google Maps showed significant delays along main roads from the south to the north at 1 p.m. local time. 
     
            At least 50 people have been killed and more than 300 wounded by Israeli air strikes in Lebanon, the ministry of health said Monday.
     
            It said the death toll is only a preliminary count.
     
            Early on Monday, Israel carried out the most intensive air campaign in Lebanon since the conflict in Gaza started last October. 
     
            Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. 
     
            Backed by Iran and based in the eastern Mediterranean country of Lebanon, the Shia Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8.
     
            The cross-border hostilities have raised the specter of a regional conflagration and prompted intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel and its allies in the region.
     
            On Sunday, the group said it used new missiles it calls Fadi-1 and Fadi-2, believed to be medium-range rockets. If confirmed, this would mark one of the first times Hezbollah has fired weapons outside of its short-range arsenal.

            Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has urged the United Nations to pressure Israel into stopping the “aggression” on his country.  
     
            Mikati told his cabinet that Israel is planning to “destroy Lebanese villages and towns” and asked for an intervention from the UN Security Council and “influential countries,” a statement on X said. 
     
            The caretaker prime minister also accused Israel of having a “destructive plan” and conducting a “war of extermination” against Lebanon. 
     
            On Sunday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said he is concerned Lebanon could be transformed into “another Gaza” amid escalating attacks between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            The UN chief told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview that the recent detonation of communication devices in Lebanon means there is a “potential for a much stronger escalation,” which he fears could be a “devastating tragedy for the world.”
     
            President Joe Biden also told reporters yesterday he remains concerned about the ongoing tensions in the Middle East amid fears that escalating attacks between Hezbollah and Israel may lead to a wider regional conflict.
     
            “We’re going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we’re still pushing hard,” Biden told reporters Sunday on the South Lawn.
     
            Civilians are fleeing areas of southern Lebanon beyond the immediate border area, which had already been emptied by the nearly year-long exchange of fire over the frontier.  
     
            Some residents are also leaving the Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood of Dahiyeh, the southern suburb of Beirut, and CNN has seen at least one car crammed with suitcases leaving that area in recent days.  
     
            In Beirut, people appear to have stayed in their homes, with the streets largely empty during the day, as news poured in of attacks in Hezbollah-dominated areas across the country, including residential neighborhoods and villages. 
     
            Video captured by Reuters from Tyre in southern Lebanon shows smoke rising over a village near the Israeli border on Monday morning. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said it was conducting further airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Monday morning.  
     
            Lebanese citizens in Beirut and other regions have received phone messages from Israel calling on them to evacuate immediately, the country’s national news agency.
     
            Lebanese citizens in Beirut and other regions have received phone messages from Israel calling on them to evacuate immediately, the country’s national news agency reported Monday as fears grow of a wider regional war.  
     
            The country’s Minister of Information told NNA that his office also received one of these messages, calling it “psychological warfare.”  
     
            Israel’s military on Monday urged civilians in Lebanon to leave areas in which Hezbollah operates, warning it would soon “engage in extensive precise strikes” against the group.  
     
            “We ask residents of Lebanese villages to pay attention to the messages and warning published by the IDF and heed them,” Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters. 
     
            Hagari also said messages will soon be sent to people in Lebanon, with the same warnings. 
     
            This is the first time Israel has issued such messages in this way,  a military official told CNN. “We are doing an advanced warning with accurate means saying, ‘if you’re in a house where there is a missile or a cruise missile, get out immediately,’” the official added.  
     
            CNN has seen multiple screen shots from unknown senders warning them to leave the vicinity of buildings “storing Hezbollah weapons.” 
     
            Israel is conducting further airstrikes in southern Lebanon, the Israeli military said in a statement Monday. 
     
            The update comes after Israel said it struck 150 Hezbollah targets and urged civilians to leave areas where the Iran-backed militant group operates ahead of further strikes.
     
            One person was killed and six injured in the Israeli strikes earlier Monday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. 
     
            Israel’s military struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon early Monday as it urged civilians to leave areas where the Iran-backed militant group operates ahead of further planned strikes.
     
            The strikes Monday, which appear to be the widest in geographic range simultaneously conducted by Israel in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, came after the two sides exchanged their most intense fire of the conflict over the weekend.
     
            As fears of a wider regional war grow, Hezbollah’s second-in-command said “a battle without limits” was underway and the group launched some of its deepest strikes inside Israel in decades.
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            Israel’s defense minister briefed his US counterpart on Israeli military operations against Hezbollah on Sunday after Israel and the Iran-backed militant group exchanged their most intense fire since the war in Gaza began.
     
            In a post on X on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said he gave US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “a situation assessment of Hezbollah threats and briefed him on IDF operations to degrade Hezbollah’s ability to launch attacks against Israeli civilians.”
     
            The two officials also discussed “the wider regional situation and the threats posed by Iran and its proxies,” Gallant said.
     
            Earlier Sunday, the Pentagon said the two officials had also spoken following a barrage of rocket attacks by Hezbollah into Israel on Saturday.
     
        “During the call, the Secretary reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Israel’s right to defend itself and stressed the importance of achieving a diplomatic solution to return citizens to their homes in the north,” a Pentagon readout said. 
     
 
            Israel’s military carried out “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon Monday as it urged civilians to leave areas where the Iran-backed militant group operates ahead of further planned attacks.
     
Some context: Ahead of twin attacks targeting Hezbollah members’ wireless devices last week, Israeli officials told the US the country was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon, but did not give any details about what they were planning, according to three sources familiar with the matter. 
     
            The US “did not know about nor was it involved in these incidents,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.
     
            Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah ramped up significantly last week after twin device attacks targeted the Iran-backed militant group’s communications network, ushering in what Israel’s defense minister called a “new era” of war.
     
            Last Tuesday, pagers belonging to Hezbollah members exploded almost simultaneously, exposing a massive security breach and demonstrating the scale of Israeli intelligence. A day later, hundreds of Hezbollah walkie-talkies detonated in a single minute.
     
            At least 80 people have been killed in attacks since Tuesday. Most were Hezbollah operatives, but the casualties also include women and children.
     
            Now, one of the world’s largest non-state fighting forces is reeling from the biggest-ever hit to its military structure, as well as the most visible Israeli infiltration of its ranks and communications infrastructure in its more than 40-year history. 
     
            The internal breach enabled the successive blows last week and sowed panic within Hezbollah, according to Lebanese security sources. Hezbollah has vowed to respond in “a battle without limits.”

            A shepherd was killed and two of his family members injured in Israeli strikes in Lebanon early on Monday, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported.  
     
            Israeli strikes targeted towns in the Bekaa valley, including areas near Wadi Fara, Bneit, Harbata, Wadi Shmastar, and Wadi Umm Ali, according to NNA. Strikes were also reported in southern Lebanon, according to the news agency.  
     
            Lebanon’s health ministry said one person was killed and six injured in Israeli strikes on the Bekaa valley.
     
            The Israeli military on Monday said it had conducted “extensive airstrikes” on Hezbollah in Lebanon, adding that it struck 150 targets. The military also urged civilians to leave areas where the Iran-backed group operates in the country, warning that more strikes will happen soon.  
     
            The strikes Monday appear to be widest in geographic range simultaneously carried out by Israel in Lebanon since the outbreak of fighting with Hezbollah on October 8 last year following Palestinian militant group Hamas’ attack on Israel. 
     
            Reports from NNA also indicated a strike in the Laqlouq mountains in Jbeil governorate, an area that is not considered a Hezbollah stronghold.

            Hillary Clinton has criticized Columbia University’s pro-Palestinian campus protests, which she alleged were heavily influenced by outside funding and groups, calling the demonstrators’ treatment of Jewish students “nasty.”
     
            In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on “GPS” Sunday, the former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate described how she watched tensions at Columbia – where she co-teaches a course – escalate in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attacks and Israel’s retaliation in Gaza.
     
            “There were already existing groups within our country and particularly on certain campuses like Columbia who had talking points,” Clinton said.
     
            “They had a plan for protest and disruption, and I watched it morph into something that was not student-led, even though students participated, but which had outside funding, outside direction.”
     
            Clinton blamed biased social media algorithms and external influences — though she did not specify which ones — for enflaming the campus protests.
     
            Clinton said videos on social media represented a “one-sided,” “pro-Hamas” view of the war, and that many of the protesters she met did not understand the history of the complex, longstanding conflict.
     
        “I’m willing to sit down and have a conversation with anybody, but it’s difficult to have conversations with people who hold strong opinions with no factual and historical basis.” Clinton said.
     
 
            “In trying to talk to students, not just at Columbia but elsewhere, I would be met with slogans. I would be met with attacks and very inflammatory language,” she added.
     
Some context: Columbia became the epicenter of pro-Palestinian student protests during the last school year, with demonstrations roiling universities across the country. Most of the protests were peaceful, but some erupted into violence and disrupted academic life on campus.
     
            The majority of demonstrators were calling for divestment from companies that support Israel and the war in Gaza and calling attention to the worsening humanitarian crisis in the enclave. Some Jewish and Muslim students said they were intimidated, harassed or physically assaulted by different sides.
     
            Israel’s military on Monday urged civilians in Lebanon to leave areas in which Hezbollah operates, warning it would soon “engage in extensive precise strikes” against the Iran-backed militant group across the country. 
     
            The warning from the Israel Defense Forces comes as it conducted “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets early Monday, following a weekend that saw the two sides exchange their most intense fire since the war in Gaza began last October. 
     
        “We ask residents of Lebanese villages to pay attention to the messages and warning published by the IDF and heed them,” IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a news conference.“We advise civilians from Lebanese villages located in and next to buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purpose, such as those used to store weapons, to immediately move out of harm’s way for their own safety,” he said.  
     
 
            Hezbollah, the most powerful non-state militia in the region, is a clandestine group and people in Lebanon do not typically know the identities of its members or its operations.  
     
            Hagari also said Monday that messages will soon be sent to people in Lebanon, with the same warnings.  
     
            Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Backed by Iran and based in the eastern Mediterranean country of Lebanon, the Shia Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8.
     
            The cross-border hostilities have raised the specter of a regional conflagration and prompted intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel and its allies in the region.
     
            Put simply: Hezbollah are capable of striking all of Israel. While Israel has a vastly superior military to Hezbollah, the group boasts missiles with a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles). These would have to bypass Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system to cause damage.
     
            Israel would also have to contend with Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The group is part of an Iran-led axis of militants spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq. Some of these groups have increased coordination significantly since last October, when Israel launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked the country. This axis is known in Israel as the “ring of fire.”

            Israel is “conducting extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the Israeli military said early on Monday. 
     
            Lebanon’s national news agency reported multiple Israeli strikes across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa valley.
     
            Video from southern Lebanon obtained by CNN showed an object falling from the sky in a rural area before exploding in a burst of flames, which then turned to smoke, accompanied by a loud boom.
     
            The Hezbollah militant group has fired more than 8,000 rockets toward Israel since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said Sunday.
     
            Danon’s comments come as Israel and Hezbollah have been trading their most intense fire since the attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.
     
        “As we are gathered here to speak about the future, hundreds of rockets are being fired at our civilian population in Israel,” Danon told the UN General Assembly from New York.
     
 
            “However, we will not stand by as our people are attacked,” Danon said, adding that Israel will use “all means at hand” to protect its citizens.
     
            He said about 70,000 people have been “forced to flee their homes” in northern Israel and are “becoming refugees in their own land.”
     
        “We did not start this war, but we will protect our homes, our land and our people,” he said.
     
 
            Israel and Hezbollah have traded the most intense exchanges of fire since the October 7 attacks in recent weeks. 
     
Here are the latest developments in the region:
 
            The Middle East’s most formidable non-state fighting force is reeling from the biggest-ever hit to its military structure, as well as the most visible Israeli infiltration of its ranks and communications infrastructure in its more than 40-year history. 
     
            The internal breach enabled the successive blows this week and sowed panic within Hezbollah, according to Lebanese security sources.
     
            In a Saturday news conference, Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi gave an impassioned speech, declaring that the country was in the throes of an Israeli “breach” and vowing to ramp up the monitoring of “foreigners, hotels and Syrian camps.”
     
            The enemy’s firepower had pursued Hezbollah to its lair, attacking rank-and-file and military leadership alike.
     
            Weakened militarily and stripped of its cloak of secrecy, Hezbollah has arrived at the most delicate phase of its decades-long fight against Israel. It hoped that a low-level fight on the border on behalf of the Palestinians would prop up Hamas’ position in the negotiations, but a ceasefire in Gaza seems more elusive than ever before. 
     
            Now its limited confrontation with Israel has exacted a seemingly unlimited price from the militant group. Yet the compulsion to lash out has rarely been greater, bringing the region even closer to the brink of a catastrophic war.
     
Read the full analysis.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a plan to force all Palestinian civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in order to lay siege to Hamas and force the release of hostages.
     
            It is unclear how many Palestinians remain north of the so-called Netzarim Corridor, which splits Gaza in two, but estimates run into the hundreds of thousands. The plan does not mention whether, when, or how civilians would be allowed to return to northern Gaza. After nearly a year of war, with no part of Gaza immune from Israeli airstrikes, Palestinians have been increasingly unwilling to heed Israeli demands to relocate.
     
            The idea comes from a group of retired Israeli military generals, who have formally presented it to the Israeli cabinet and a powerful parliamentary committee. The goal, they say, is to use siege tactics to starve Hamas fighters and force them to release 101 hostages still held in the territory.
     
        “Those who leave will receive food and water,” Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli military general who is spearheading the proposal, says in a slickly produced video posted online earlier this month.“But in a week the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory, and this military territory as far as we are concerned, no supplies will enter it.”
     
 
            Israeli national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate, reported on Sunday that Netanyahu, in a closed-door meeting with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said that the plan “makes a lot of sense.”

            Lebanon’s education ministry has ordered school closures in areas affected by the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            “School directors of educational institutions in areas experiencing tensions, acts of war, or conditions that prevent parents from sending their children to school are required to close their schools and inform their students and the educational regions,” the Ministry of Education and Higher Education said Sunday.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have in the past few days been trading their most intense fire since the October 7 attacks.
     
            The militant group fired scores of rockets and missiles overnight into Israel, striking deeper than it has done in recent attacks. 
     
            The militant group’s second-in-command said “a battle without limits” is now underway.
     
            The Hezbollah militant group has fired more than 8,000 rockets toward Israel since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said Sunday.
     
            Danon’s comments come as Israel and Hezbollah have been trading their most intense fire since the attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.
     
        “As we are gathered here to speak about the future, hundreds of rockets are being fired at our civilian population in Israel,” Danon told the UN General Assembly from New York.
     
 
            “However, we will not stand by as our people are attacked,” Danon said, adding that Israel will use “all means at hand” to protect its citizens.
     
            He said about 70,000 people have been “forced to flee their homes” in northern Israel and are “becoming refugees in their own land.”
     
        “We did not start this war, but we will protect our homes, our land and our people,” he said.
     
 
            The most intense exchanges of fire since the October 7 attacks have been traded between Israel and Hezbollah in recent weeks. 
     
            The Iranian-backed militant group fired scores of rockets and missiles overnight into Israel, striking deeper than they have done in recent attacks, as the group’s second-in-command declared that “a battle without limits” is now underway.
     
            Hezbollah said the launches were in retaliation for an Israeli strike on southern Beirut that targeted several Hezbollah commanders, killing at least 45 people.
     
            Here’s what to know about what else is happening in the region: 
     
            President Joe Biden told reporters Sunday he remains concerned about the ongoing tensions in the Middle East amid fears that escalating attacks between Hezbollah and Israel may lead to a wider regional conflict.
     
        “But we’re going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we’re still pushing hard,” Biden told reporters on the South Lawn.
     
 
            Biden, who was returning after a weekend in Wilmington, Delaware, where he had hosted the leaders of the Quad, which includes Australia, India and Japan, added that he believed it had been a “successful” weekend of diplomacy.
     
            “We had very successful meetings of the Quad in Delaware. Total unity, we’re all working together, we feel good about what we’re doing,” Biden said.
     
            The Lebanese University announced on Sunday that its campuses in three cities will be closed on Monday, citing security concerns.
     
            The university said in a statement the decision to suspend activities was “due to the instability caused by the continuation of Israeli attacks, and to protect the safety of students, teachers and employees.”
     
            Educational activities will be suspended in the cities of Sidon, Nabatieh, and Tyre in southern Lebanon. The university said it will update students “according to the development of the situation.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been trading their most intense fire since the October 7 attacks. The region was already on edge after wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members exploded and Israel killed a top commander in a strike on southern Beirut.
     
            The Israeli military is “prepared for the next steps” in its fight against Hezbollah and is planning to take them in “the next few days,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said Sunday.
     
        “We are well prepared for the next steps, and are planning them in a high-quality way for the next few days,” he said.
     
 
            Halevi warned Hezbollah that it would be dealt another blow until it accepts that Israeli citizens who fled the region to escape violence will return to their homes in the north. 
     
            He also said that Israel’s attack on Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force is a message to anyone in the Middle East who threatens Israeli citizens.
     
            On Friday, an Israeli airstrike hit a nine-story apartment building in a southern Beirut suburb, killing at least 45 people, among them 16 Hezbollah militants, including the Radwan Force leader Ibrahim Aqil and senior commander Ahmad Wehbe.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a plan to force all Palestinian civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in order to lay siege to Hamas and force the release of hostages.
     
            It is unclear how many Palestinians remain north of the so-called Netzarim Corridor, which splits Gaza in two, but estimates run into the hundreds of thousands. The plan does not mention whether, when, or how civilians would be allowed to return to northern Gaza. After nearly a year of war, with no part of Gaza immune from Israeli airstrikes, Palestinians have been increasingly unwilling to heed Israeli demands to relocate.
     
            The idea comes from a group of retired Israeli military generals, who have formally presented it to the Israeli cabinet and a powerful parliamentary committee. The goal, they say, is to use siege tactics to starve Hamas fighters and force them to release 101 hostages still held in the territory.
     
        “Those who leave will receive food and water,” Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli military general who is spearheading the proposal, says in a slickly produced video posted online earlier this month. “But in a week the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory, and this military territory as far as we are concerned, no supplies will enter it.”
     
 
            Israeli national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate, reported on Sunday that Netanyahu, in a closed-door meeting with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said that the plan “makes a lot of sense.”

            United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres says he is concerned Lebanon could be transformed into “another Gaza” amid escalating attacks between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            The UN chief told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview aired on Sunday that the recent detonation of communication devices in Lebanon means there is a “potential for a much stronger escalation,” which he fears could be a “devastating tragedy for the world.”
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been trading their most intense fire since the October 7 attacks. The region was already on edge after wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members exploded and Israel killed a top commander in a strike on southern Beirut. 
     
            Guterres also discussed the grinding war between Israel and Hamas and said it was “obvious” to him that neither side wants a ceasefire.
     
        “What is on the table is quite reasonable,” he said, referring to ceasefire proposals to end the fighting. “Both sides should be in a position to accept. And until now, we see that whenever there is a new development, some new complication arises. And it is for me clear that both sides are not interested in a ceasefire.”
     
 
            For months, Israel and Hamas have conducted ceasefire talks through mediators, but discussions have stalled in recent weeks over various disagreements, including the presence of Israeli troops along the Egypt-Gaza border, known as the Philadelphi corridor, after a deal. 
     
            The Middle East’s most formidable non-state fighting force is reeling from the biggest-ever hit to its military structure, as well as the most visible Israeli infiltration of its ranks and communications infrastructure in its more than 40-year history. 
     
            The internal breach enabled the successive blows this week and sowed panic within Hezbollah, according to Lebanese security sources.
     
            In a Saturday news conference, Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi gave an impassioned speech, declaring that the country was in the throes of an Israeli “breach” and vowing to ramp up the monitoring of “foreigners, hotels and Syrian camps.”
     
            The enemy’s firepower had pursued Hezbollah to its lair, attacking rank-and-file and military leadership alike.
     
            Weakened militarily and stripped of its cloak of secrecy, Hezbollah has arrived at the most delicate phase of its decades-long fight against Israel. It hoped that a low-level fight on the border on behalf of the Palestinians would prop up Hamas’ position in the negotiations, but a ceasefire in Gaza seems more elusive than ever before. 
     
            Now its limited confrontation with Israel has exacted a seemingly unlimited price from the militant group. Yet the compulsion to lash out has rarely been greater, bringing the region even closer to the brink of a catastrophic war.
     
Read the full analysis. 
 
            Funerals are taking place across Lebanon for civilians and fighters killed by Israeli projectiles on Friday.
     
            Emergency services are still combing through the rubble left by Friday’s attack that has now killed at least 45 people Lebanon’s health ministry said Sunday. 
     
            In Meis El Jabal, in southern Lebanon, mourners threw rice over the coffins of a family killed in Beirut, in a tradition of celebrating martyrdom. At least two women and two young girls were killed.
     
            It wasn’t clear if the family had resided in Beirut or had moved there to escape the Israeli bombardment in Lebanon’s south.
     
            These photos show the damage to the Al Jazeera offices in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. They were taken by CNN reporters in the region. 
     
            The first shows the entrance to the Al Jazeera office, which has been entirely sealed off with iron doors. The building’s security guard told CNN the doors were installed by the Israeli military. 
     
            The security guard also said that three CCTV cameras were also missing after being confiscated by officers by Israeli soldiers.
     
            And the third image shows damage to the steps of the office after the raid. 
     
            US officials are continuing to urge Israel to de-escalate, amid rising tensions in the north, following cross-border strikes against Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday. 
     
            It is the White House’s view that military escalation will not help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government reach its goals to restore a sense of normalcy for Israelis on Lebanon’s border, stressed Kirby. 
     
            “We don’t believe that escalating this conflict militarily is the best way to get those families back to their Kibuttzes, back to their homes, back to their lives. We still believe that there is time and space for diplomacy to work,” Kirby said on “Fox News Sunday.”
     
            Kirby said US officials are involved in “extensive” efforts, when asked on “ABC This Week” about what the US is doing to move forward diplomatic efforts. 
     
        “We have been involved in extensive and quite assertive diplomacy. In fact, our one of our envoys, Amos Hochstein, who I think you know, was in the region just a few days ago. We will certainly keep up those conversations as best we can. And we’re talking to both sides here,” he said. 
     
 
            Kirby added that they are continuing to watch the escalating tensions with concern. 
     
        “We’re watching with concern the escalating tensions in the region and across that border here in the last week or so. And we don’t believe, continue to not believe, that kinetic action, military action, by either side is really in either side’s best interest […] There’s a better way forward here,” Kirby said. 
     
 
            The National Security Council spokesperson also said that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is the “big obstacle” to any hostage and ceasefire deal, even as he insisted that the US won’t give up on trying to secure a deal. 
     
For context: Israel and Hezbollah have been trading their most intense fire since the October 7 attacks. On Saturday, Israel carried out nearly 300 strikes in what the military said was preemptive action against a planned Hezbollah attack. Overnight, Hezbollah fired scores of rockets and missiles overnight into Israel, striking deeper than they have done in recent attacks.
     
            The head of the Israeli military’s Northern Command has told the heads of local authorities in the area that they have “significantly harmed Hezbollah and we will continue and deepen the blow. We are at a point of change.”
     
            Maj. Gen Ori Gordin met with local leaders Saturday where he told them that they were in a “state of readiness for further offensive plans against Hezbollah.” 
     
            “We will continue to work together with you, in full communication and cooperation,” he added.
     
Recent developments: Hezbollah fired scores of rockets and missiles overnight into Israel, striking deeper than they have done in recent attacks. Most were intercepted but some fell, causing damage. The group says the strikes are in response to repeated Israeli strikes in Lebanon that have led to the deaths of “many civilians.”
     
            The Israeli military said it enforced an order to close Al Jazeera’s offices in the occupied West Bank after an intelligence assessment concluded the premises was being used to “support terrorist activities.” 
     
        “The order was signed following a Legal Opinion and an up-to-date intelligence assessment that determined that the offices were being used to incite terror, to support terrorist activities and that the channel’s broadcasts endanger the security and public order in both the area and the State of Israel as a whole,” the IDF said in a statement Sunday. 
     
 
            In a statement, Al Jazeera said it firmly rejected “the draconian actions, and the unfounded allegations presented by Israeli authorities to justify these illegal raids.”
     
            The network’s equipment was confiscated by the Israeli soldiers, while access to the office space has been blocked off by iron doors, installed by the Israeli military, as seen by a CNN producer who visited the scene on Sunday. 
     
            Speaking at the funeral of Ibrahim Aqil in Beirut today, the second most important figure in Hezbollah said that Israel has committed “war crimes that are painful to us” and as a result, a “battle without limits” has begun.
     
            Aqil was killed in an Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut on Friday, days after hundreds were injured and dozens killed in coordinated attacks targeting Hezbollah fighters, caused by the explosion of pagers and walkie-talkies they were carrying.
     
            Naim Qassem — deputy secretary general of Hezbollah – told Aqil’s funeral that Hezbollah did not need to issue threats, nor specify its response.
     
         “What happened last night was an installment in the battle without limits,” Qassem said, referring to rocket attacks against Israel on Saturday night which penetrated deep into Israeli territory. Qassem said Israel “committed three war crimes that were painful to us,” and that its recent attacks “represent the highest level of monstrosity which we have never seen anything like in this era.”“We acknowledge that you hurt us. We are human. However when we are in pain, you will also be in pain.”
     
 
            Qassem said Israel would not achieve its goals and that support from Lebanon for Gaza would persist, no matter what, until the war on Gaza ends.
     
            Broadcaster Al Jazeera has condemned the Israeli military raid and closure of its offices in the occupied West Bank as a “criminal act” and has vowed to continue its journalism coverage of the war in Gaza.
     
        “The network vehemently condemns and denounces this criminal act by the Israeli occupation forces. Al Jazeera reject the draconian actions, and the unfounded allegations presented by Israeli authorities to justify these illegal raids,” Al Jazeera said in a statement. 
     
 
            Al Jazeera broadcast live footage of Israeli soldiers entering its offices and ordering its closure for 45 days. In the video, Al Jazeera bureau chief Walid Omary read out the military order received, informing staff members they had only ten minutes to take their personal belongings and cameras and vacate the office.
     
            In the broadcast footage, when Omary asked the Israeli soldiers why the office was being closed, he was told the reason had been provided in the written military order.
     
            “These oppressive measures are clearly intended to prevent the world from witnessing the reality of the situation in the occupied territories and the ongoing war on Gaza and the devastating impact on innocent civilians,” Al Jazeera added in its statement. 
     
            The broadcaster promised to continue to hold the Israeli government “responsible for the safety of its journalists” and to “pursue all available legal channels through international legal institutions to protect both its rights and its journalists.” 
     
            Al Jazeera’s office in Ramallah has been operational for decades. It became even more essential for the network after Israel shut down its Jerusalem office and seized some of its communication equipment in May, prompting condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups over what they said were Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s moves to restrict press freedoms.
     
            A security guard who was on shift when Israeli soldiers raided the Al Jazeera office in Ramallah has told CNN that soldiers used explosives to breach the building’s entrance. 
     
        “My eyes were heavy, and I was almost asleep when I suddenly saw them breaking the main door,” said Abu Amer, the security guard. “I stood up to see what they were doing. They threw the first bomb and then the second.”“I tried to run away to the stairs and get some distance from them. I was so scared.”
     
 
            At the scene, CNN found extensive damage to the exterior and interior of the building where the Al Jazeera office is based, which also houses several stores and other offices. The main door of the office was missing and several steps leading up to the building were damaged. 
     
            Al Jazeera condemned the raid, which happened in the early hours of Sunday morning, calling it a “criminal act by the Israeli occupation forces” based on “unfounded allegations.” Staff working in the office were given only ten minutes to take their personal belongings and vacate the office, which has been given a military order to close for 45 days.

            The funeral is underway in southern Beirut of one of Hezbollah’s most senior figures, Ibrahim Aqil.
     
            Aqil was one of 16 Hezbollah commanders and fighters killed in an Israeli missile strike on Friday.
     
            A CNN team attending the funeral said it is being held at a closed-off intersection in southern Beirut. Security is tight — a dog was sniffing the surrounding streets for explosives as the CNN team made their way to the gathering. 
     
            Mourners sat on plastic chairs looking at a gate draped in yellow through which the coffin of Aqil is expected to be passed. 
     
            A statement from Hezbollah Saturday invited the ‘people of resistance’ to the funerals of Aqil and Mahmoud Hamad, with the procession ending at the Rawdat al-Hawraa Zainab cemetery in Ghobeiry, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
     
            Ibrahim Aqil led Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, and was assassinated along with several other commanders.
     
Some background: Aqil had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States for his suspected involvement in the 1983 strike on the US Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, as well as the bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year.
     
            CNN reporter Sarah Sirgany is at the funeral of Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil in Beirut, Lebanon. 
     
            Aqil was one of 16 Hezbollah commanders and fighters killed in an Israeli missile strike on southern Beirut on Friday.
     
            A statement from Hezbollah invited the “people of resistance” to the funerals of Aqil and Mahmoud Hamad in southern Beirut, with the procession ending at the Rawdat al-Hawraa Zainab cemetery in Ghobeiry, in the southern suburbs of Beirut. 
     
This is how Sirgany described the scene shortly before the funeral began:
 
        “Everything about the funeral of Hezbollah Commander Ibrahim Aqil is unusual,” Sirgany said. “Instead of the main Martyrs hall in which such high profiles funerals and events are held, this funeral is held in a closed off intersection in southern Beirut. A televised speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, also customary for a top leader, is not on the agenda.”“A dog was sniffing the surrounding streets for explosives as CNN team made their way to the gathering,” she added. “Mourners sat on plastic chairs looking at a gate draped in yellow through which the coffin of the slain leader is expected to be passed. The march band stood in attention as Quran verses flowed on loudspeakers.”
     
 
            A 16-year-old who was injured in Kiryat Bialik this morning has described the moment a Hezbollah rocket blew the door from her house as she hid in the shelter with her parents, siblings and grandfather.
     
        “We closed the door, the window, everything was locked. The explosion took out the [house’s] door from its position. We had two rockets hitting — one in the yard, and one in the access road across from the house,” Linoy Amzaleg said speaking from the Rambam hospital with visible cuts to her face.
     
 
            “There was a loud boom in the air and a flame started from the explosion. It shattered our shelter’s window, the entire metal window moved out of its place, the glass broke, and the cars were set on fire. The explosion of the cars hit the window and resulted in shrapnel hitting my face,” she said.
     
            Amzaleg said the family sought shelter for ten minutes before leaving and as she wiped her face, she felt blood running down the side.
     
            “I’m now suffering from headaches, my face is in pain, the side’s a bit swollen, and I still have some glasses and there’s anxiety. I keep rewinding it, again and again… If we weren’t inside the sheltered room, we wouldn’t stand here [alive] today,” she added.
     
            Hezbollah retaliated overnight to a week of intensive Israeli attacks in Lebanon by launching a barrage of projectiles that targeted areas farther into Israeli territory than most of its previous strikes. 
     
            The Israeli military said that it intercepted most of the airborne weapons but reported impacts in Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom and Moreshet near the port city of Haifa, around 40 km (25 miles) south of the border. 
     
CNN’s Tamara Qiblawi contributed to this report.
 
            Hezbollah has fired projectiles targeting areas farther into Israeli territory than the majority previous strikes on Sunday, with the last 48 hours bringing the most intense exchanges of fire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group since October 7. 
     
            Two people were killed in fresh Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon on Sunday morning, Lebanese media reported, with exchanges of fire continuing after Israel pounded Hezbollah targets with nearly 300 strikes overnight. 
     
            Hezbollah has been left reeling after two days of blasts targeting pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members was followed by an Israeli strike on southern Beirut, which killed a top commander and other senior operatives.
     
Below are the latest on tensions between Hezbollah and Israel:
 
Below are the latest updates on the conflict in Gaza: 
 
            The Ministry of Health in Gaza says that the bodies of 40 people have been brought into hospitals over the past 24 hours and that 58 people have been injured as a result of Israeli military operations.
     
        “Some victims are still under the rubble and on the roads where ambulance and civil defense teams cannot reach them,” the Ministry added. 
     
 
            CNN reported Saturday on the deaths of at least 22 people in a strike on a school compound in central Gaza. There was at least one other strike resulting in fatalities in southern Gaza Saturday.
     
            The cumulative death toll in Gaza since October 7 is now 41,431, with over 95,000 people injured, according to the Ministry. 
     
            Hezbollah retaliated overnight to a week of intensive Israeli attacks in Lebanon by launching a barrage of projectiles that targeted areas farther into Israeli territory than most of its previous strikes. 
     
            The Israeli military said that it intercepted most of the airborne weapons but reported impacts in Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom and Moreshet near the port city of Haifa, around 40 km (25 miles) south of the border. This marks one of the deepest direct hits by the Iran-backed group since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.
     
            Hezbollah said it targeted the Ramat David airbase southeast of Haifa with Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 missiles, two previously unknown weapons that may have a longer range than those normally used by the Lebanese militant group. Hezbollah attacks have largely involved short-range Katyusha and Burkan rockets as well as attack and surveillance drones. 
     
            The Israeli military did not respond to queries about whether the Ramat David airbase was impacted. Israeli emergency services reported three people were wounded in the attacks. 
     
            Hezbollah boasts an arsenal of short, medium and long-range missiles. In his previous speeches, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that the group had yet to use some of its most sophisticated weaponry.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that in the past few days “We have struck Hezbollah with a series of blows it didn’t imagine.” 
     
            “If Hezbollah didn’t get the message - I assure you - they will get the message. We are determined to return our citizens in the north to their homes safely,” said the prime minister, speaking ahead of a government meeting on Sunday. 
     
        “No country can tolerate incoming fire against its citizens, incoming fire against its cities. And we too, the state of Israel, won’t tolerate it. We will do anything necessary to restore the security,” he said. 
     
 
            Speaking from an air force command and control room, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that “Hezbollah has started to sense some of the IDF’s capabilities, and there’s already a difficult feeling there that we’re after them, and we’re seeing the results.” 
     
Some context: Israel carried out some of its most intense strikes on Lebanon against Hezbollah since the October 7 attacks, striking thousands of launchers on Saturday after it said it uncovered plans for a Hezbollah rocket attack. On Friday, at least 45 people were killed, including high-level Hezbollah commanders, in an Israeli strike on southern Beirut.
     
            These strikes followed the detonation of walkie-talkies in Lebanon earlier this week, which killed at least 20 people and pager blasts targeting Hezbollah members which killed at least 12, including children, and injured thousands across the country.  
     
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Sunday that “Israel is not interested to be at war with Lebanon” while accusing Hezbollah of being behind the military escalation between both nations. 
     
            “We do not want to move to get into a war with Lebanon, but Lebanon has been hijacked by a terror organization which is also a political party in Lebanon called Hezbollah,” he told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips.
     
            Herzog said Hezbollah had been “armed to its teeth by the Iranian empire of evil,” and that the leaders killed in the Friday attack on southern Beirut were “meeting together in order to launch the same horrific, horrendous attack that we had on October 7 by Hamas.” 
     
            The president reiterated Israel “did not seek this war”, which “was instigated by the Empire of Evil, the Iranian proxies in the region, under the command of Iran,” and that his country is only focusing on defending itself. 
     
            “Think for a moment, had the Bournemouth citizens been evacuated to Manchester for a year under attacks from one of the neighbors or Brighton, how long would the British government be restrained?” Herzog asked, referring to cities in northern and southern England. 
     
            “We are working to change this equation,” he said, adding that Israel needed to ensure the return of hostages and secure itself from an attack from Lebanon. “It’s very simple, and life can go on in a peaceful manner on an internationally recognized boundary between Israel and Lebanon,” he concluded. 
     
            Two people have been killed amid a fresh wave of over 60 Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon since dawn on Sunday, the official National News Agency (NNA) in Lebanon has said. 
     
            The two people killed were in Al-Khiyyam and Aitaroun, the Lebanese health ministry said. 
     
            NNA said that the latest wave of strikes hit villages in Nabatiyah and Mahmoudiya - as well as al-Adissa and Yaroun close to the border.
     
            The latest round of airstrikes come after Israeli aircraft carried out nearly 300 strikes on multiple locations in eastern and southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours. 
     
            An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said that the strikes occurred after plans were detected for a Hezbollah rocket attack. 
     
            Reports from Gaza say that seven people were killed Sunday morning in an Israeli airstrike on another school compound, after 22 were killed in a similar strike on a school where thousands were sheltering in central Gaza on Saturday. 
     
            The Israeli military says the compound was being used as a Hamas base.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that following intelligence leads, the air force “conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip. The terrorists were operating from within a compound that previously served as the ‘Kafr Qasem’ School.” 
     
            Prior to the strike, the IDF said, “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harm to uninvolved civilians.”  
     
            A CNN stringer in Gaza reports that in addition to the seven killed in the strike, others were badly injured. The Kafr Qasem school houses hundreds of displaced people in a camp west of Gaza City. Casualties were transferred to Al Ahli Hospital in the city.
     
            Among those killed was a senior manager in the Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Gaza, Majed Saleh.
     
            The Israeli military has struck a number of school compounds sheltering the displaced in recent weeks. On Saturday, 22 people – most of them women and children – were reported killed in an Israeli strike on a school compound in Zeitoun, in central Gaza.
     
            The Israeli military said the compound was being used as a Hamas command center, and precautions had been taken to avoid civilian casualties. CNN is unable to verify whether Hamas operatives were present at the compound or whether Hamas fighters were among the casualties.

            The last 48 hours have seen the most intense exchanges of fire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah since October 7 - with Hezbollah firing rockets deep into northern Israel early Sunday.
     
            On Saturday, Israel pounded Hezbollah targets with nearly 300 strikes, in what the military said was pre-emptive action to ward off a major attack. Further strikes continued Sunday. Lebanon’s official news agency said there had been 60 strikes on villages in southern Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah has been left reeling after two days of blasts targeting pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members was followed by an Israeli strike on southern Beirut, which killed a top commander and other senior operatives.
     
Below are the latest developments: 
 
            The Israeli military says it intercepted an aerial target that crossed into Israeli territory from the east early Sunday.
     
            The interception followed a heavy barrage of rockets from southern Lebanon overnight. About 85 were fired around 6:30 a.m. local time (11:30p ET Saturday), after approximately 20 were fired earlier, the military said.
     
        Following sirens in the southern Golan area, the air force “successfully intercepted a suspicious aerial target that crossed into Israeli territory from the east. Rocket and missile sirens sounded following the possibility of fallen shrapnel from the interception. No damage or injuries were reported,” the IDF said. 
     
 
            The IDF added that fighter jets continued to strike “dozens of Hezbollah terror targets, including launchers and military structures in dozens of areas in southern Lebanon” on Sunday, after reporting 290 strikes since Saturday, some of the most intense since the October 7 attacks. 
     
            Al Jazeera has broadcast live footage of Israeli soldiers raiding its offices in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, and ordering its closure for 45 days.
     
            The footage showed the network’s bureau chief Walid Omary and staff members live on air as Israeli soldiers entered.
     
            Video broadcast by Al Jazeera showed one soldier informing Omary of a military order to close Al Jazeera’s office for 45 days. The soldier then told Omary that staff members need to leave the office immediately. 
     
            Reading the military order given to him on air, Omary said staff members need to take their personal belongings and cameras and leave.
     
            Al Jazeera’s office in Ramallah has been operational for decades. It became even more essential for the network after Israel shut down its Jerusalem office and seized some of its communication equipment in May, prompting condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups over what they said were Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s moves to restrict press freedoms.
     
            After Al Jazeera staff had left the Ramallah office, live footage showed Omary and others in the street outside, as the journalist said soldiers had taken over the office and were confiscating materials.
     
            Shortly after, as Israeli soldiers approached Omary, the live video feed was cut, and Omary was heard saying that soldiers had taken the camera and broadcast equipment the team were using.
     
            CNN has contacted Al Jazeera and Israel’s military for comment.
     
            Under the Oslo Peace Accords, the Palestinian Authority has responsibility for security in “Area A” of the occupied West Bank, which includes Ramallah.

            The death toll from an Israeli strike on southern Beirut that targeted several Hezbollah commanders on Friday has risen to 45, Lebanon’s health ministry said Sunday.
     
            Emergency services are still combing through the rubble left by the attack, it said, using DNA samples to identify the remains.
     
            A day earlier, the death toll had stood at 38, according to the ministry.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly amid escalating tensions with Hezbollah.
     
            The prime minister had already pushed his departure from Tuesday to Wednesday, but “for now” plans to leave Friday, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            Netanyahu is set to speak at the General Assembly later in the week, which is expected to lead to a lot of walkouts from the assembly hall.
     
Some context: The United Nations General Assembly is an annual world leaders’ summit that has gone on for nearly eight decades. It’s a place for long speeches, private country-to-country whisper sessions, and group meetings on everything from regulating artificial intelligence to global conflicts.
     
            This year features a UN once again caught in a debate over its relevancy while attempting to stem wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan. According to Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, Netanyahu “hates the organization and he has a deep mistrust of it.” Read more.
     
            More than 100 “projectiles” have been fired from Lebanon into Israel overnight, the Israeli military has said, as Israel and Hezbollah ramp up cross-border attacks. 
     
            About 85 were fired around 6:30 a.m. local time, after approximately 20 were fired about 90 minutes earlier, the military said. 
     
            “Some of the projectiles were intercepted, and fallen projectiles were identified in the areas of Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom, and Moreshet,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.  
     
            Video in Israeli media showed cars on fire on a street corner in the northern town of Kiryat Bialik. Footage released by the Israeli Fire and Rescue Service showed charred cars and buildings with blown-out windows. 
     
            Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency services said it has treated four people for shrapnel injuries overnight – three with minor injuries and one with moderate injuries. 
     
            The Israeli military also said it is “currently striking targets belonging” to Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying those attacks will “continue and will intensify.”  
     
            Hezbollah overnight said that it had fired rockets towards Israel, saying it targeted the Ramat David air base in two separate incidents.  
     
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the claim. 
     
            In a separate statement, Hezbollah said it also targeted RAFAEL, an Israeli military technologies company based in the Haifa area in northern Israel. 
     
            The group’s statement said targeting RAFAEL is in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and “an initial response to the brutal massacre” committed by Israel on Tuesday and Wednesday. That was a reference to deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members – with pagers simultaneously exploding across the country on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion on Wednesday. 
     
            The Israeli military told CNN that they are not aware of these claims.  
     
            CNN is also trying to reach out to RAFAEL for comment on the claim by Hezbollah.  
     
            Hezbollah says it has launched “tens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2” rockets toward Ramat David air base in northern Israel for a second time on Sunday. The rockets, Hezbollah says, are in response to repeated Israeli strikes in Lebanon that have led to the deaths of “many civilians.”  
     
            Hezbollah had earlier said that it launched “tens of rockets” at the Ramat David base. CNN had reached out to the Israeli military for comment but has yet to hear back.  
     
            On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit to Ramat David base that Israel is at the “beginning of a new era in this war.” 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces announced new restrictions on public activities Sunday in northern Israel and parts of the Golan Heights as its fighting with Hezbollah ramps up.
     
            From 6 a.m. this morning local time through Monday evening, schools will be closed. Gatherings will be limited to 10 people outdoors and 100 people inside, according to the IDF.
     
            Beaches will also be closed to the public. Work-related activities can continue as long as shelter is nearby. 
     
            Among areas affected by the new rules are the the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and upper and lower Galiliee.
     
            The military earlier raised restrictions for much of the north, warning of a possible Hezbollah attack “within a short time frame.”
     
            The Israeli military says about 10 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel overnight.
     
            All but one were intercepted, the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
            A man was “very lightly scratched” by shrapnel from an interception near a village in the Lower Galilee, according to a spokesperson for Israel’s national emergency service MDA. 
     
            “MDA medics and paramedics are providing treatment at the scene for a 60-year-old man in a very mild condition,” the spokesperson said.
     
            Israeli police said falling debris from projectiles fired from Lebanon had caused a fire and damaged property in Israel’s Northern District.
     
            Firefighting units are working to contain the flames, while police bomb disposal experts are searching the area, authorities said.
     
            Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The group’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war has been palpable — Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in skirmishes since the war began, putting the entire region on a knife’s edge with fears it could spark a wider regional conflict.
     
            This is the latest in a decades-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Here’s what to know:
     
Israeli invasion: Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory when it invaded Lebanon in 1982. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reportsand an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Beirut refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila. It’s one of the bloodiest events in the region’s recent history. The investigation, known as the Kahan Commission of Inquiry, held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000.
     
The rise of Hezbollah: As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon’s fractious political landscape. The ragtag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, plus some civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
A “supportive front” for Gaza in 2023: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has engaged in increased clashes with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started on October 7, 2023. The alliance said it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding itself as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader.
     
Killing of key leader: After months of tit-for-tat exchanges, tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, with a strike on Beirut in July. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles at targets in Israel in August. Israel denied any important targets were struck, and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Israel has made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. Officials and residents from the northern region have placed increasing pressure on the Israeli government about the need to return. More than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
Latest attack: Hezbollah confirmed that senior commander Ibrahim Aqil was killed. Israel said Aqil was among senior Hezbollah figures who were killed in an airstrike on a residential building in Beirut. Lebanon was already reeling after thousands of small blasts hit Hezbollah members’ pagers and walkie-talkies during the week, killing dozens and wounding thousands.
     
            Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi said Saturday that the recent attacks in the country have compelled the government to closely monitor the movement of foreigners and hotel activities. 
     
            The government will “intensify our efforts, especially intelligence and security efforts on the ground,” Mawlawi said. 
     
        “In recent days, weeks, and months, a large number of martyrs and innocent Lebanese civilians, including children and women, have fallen due to security operations and targeted attacks by the Israeli enemy,” the minister told reporters.“We will closely monitor the movement of foreigners, hotel activities, and closely monitor Syrian and Palestinian camps. We will also pay greater attention to anything that might lead to internal security instability,” he added.
     
 
            Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The group’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war has been palpable — Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in skirmishes since the war began, putting the entire region on a knife’s edge with fears it could spark a wider regional conflict.
     
Here’s what to know about Hezbollah
 
Origins: The group emerged from the rubble of Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, when Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reports, and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Beirut refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila. It’s one of the bloodiest events in the region’s recent history. The investigation, known as the Kahan Commission of Inquiry, held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000.
     
            As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon’s fractious political landscape. The ragtag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, plus some civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
Support from Iran: The group made no secret about its ideological allegiance to Tehran and received a steady flow of funds from the Islamic Republic. This helped propel Hezbollah to prominence. It became a participant in Lebanon’s civil war, which ended in 1990, and led a fight against Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon, ultimately driving them out in 2000.
     
A terror designation: In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization, largely since Argentina blamed the group for the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, killing 85, also in the capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah denied responsibility for those attacks.

            The “risk of escalation is real” between Israel and Hezbollah, amid a moment where the threat is “more acute,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Saturday.
     
        “It stands to reason that Lebanese Hezbollah’s capabilities have taken a hit. How significant a hit, and how that translates to their ability to represent a threat to Israel, I think we still need some more time assessment to reach more engagements on,” Sullivan said ahead of Saturday’s Quad summit in Wilmington, Delaware. “The risk of escalation is real. It has been since October 7. There are moments where it is more acute than others. I think we are in one of those moments where it is more acute.” 
     
 
            Asked if the Israeli strike in southern Beirut that killed at least 37 people, including high-level commanders of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, was an escalation in his view, Sullivan pushed back, saying that “the United States is not going to score keep like that.”
     
        “When I talk about escalation, I mean where, where does this take us? From the point of view of, are we going to end up in a wider war? We’re not there yet. I hope we do not get there,” Sullivan said. 
     
 
            He continued, “There’s a number of different ways to look at this strike. The chief way I personally look at it goes back to the discussion we were having before, which is, it was a strike against a senior terrorist who has both Israeli and American blood on his hands.”
     
Remember: The strike in southern Beirut killed high-level figures of Hezbollah, including Ibrahim Aqil, the leader of an elite unit who had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States for his suspected involvement in the 1983 strike on the US Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, as well as the bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year.

            Hezbollah says it has launched “tens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2” rockets toward Ramat David air base in northern Israel for a second time on Sunday. The rockets, Hezbollah says, are in response to repeated Israeli strikes in Lebanon that have led to the deaths of “many civilians.”  
     
            Hezbollah had earlier said that it launched “tens of rockets” at the Ramat David base. CNN had reached out to the Israeli military for comment but has yet to hear back.  
     
            On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit to Ramat David base that Israel is at the “beginning of a new era in this war.” 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces announced new restrictions on public activities Sunday in northern Israel and parts of the Golan Heights as its fighting with Hezbollah ramps up.
     
            From 6 a.m. this morning local time through Monday evening, schools will be closed. Gatherings will be limited to 10 people outdoors and 100 people inside, according to the IDF.
     
            Beaches will also be closed to the public. Work-related activities can continue as long as shelter is nearby. 
     
            Among areas affected by the new rules are the the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and upper and lower Galiliee.
     
            The military earlier raised restrictions for much of the north, warning of a possible Hezbollah attack “within a short time frame.”
     
            Al Jazeera has broadcast live footage of Israeli soldiers entering its offices in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, and ordering its closure for 45 days.
     
            The footage showed the network’s bureau chief Walid Omary and staff members live on air as Israeli soldiers entered.
     
            Video broadcast by Al Jazeera showed one soldier informing Omary of a military order to close Al Jazeera’s office for 45 days. The soldier then told Omary that staff members need to leave the office immediately. 
     
            Reading the military order given to him on air, Omary said staff members need to take their personal belongings and cameras and leave.
     
            Al Jazeera’s office in Ramallah has been operational for decades. It became even more essential for the network after Israel shut down its Jerusalem office and seized some of its communication equipment in May, prompting condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups over what they said were Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s moves to restrict press freedoms.
     
            After Al Jazeera staff had left the Ramallah office, live footage showed Omary and others in the street outside, as the journalist said soldiers had taken over the office and were confiscating materials.
     
            Shortly after, as Israeli soldiers approached Omary, the live video feed was cut, and Omary was heard saying that soldiers had taken the camera and broadcast equipment the team were using.
     
            CNN has contacted Al Jazeera and Israel’s military for comment.
     
WATCH via Al Jazeera:
 
            Hezbollah says it has launched “tens of rockets” at the Ramat David air base in northern Israel in retaliation for strikes carried out by the Israeli military in Lebanon.
     
            The Israeli military says about 10 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel overnight.
     
            All but one were intercepted, the Israel Defense Forces said.
     
            A man was “very lightly scratched” by shrapnel from an interception near a village in the Lower Galilee, according to a spokesperson for Israel’s national emergency service MDA. 
     
            “MDA medics and paramedics are providing treatment at the scene for a 60-year-old man in a very mild condition,” the spokesperson said.
     
            Israeli police said falling debris from projectiles fired from Lebanon had caused a fire and damaged property in Israel’s Northern District.
     
            Firefighting units are working to contain the flames, while police bomb disposal experts are searching the area, authorities said.
     
            The family of slain hostage Carmel Gat says it takes “no comfort” in the Israeli military’s announcement that it has killed two of her captors.
     
            The family thanked Israeli soldiers for risking their lives but said Carmel “wouldn’t have minded” whether the militants were dead or alive.
     
            “She would have wanted to know that the hostages returned home alive,” the family said, according to a spokesperson of the Be’eri kibbutz from where she was taken.
     
        “The answer to death isn’t more death. It is life,” the family said.
     
 
            It also called on the government to strike a deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages and prevent a “regional escalation – before it’s too late.”
     
            Earlier on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had killed two captors of the six hostages it says were slain by Hamas in a Gaza tunnel last month.
     
            The military “eliminated” the two men during a confrontation in the area of Tel Al-Sultan, a day after the hostages were killed, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at a briefing.
     
            Israel determined the two men were among the captors based on DNA evidence from equipment inside the tunnel and other items the pair carried with them, Hagari said.
     
            He added that officials were still determining their exact involvement in the killing of the hostages.
     
            The US Embassy in Lebanon is urging American citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial flights are available due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. 
     
            The US State Department issued an updated travel advisory on Saturday, warning Americans: “Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, unexploded landmines, and the risk of armed conflict.”
     
            The level-four advisory – the highest issued by the State Department – said that US citizens in southern Lebanon, near the borders with Syria or in refugee settlements should “depart those areas immediately,” citing potential cross-border attacks and clashes between security forces and “extremist” groups.
     
            Those who decide to remain in the country should be prepared to shelter in place if the situation worsens, the alert said.
     
            Veteran Israeli politician Gideon Sa’ar says he won’t take the post of defense minister following speculation that he could replace the current minister Yoav Gallant.
     
            Sa’ar withdrew from consideration in light of the security situation along the border with Lebanon, he said in a statement Saturday.
     
            Still, he insisted that he is qualified to hold the position, saying a defense minister “needs to obtain deep knowledge on security and diplomatic affairs and have experience as a member of government … I have such experience. I have such an understanding.” 
     
            He added that the role should not be held by someone from the “defense establishment,” saying Israel’s biggest military and strategic failures had occurred while the job was held by those who came from within the military.
     
            The announcement follows speculation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to oust Gallant, a retired major general who served for decades in the Israel Defense Forces, and replace him with Sa’ar, a near-lifelong politician.
     
            Protesters in Tel Aviv are calling for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down and be “replaced with someone who can bring about a hostage release deal.”
     
            Demonstrations took place in multiple cities across Israel on Saturday, including in Caesarea, Haifa and Jerusalem. In Tel Aviv, protesters chanted “we will not give up” and waved signs calling on the government to bring the hostages home.
     
            The Hostages and Families Forum Headquarters, a group representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, told CNN the protesters wanted Netanyahu to make way for another leader who could secure a hostage deal. 
     
            The group said Israel’s government had “failed miserably” on October 7, and “for almost a year now, it has failed to make amends.” 
     
        “We will keep demanding it own up to its failure and bring all the hostages back home,” the group said.
     
 
            The protest in Tel Aviv also heard from some of the family members of the hostages.
     
        “We have warned that it’s either a deal or a regional escalation, and that the hostages must be returned first,” said Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker. “But now everyone can see that Netanyahu chose a regional escalation and decided to sacrifice the hostages on the altar of maintaining his regime,” she added.
     
 
            Ifat Kalderon, cousin of hostage Ofer Kalderon, said, “The only way to save those still alive is a deal. Remove Netanyahu from his position so someone else can bring about a deal.” 
     
            The Israeli police said it deployed “significant resources” to intervene at a demonstration where fires had been ignited on Begin Road near the IDF’s headquarters in Tel Aviv. 
     
            One person was taken into custody for allegedly rolling a tire into the protest with the intent to ignite it during a procession on Namir Street in Tel Aviv, police said.
     
            Israel is “extensively striking” southern Lebanon after uncovering plans for a Hezbollah rocket attack on its territory, according to Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.
     
            The intensity of airstrikes Saturday is among the highest recorded since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel last year in support of Hamas amid Israel’s war in Gaza.
     
            The Israeli government warned a possible Hezbollah attack could happen “within a short time frame.” Citizens are under expanded restrictions amidst the warnings.

            At least 82 people have been killed in Lebanon over the past few days as a result of Israeli attacks and the detonation of communication devices, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told Al Jazeera Saturday.
     
            Thirty-eight of them were killed in the strike on southern Beirut that targeted several Hezbollah commanders on Friday, Abiad said. Among them were three children and seven women. Search and rescue operations are still ongoing. 
     
            Some 2,950 people were injured by the pager detonations, Abiad said. Of those, 777 are still in hospital and 152 in critical condition. 
     
            Many of the injured have lost their vision partially or completely, Abiad said, adding that some 2,087 surgeries have been conducted so far. 
     
            The vast majority of the injured were civilians who were in stores and supermarkets at the time of the attacks, the minister said, describing Israel’s actions as a “war crime.”
     
            A day after an Israeli airstrike leveled a building in Beirut’s southern district and Hezbollah stronghold, rescue teams on Saturday dug through the rubble in search of survivors. 
     
            As funerals were held for some of the more than 30 people killed in the attack, hopes for those still missing were beginning to fade.
     
            Still, families waited for news on a nearby street, as others walked away in tears. Some tired ambulance and civil defense workers took turns to rest nearby, their clothes covered in dust. 
     
            The strike leveled one building and damaged several in the densely clustered neighborhood and its narrow streets. 
     
            Warning of a possible Hezbollah attack “within a short time frame,” the Israeli government is extending emergency guidelines further south for civilians, limiting public and outdoors gatherings.
     
            For months, the guidelines have already been in force for Israel’s northernmost communities. But with rising fears of Hezbollah retaliation for a number of Israeli attacks in Lebanon this week, the rules will now apply “from Haifa northward,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in an address Saturday.
     
        “⁠It is possible that within a short time frame, rockets and additional threats will be launched into Israel,” Hagari said. “We ask you to follow the Home Front Command guidelines. We’re going through days of combat, so it’s important to remain alerted.”
     
 
            Under the guidelines, beaches are closed, outdoors gatherings are limited to 30 people and indoor gatherings are limited to 300 people. Workplaces and schools may continue operating as long as a shelter is available.
     
            Israel said it is “extensively striking” southern Lebanon after uncovering plans for a Hezbollah rocket attack on its territory.
     
            Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said dozens of Israeli fighter jets are striking the launchers that the military claims were to be used in the attack.
     
        “Overall, today we’ve struck approximately 400 Hezbollah launchers,” Hagari said during a news conference Saturday evening local time, adding that Israel is “striking methodologically, taking away more and more of Hezbollah’s launching capabilities (and) eliminating commanders and terrorists.”
     
 
            Hagari said the IDF struck southern Beirut’s Dahiyeh neighborhood on Friday, killing senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil and 15 other commanders that were plotting to strike Israel.
     
            “They met in order to plan terror attacks and infiltrations into Israel territory. But we knew where they were and got ahead of them with a precise and powerful operation,” Hagari said.
     
            The Israeli military said it is carrying out a new wave of strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces did not provide details on the scale of the strikes or the exact location.
     
            Lebanese state news agency NNA reported that more than 50 air raids happened in multiple parts of southern Lebanon in less than 40 minutes on Saturday night local time.
     
            Planes targeted towns in the western part of the country, including Tir Harfa, Shihin, Al-Jibeen, Zibqin and Al-Duhayra, NNA reported.
     
            Heavy drone activity was observed during strikes targeting the outskirts of Tuffahta and Al-Baysariya, according to the agency. Other strikes were reported around the Deir Amas valley in the Tyre district.
     
            Hundreds of mourners gathered outside a cemetery in Dahiyeh, Beirut’s southern district and a Hezbollah stronghold, for funerals for the militant group’s fighters and members for the third time this week.
     
            Yellow sachets mark families of the dead in the crowd of mourners, this time bidding farewell following Israel’s strike on southern Beirut on Friday.
     
            Zahraa was wearing a badge with a picture of her 18-year-old son, who was killed in 2008, while she consoled a friend who lost a son in Friday’s attack. 
     
        “Four of Om Hassan’s children were martyred. I was shy approaching her. What could I possibly tell her? She was the one consoling me. She has four martyrs and she holds her head high,” Zahraa told CNN.
     
 
            In the crowd, some of those wounded from the pager and walkie-talkie blasts this week could be spotted through their injuries. A man with a bruised face and a patch covering his eye told CNN he was injured this week. He waved his bandaged hands, signaling he didn’t want to elaborate.
     
            It’s been a week of funerals, but Hezbollah members and supporters told CNN their morale remains high. Om Fadel lost her brother early in this conflict and says other family members were injured in Friday’s strike.
     
        “Israel is the enemy. They couldn’t kill the men on the front line, so it’s resorting to this treacherous attack,” she said.
     
 
            “Yes, loss is difficult, but patience and time heal wounds. Victory is the most important thing,” she said. “We won’t back down.” 
     
            Zahraa said her other children are on the same path as her killed son. 
     
            “If we all told our children to stay home, who would defend us?” she said. “We are defending a nation, not a specific sect. We are defending the Sunnis, the Christians, the Armenians, the Druze. Our sons are defending the borders of this country.”
     
            Lebanon’s state news agency NNA reported that Israeli aircraft carried out a total of 111 airstrikes in one hour on Saturday. 
     
            It said the strikes occurred between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. local time.
     
        “The Israeli enemy’s aircraft carried out a series of violent airstrikes on areas in Nabatieh, Iqlim al-Tuffah, and Western Bekaa,” according to NNA.
     
 
            The Israel Defense Forces earlier said about 180 targets have been struck in southern Lebanon on Saturday. According to the IDF, approximately 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel.
     
For context: The intensity of airstrikes Saturday is among the highest recorded since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel last year in support of Hamas amid Israel’s war in Gaza.
     
            In late August, the Israeli military said about 100 fighter jets had “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels” in more than 40 areas of southern Lebanon in one day. 
     
            About 180 targets have been struck in southern Lebanon on Saturday, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
     
            The Israeli Air Force “struck thousands of launcher barrels that were ready for immediate use to fire toward Israeli territory,” the IDF said.  
     
        “Additionally, IDF artillery struck a number of areas in southern Lebanon,” it added. The IDF said it will “continue operating to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities and terror infrastructure.”
     
 
            Lebanese media reported Israeli strikes in a wide area of southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday, saying they also caused forest fires.
     
            Fires broke out in northern Israel as well, after Hezbollah claimed to have fired multiple barrages into the country on Saturday, including targeting the Israeli military’s Beit Hillel barracks with Katyusha rockets. The IDF earlier said that approximately 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel. 
     
            The “risk of escalation is real” between Israel and Hezbollah, amid a moment where the threat is “more acute,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Saturday.
     
        “It stands to reason that Lebanese Hezbollah’s capabilities have taken a hit. How significant a hit, and how that translates to their ability to represent a threat to Israel, I think we still need some more time assessment to reach more engagements on,” Sullivan said ahead of Saturday’s Quad summit in Wilmington, Delaware. “The risk of escalation is real. It has been since October 7. There are moments where it is more acute than others. I think we are in one of those moments where it is more acute.” 
     
 
            Asked if the Israeli strike in southern Beirut that killed at least 37 people, including high-level commanders of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, was an escalation in his view, Sullivan pushed back, saying that “the United States is not going to score keep like that.”
     
        “When I talk about escalation, I mean where, where does this take us? From the point of view of, are we going to end up in a wider war? We’re not there yet. I hope we do not get there,” Sullivan said. 
     
 
            He continued, “There’s a number of different ways to look at this strike. The chief way I personally look at it goes back to the discussion we were having before, which is, it was a strike against a senior terrorist who has both Israeli and American blood on his hands.”
     
Remember: Friday’s strike in southern Beirut killed high-level figures of Hezbollah, including Ibrahim Aqil, the leader of an elite unit who had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States for his suspected involvement in the 1983 strike on the US Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, as well as the bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year.
     
            Israeli strikes have been reported in a wide area of southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday, according to Lebanese media. 
     
            The state news agency NNA said the areas bombarded included near Jezzine and areas south of the city of Sidon, as well as the western Beqaa valley.
     
            Israeli warplanes “carried out a series of intense airstrikes in multiple rounds, targeting the valley between the towns of Ansar and Zrarieh (south of Sidon),” a nearby valley close to the town of Zefta, and another area close to Deir al-Zahrani, also southeast of Sidon, according to NNA. 
     
        “The planes fired a number of air-to-ground missiles, which caused loud explosions, and thick clouds of smoke rose over most of the towns in the Nabatieh and Iqlim al-Tuffah regions,” it said. 
     
 
            The strikes also caused forest fires, according to NNA, which civil defense teams were working to extinguish. The Israel Defense Forces has not issued any statement on strikes in Lebanon Saturday.
     
Rocket barrages from Lebanon into Israel: Fires also broke out in northern Israel after Hezbollah claimed to have fired multiple barrages into the country on Saturday, including targeting the Israeli military’s Beit Hillel barracks with Katyusha rockets. 
     
            The IDF said that approximately 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel on Saturday, with the Israeli Fire and Rescue Authority confirming “a number” of fires in the Safed area and Beit Hillel in northern Israel.
     
            A fire broke out in a house in Kadita in the central Galilee, according to the Northern District Fire and Rescue, which added that three teams were working to control the fire and search for trapped people. Several teams were also trying to extinguish fires in the Biriya Forest. 
     
            There are no reports of casualties, but some property damage has been recorded.
     
Correction: This post has been updated with the location of Beit Hillel.
 
            Lebanon’s health ministry has updated the death toll from Israel’s strike on southern Beirut to 37. 
     
            Previously, 31 people had been reported killed in the strike on Friday, which also killed senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil. Three children and seven women have also been reported dead, and 68 wounded, according to the ministry. 
     
            The ministry added that debris removal efforts are still ongoing. 
     
            The death toll has continued to rise after Israel launched a deadly strike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut Friday. The attack, which Israel says targeted Hezbollah militants, flattened a multistory residential building in a Hezbollah stronghold.
     
            Elsewhere, as tensions in the Middle East continue to rise amid the war in Gaza, an Israeli strike on a school compound in the enclave has killed at least 22 — most of them women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. 
     
Here’s what you need to know about the Beirut strike: 
 
Here’s the Israel-Gaza war latest: 
 
            Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi said Saturday that the recent attacks in the country have compelled the government to closely monitor the movement of foreigners and hotel activities. 
     
            The government will “intensify our efforts, especially intelligence and security efforts on the ground,” Mawlawi said. 
     
        “In recent days, weeks, and months, a large number of martyrs and innocent Lebanese civilians, including children and women, have fallen due to security operations and targeted attacks by the Israeli enemy,” the minister told reporters.“We will closely monitor the movement of foreigners, hotel activities, and closely monitor Syrian and Palestinian camps. We will also pay greater attention to anything that might lead to internal security instability,” he added.
     
 
            The death toll from an Israeli strike on a school compound Saturday has risen 22, according to the Gaza Health Ministry – most of them women and children.
     
            Separately the Government Media Office in Gaza reported that 20 of those killed were women and children: 13 children, six women, and a 3-month-old infant. Thirty people were injured, the GMO added, including 9 children who had needed amputations and others with severe burns.
     
            The Israeli military had said earlier Saturday that the compound was being used as a Hamas command center and precautions had been taken to avoid civilian casualties. 
     
            CNN is unable to verify whether Hamas operatives were present at the compound. The IDF has frequently accused Hamas of using schools and hospitals from which to direct operations. 
     
            A CNN stringer filming the aftermath said that Civil Defense workers said that at least 20 people were killed. Video from the scene showed multiple casualties as rescue workers scrambled through debris. 
     
        A woman who had been staying at the school told CNN: “There was no warning. We were sitting in the schools, and suddenly missiles started raining down on us. There was no warning. Where is the conscience?”The woman, who did not give her name, added: “My message is that this war and the bloodshed should make you wake up. All of you are numb and don’t feel anything… No schools, no hospitals, no food, no water. Shame on you.”
     
 
Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.
 
            The Israeli military on Saturday said it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, continuing its string of attacks this week against the militant group. 
     
            Few other details were available on the fresh strikes but the military is expected to give further details shortly. 
     
Wave of attacks: The strikes come a day after at least 16 operatives of the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, including high level commanders, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut. A total of 31 people were killed in that strike, Lebanon’s health ministry said. 
     
            The first major attack against Hezbollah this week came Tuesday afternoon when pagers belonging to the militant groups’ members exploded near-simultaneously. The pagers had been used by Hezbollah to communicate after the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, encouraged members to switch to low-tech devices to prevent more of them from being assassinated.
     
            Almost exactly 24 hours later, at least 37 people were killed when Lebanon was rocked by a second wave of explosions, after Hezbollah walkie-talkies detonated in Beirut and the south of the country.
     
            The Gaza Civil Defense Directorate says at least 17 people were killed, including women and children, in an Israeli missile strike Saturday in central Gaza. 
     
            The dead included eight children, and more than 30 people had been wounded, according to Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal, who added that people were still missing. 
     
            Basal said there was an Israeli missile strike on Al-Zaytoun School “which shelters thousands of displaced people from Al-Zaytoun neighborhood, southeast of Gaza City.” 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said that aircraft carried out a strike Saturday on a school compound in central Gaza being used by Hamas as a command center. 
     
            The military said its aircraft conducted a “precise strike on terrorists” who were operating inside a Hamas command and control center, and that numerous steps were taken to mitigate the harming of civilians.
     
            At least 31 people have been killed in an Israeli missile strike on a multistory building in south Beirut on Friday targeting Hezbollah, the Lebanese health ministry says. Among the dead is a Hezbollah commander, Ibrahim Aqil, a fresh blow to the militant group which had also lost members in the attacks on wireless devices earlier in the week.
     
Get caught up:
 
            The sisters of Eden Yerushalmi, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 and held hostage in Israel for eleven months, told CNN they have been living “a nightmare” since her body was recovered by the Israeli military late last month. 
     
            Yerushalmi was killed by Hamas and her body was among six recovered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late last month. 
 
            Her sisters Shani and May told CNN’s Anderson Cooper they had received proof that she was alive on three occasions, including just three weeks before her death. 
     
            “It’s very difficult for us. We feel like we’re in a nightmare,” said Shani Yerushalmi. 
     
            Yerushalmi’s family learned details of her captivity from the IDF after her body was returned to Israel.
     
        “They barely could stand fully … they couldn’t sleep next to each other, only in a line. There were no windows, no air, no light. Barely food, and if they needed to go to the bathroom, they were forced to do it in a bucket,” Shani said of conditions in the tunnel. 
     
 
            The IDF said the group’s bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The IDF told the family her sister was “shot in the head from very close range,” and had marks on her hands from defending herself. 
     
            Israel on Friday formally challenged the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) jurisdiction and its prosecutor’s requests for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
     
            Israel is arguing that the court does not have jurisdiction in the case of the Israel-Hamas war, spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry Oren Marmorstein said Friday.
     
            It is also challenging the prosecutor’s request for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant, calling it a “wrongful breach of the Court’s Statute and the principle of complementarity” and arguing that the court failed to provide Israel “with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the Prosecutor, before proceeding.”
     
            “No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the prosecutor,” wrote Mamorstein in a statement on X. 
     
            In May, the ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he was seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.
     
            The number of people killed in the Israeli missile strike on a multistory building in south Beirut has risen to 31, the Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad says. 
     
            Abiad said at a news conference Saturday that those killed included three children and seven women.
     
            Three Syrian citizens had been killed, he said, and 68 people had been wounded. 
     
            It comes after Hezbollah confirmed at least 16 of its operatives, including high level commanders, were killed in Friday’s airstrike.
     
            Rescue teams were still clearing the rubble Saturday, Abiad said, and searching for missing people. They had retrieved body parts that are unidentifiable.
     
            The minister also updated the death toll from the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies which targeted Hezbollah members earlier this week to 39; 12 on Tuesday and 27 on Wednesday.
     
            Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The group’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war has been palpable — Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in skirmishes since the war began, putting the entire region on a knife’s edge with fears it could spark a wider regional conflict.
     
            This is the latest in a decades-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Here’s what to know:
     
Israeli invasion: Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory when it invaded Lebanon in 1982. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reportsand an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Beirut refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila. It’s one of the bloodiest events in the region’s recent history. The investigation, known as the Kahan Commission of Inquiry, held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000.
     
The rise of Hezbollah: As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon’s fractious political landscape. The ragtag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, plus some civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
A “supportive front” for Gaza in 2023: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has engaged in increased clashes with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started on October 7, 2023. The alliance said it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding itself as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader.
     
Killing of key leader: After months of tit-for-tat exchanges, tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, with a strike on Beirut in July. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles at targets in Israel in August. Israel denied any important targets were struck, and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. Officials and residents from the northern region have placed increasing pressure on the Israeli government about the need to return. More than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
Latest attack: Hezbollah confirmed that senior commander Ibrahim Aqil was killed on Friday. Israel said Aqil was among senior Hezbollah figures who were killed in an airstrike on a residential building in Beirut. Lebanon was already reeling after thousands of small blasts hit Hezbollah members’ pagers and walkie-talkies during the week, killing dozens and wounding thousands.
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed that Ibrahim Aqil – the commander of the elite Radwan Force – was killed in Israeli’s strike on southern Beirut. 
     
            Last year, to mark the 40th anniversary of Hezbollah’s bombing of the US Embassy in Beirut in 1983, the US State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information on Aqil.
     
            The US has accused Aqil of involvement in the 1983 embassy strike, which killed 63 people, as well as the Hezbollah bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year.
     
Rewards for Justice, a State Department body that offers rewards for information on terrorists, claims Aqil serves on the Jihad Council, Hezbollah’s highest military body.
     
            In the 1980s, he was a member of Islamic Jihad, the militant group that claimed the two 1983 attacks.
     
            At least 16 Hezbollah operatives, including high-level commanders, were killed in Israel’s  airstrike on Beirut on Friday, according to the militant group.
     
            Among the dead were the top commander of the Iran-backed group’s elite Radwan Force, Ibrahim Aqil and a senior commander, Ahmad Mahmoud Wehbe.
     
            The strike hit a multistory residential building in the southern part of the city.
     
            The deadly strike comes after two days of explosions hit wireless devices carried by Hezbollah members and has sharply escalated the conflict between the two sides and raised fears of all-out war.

Our live coverage from the Middle East has concluded for the day. Please scroll through the post below for all the developments on Friday.
 
            Amir Saeed Iravani, the Iranian envoy to the United Nations, said on Friday that Israel crossed a “red line” by targeting the Iranian ambassador in Lebanon.  
     
            Mojtaba Amani, Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, was among those wounded in Beirut following Tuesday’s wave of deadly pager explosions, along with two embassy employees, according to Iranian state media.   
     
            Amani sustained a superficial injury and received medical attention, Iranian state news agency IRNA said, citing the ambassador’s wife. 
     
            Speaking in the United Nations Security Council on Friday, Iravani also accused the United States and its allies, namely the United Kingdom, of creating an “environment of impunity” for Israel. 
     
            Powerful Iran-backed Shia militia groups in Iraq have vowed to avenge Friday’s deadly Israeli strike in Beirut targeting a top Hezbollah commander.  
     
            Iran-backed groups have carried out dozens of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Israel since the Israel-Hamas war started, to which the US has responded with airstrikes. 
     
            These groups are considered the most powerful armed factions in the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias in the country.
     
            Lebanon and Israel’s envoys clashed at the United Nations Security Council on Friday, following a series of Israeli attacks in Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.
     
            Speaking in the council, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib warned that no one in the world would be safe following the detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies in his country, calling the wave of exploding communications devices a “terrorist attack.” 
     
        “If this terrorist attack is not condemned by your council and if you do not name the perpetrator, if you do not deter the perpetrator, condemn it and compel it to stop such aggressions, the credibility of this council of international law and of human rights law are at stake,” he warned.
     
 
            At least 37 people were killed in this week’s attacks targeting communications devices held by Hezbollah members, including some children, and more than 3,000 were injured. 
     
            Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded, criticizing Bou Habib for not mentioning the Iran-backed Hezbollah in his remarks.
     
            In his own address to the council, Danon accused Hezbollah of violating international law. While Israel does not seek a wider regional conflict, it will not allow the group to continue what he called “provocations,” he said.
     
Some context: Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across the Israel-Lebanese border for nearly a year, forcing tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli residents to flee the border areas. 
     
            Danon said if Hezbollah does not retreat from Lebanon’s southern border with Israel, back to the north of the Litani River through diplomatic efforts, Israel would use any means to defend its citizens.
     
            The Israeli envoy referenced UN resolution 1701 – which stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw north of the Litani River, and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area. 
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed that a senior commander, Ibrahim Aqil, was killed on Friday.
     
        Aqil was killed “following a treacherous Israeli assassination operation on 09/20/2024 in the southern suburbs of Beirut,” the Iran-backed group said in a statement.
     
 
Some context: Israel claimed Aqil was among the top operatives killed Friday in an airstrike on a residential building in a southern suburb of Beirut. At least 14 people died and 66 were wounded in the strike, Lebanon’s health ministry had said.
     
            The US has accused Aqil of involvement in the 1983 embassy strike, which killed 63 people, as well as the Hezbollah bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year. Read more here about Aqil.
 
The post was updated with more from the Hezbollah statement.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is shortening a planned trip to the US next week, Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon confirmed on Friday. 
     
            Netanyahu was originally scheduled to arrive Tuesday, the first day of the high-level week when world leaders gather in New York City.  
     
            Danon told journalists at the UN headquarters in New York that the trip would be delayed, and that developments at home may determine Netanyahu’s travel schedule.  
     
        “He will not arrive on Tuesday like he’s scheduled. We need to postpone now, and we will follow what’s happening in Israel,” Danon said. 
     
 
            Danon also raised the possibility that the Israeli leader might not come at all that week, adding, “we will know when he is coming or if he is coming.” 
     
            Earlier on Friday, Netanyahu’s office said that the prime minister’s flight to New York will be delayed by one day. He is due to speak at the UN General Assembly next week. 
     
            Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The group’s main base is on the Israel-Lebanon border, where the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war has been palpable — Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in skirmishes since the war began, putting the entire region on a knife’s edge with fears it could spark a wider regional conflict.
     
Here’s what to know about Hezbollah
 
Origins: The group emerged from the rubble of Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, when Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.
     
            Israel’s operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reports, and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Beirut refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila. It’s one of the bloodiest events in the region’s recent history. The investigation, known as the Kahan Commission of Inquiry, held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by the right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000.
     
            As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon’s fractious political landscape. The ragtag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, plus some civilians.
     
            A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.
     
Support from Iran: The group made no secret about its ideological allegiance to Tehran and received a steady flow of funds from the Islamic Republic. This helped propel Hezbollah to prominence. It became a participant in Lebanon’s civil war, which ended in 1990, and led a fight against Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon, ultimately driving them out in 2000.
     
A terror designation: In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization, largely since Argentina blamed the group for the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, killing 85, also in the capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah denied responsibility for those attacks.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for an urgent phone consultation with some ministers and security officials, an Israeli official confirmed to CNN.
     
            Official meetings are unusual during Shabbat but not unprecedented during wartime. 
     
            Shabbat begins each Friday at sunset and ends at sundown the following day.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant for at least the third time this week, and he “reiterated his concern over the current escalation of exchanges” between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a Pentagon statement.
     
            Austin’s flurry of calls with Gallant come as Israel has ramped up attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon, including an airstrike in Beirut on Friday. 
     
        “The Secretary strongly reemphasized the importance of reaching a diplomatic resolution that enables residents to return safely to their homes on both sides of the border,” according to the readout. 
     
 
Remember: Thousands of Israeli and Lebanese citizens have been forced from their homes since last October as a result of repeated cross-border exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Forces, which flared up after Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.
     
            “The Secretary also urged continued efforts to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would bring home all hostages held by Hamas. Secretary Austin reaffirmed the United States’ unwavering, enduring, and ironclad commitment to Israel’s security,” the readout added.
     
            Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said operations in the “new phase of the war” will continue, after an Israeli airstrike destroyed a residential building in a southern suburb of Beirut on Friday, killing at least 14, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
        “The series of operations in the new phase of the war will continue until we achieve our goal: ensuring the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes,” Gallant said. “We will continue pursuing our enemies in order to defend our citizens – even in the Dahiyeh in Beirut.” 
     
 
            The strike in Dahiyeh, a southern suburb of Beirut, killed a senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil and other elite force operatives, according to Israel’s military. Hezbollah however has not confirmed the deaths. 
     
            Gallant’s remarks echoed his comments earlier this week that warned of a “new era” in Israel’s war effort.
     
            At least 14 people have died in Israel’s airstrike Friday in Beirut, according to the Lebanese health ministry. 
     
        “Rescue teams on the ground expect to find more martyrs who died under the rubble,” the ministry added. 
     
 
            The strike hit a multistorey residential building in the southern part of the city. 
     
            Top Hezbollah military figure Ibrahim Aqil and other senior Hezbollah elite force members were killed, according to the Israeli military.
     
            Hezbollah has not confirmed the deaths.
     
            The walkie-talkies and pagers that exploded earlier this week in Lebanon were tampered with by “foreign entities,” according to a letter from Lebanon’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations.
     
        “It is estimated that these devices were tampered with from foreign entities before being delivered to Lebanon and modified to send electronic signals that led these devices to be exploded,” according to a letter from the mission dated Thursday and obtained by CNN.
     
 
            The letter was presented to UN Security Council members ahead of a Friday afternoon meeting about the attacks. 
     
More context: On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tacitly acknowledged his country’s role in the twin attacks, saying a “new era” in Israel’s war effort is beginning on the northern front. 
     
            The pager explosions came after Israel on Monday voted to add another war objective to its conflict with Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its northern border with Lebanon to their homes.
     
            Iran’s embassy in Lebanon accused Israel of crossing “all boundaries” following a deadly strike in southern Beirut on Friday that destroyed at least one residential building. 
     
        “We condemn in the strongest terms the Israeli madness and arrogance that crossed all limits by targeting residential areas in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which resulted in the martyrdom and injury of dozens, including children and women,” the embassy said in a statement, calling the attack a “terrorist” crime.  
     
 
            The Israeli military said the strike killed senior Hezbollah military figure Ibrahim Aqil along with other top operatives and leaders in the chain of command of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit. Hezbollah has not commented on the Israel claim.
     
            One multi-story residential building collapsed in the Jamous area of Beirut’s southern suburbs following the attack, Lebanon’s Civil Defense said, revising an earlier statement by the group that described two collapsed buildings.
     
CNN’s Sarah El Sirgany contributed reporting to this post.
 
            The Israeli military claimed that it killed Hezbollah military official Ibrahim Aqil in a strike in Lebanon on Friday. Senior operatives in Hezbollah’s operations staff and commanders from Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force were also killed, it said.
     
At least 12 people have died and 66 others have been wounded in the “targeted” strike in southern Beirut. 
     
Here are the key things to know:
 
            Senior operatives in Hezbollah’s operations staff and commanders from Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force were killed in Israel’s strike in southern Beirut, the Israeli military claimed on Friday.
     
            Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that “about 10 commanders” were killed.  
     
            The military claimed earlier that senior Hezbollah military official Ibrahim Aqil was also killed in the strike.
     
Allegations of a raid: The military alleged that Aqil and the commanders were the architects of a plan to raid and occupy communities in Galilee in northern Israel and kill civilians and Israeli soldiers, comparing it to the October 7 attacks carried out by Hamas last year. 
     
            “They were underground underneath a residential building in the heart of the Dahya neighborhood, using civilians as a human shield,” Hagari said at a news conference on Friday. “They were coordinating terror operations against Israeli citizens.” 
     
            In its statement, the military also accused Aqil of promoting or taking part in other attacks against Israel.
     
            There has been no confirmation from Hezbollah of the deaths.
     
            Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations will tell the Security Council the “diplomatic window of opportunity is closing” to condemn and restrain Hezbollah and Iran, the country’s mission to the UN said. 
     
            The Security Council is due to meet later Friday for an emergency discussion on “recent developments in Lebanon.” 
     
            Danny Danon will say that “the Security Council must strongly condemn Iran and Hezbollah; the time has come to move to action — words are not enough.” 
     
            He is set to tell the meeting that for too long UN resolutions have been ignored, citing UN resolution 1701 – which stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw to north of the Litani River, and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area. 
     
            “It is time that Hezbollah and Iran will bear the severe consequences for their actions. Hezbollah must be disarmed and Iran must be held accountable for destabilizing the region,” Danon will say at the meeting, according to Israel’s UN mission. 
     
            The death toll has risen to at least 12 from Israel’s strike on southern Beirut, Lebanon’s health ministry says. 
     
            A further 66 people were injured, including nine people in critical condition.
     
            At least two residential buildings collapsed in the Jamous area of the city’s southern suburbs following an Israeli strike targeting a top Hezbollah commander.
     
            US President Joe Biden didn’t directly respond when asked what Israel’s strikes in Lebanon mean for the peace process in the Middle East, only saying his administration wants to get people back to their homes safely and voicing optimism that a ceasefire and hostage deal could get done. 
     
            The president said the administration wanted to “make sure that both people in northern Israel as well as southern Lebanon are able to go back to their homes and go back safely.”  
     
        “The secretary of state, secretary of defense, our whole team is working — and the intelligence community try to get that done,” Biden said, ahead of a meeting with his Cabinet. “We’re going to keep at it till we get it done.” 
     
 
            Asked if that was realistic, Biden responded, “If I ever said it’s not realistic, we might as well leave.”
     
            “A lot of things lot of things don’t look realistic until we get them done,” he said. “We have to keep at it.”
     
Where things stand: CNN has reported that despite months of feverish work, there has been growing skepticism within the administration about whether a deal can be struck for a ceasefire deal in Gaza before the end of the president’s term in January.
     
            Top officials increasingly question whether either Hamas or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are interested in striking a deal at all, leading to questions about how to proceed. 
     
            Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present the president with an updated ceasefire proposal, a sign of the stalled talks.
     
            The Lebanese government has requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council following the latest Israeli strike in Beirut, accusing Israel of carrying out acts “akin to genocide” on Lebanese soil.
     
            The Lebanese caretaker cabinet said in a statement posted on X that Friday’s “targeting of a populated residential area once again proves that the Israeli enemy has no regard for humanitarian, legal, or moral considerations, but continues what resembles genocide.”
     
        “This new aggression is a matter of conscience for the international community, which remains silent about violations of human rights and justice,” the statement said.
     
 
            Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and his ministers were informed of the strike during a cabinet meeting, at which he said the latest Israeli attacks in Lebanon — including the pager explosions this week — were “a disgraceful and condemned criminal act, akin to genocide and a horrific massacre.”
     
            While urging the international community to act in the face of Israeli military action, Mikati said Lebanon has received calls from international senior officials confirming that Israel “has crossed the red lines.”
     
            Mikati also announced he will travel to New York on Friday to address the United Nations directly, and he will file a bid to “introduce international laws to safeguard civilian technologies from being used for military purposes.”
     
            The Israeli military has claimed it assassinated senior Hezbollah military figure Ibrahim Aqil in Friday’s strike in southern Beirut.
     
            The military said Aqil was part of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force.
     
            A multistory residential building collapsed in the Jamous area of Beirut’s southern suburbs following an Israeli strike targeting a top Hezbollah commander, according to Lebanon’s Civil Defense. 
     
            A previous statement by the group described two collapsed buildings. 
     
            Earlier, it also said search and rescue teams were on their way to search for those under the rubble, and instructed people to evacuate the site of the destruction.
     
            A CNN team on the ground saw part of an empty plot left behind by a destroyed building. 
     
Clarification: This post has been updated with the revised statement from Lebanon’s Civil Defense.
 
            At least nine people have died and 58 others have been injured in a strike on southern Beirut, Lebanon’s health ministry said.
     
            At least eight of the hospitalized are in critical condition, it said. 
     
            The strike flattened a multistory building in a residential neighborhood.
     
            A CNN team at the scene saw a frantic mass effort to rescue people from underneath the rubble.
     
The number of dead and injured has been updated in this post. 
 
            Sources told CNN that senior Hezbollah military figure Ibrahim Aqil was the target of Israel’s strike on southern Beirut that leveled a building, killing at least eight people and injuring dozens of others.
     
            Last year, to mark the 40th anniversary of Hezbollah’s bombing of the US Embassy in Beirut in 1983, the US State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information on Aqil, a key leader of the militant group.
     
            The US has accused Aqil of involvement in the 1983 embassy strike, which killed 63 people, as well as the Hezbollah bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year.
     
Rewards for Justice, a State Department body that offers rewards for information on terrorists, claims Aqil serves on the Jihad Council, Hezbollah’s highest military body.
     
            In the 1980s, he was a member of Islamic Jihad, the militant group that claimed the two 1983 attacks.
     
            Where just over an hour ago there was a multistory building, now there is destruction.
     
            As ambulances and fire trucks rushed to the scene, a CNN team in Beirut saw one car fleeing with suitcases strapped onto it. After days of exploding devices and, now, airstrikes, no one knows what might happen next.
     
            Police have cordoned off the area and just told the CNN team to leave as a frantic rescue effort played out.
     
            Two severely wounded people have been carried to one of 10 nearby ambulances, and a corpse in a body bag was rushed away on a quad bike.
     
            Witnesses described nearby buildings shaking nearly half an hour after the strike.
     
            A White House spokesperson was “not aware” of any advance notice from Israel to the US ahead of Friday’s strike in southern Beirut targeting a senior Hezbollah official.  
     
            “I am certainly not aware of any brief notification of those strikes,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters during a call Friday, adding the lack of notice was “not atypical.” 
     
            He said he would “let the IDF speak to their operations.”  
     
            Ibrahim Aqil, a senior Hezbollah military figure, was the target of Israel’s airstrike in southern Beirut on Friday, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            Aqil is the head of Hezbollah special operations and one of the most senior military commanders in the organization, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.
     
This post has been updated with more information about Aqil. 
 
            At least three people were killed and 17 others injured in the Israeli strike on southern Beirut, Lebanon’s health ministry said. 
     
            Lebanese media, including the official National News Agency, reported several casualties from the attack, which reportedly targeted a senior Hezbollah figure.
     
            Ambulances are transporting the victims, both the dead and the injured, from the area, including a large number of children and women, NNA reported.
     
            The building is located in a densely populated area, which is also a Hezbollah stronghold.
     
            The target of Israel’s strike in southern Beirut on Friday was a senior Hezbollah official, according to a Lebanese security source and CNN’s Israeli affiliate Kan.
     
            Israeli media and Axios report that the target was Ibrahim Aqil, a senior Hezbollah military figure.
     
            The US government has offered a $7 million bounty for Aqil, whom it accused of playing a role in the 1983 Beirut bombing.
     
            A senior Hezbollah official was targeted in the Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut, a Lebanese security official told CNN.
     
            We’ll bring you more as we get it.
     
            Israeli strikes on the Lebanese capital of Beirut are rare. 
     
            Friday’s is the third in nearly a year of cross-border strikes with militant group Hezbollah since the conflict began last October.
     
            In January, an Israeli airstrike killed Saleh Al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas’ military wing, who had been living in Beirut.
     
            In July, a second Israeli strike on Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr.
     
            Video and images from the scene show extensive destruction on a street of high-rise apartment buildings in Beirut following an Israeli strike.
     
            A number of vehicles were destroyed and thick smoke hung in the air. 
     
            One video, filmed on one of the streets in the southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, shows what appears to be the ground floor of a building destroyed, with several demolished cars and debris scattered around. 
     
            Many residents gathered in an attempt to clear the rubble. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces reported Friday it carried out what it called a “targeted” strike in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. 
     
            There are no details about the target or casualties. 
     
            “At this moment, there are no changes in the Home Front Command defensive guidelines. We will update regarding any changes,” the IDF said, referring to security precautions in force in Israel itself. 
     
            Some 3,000 people were treated in Lebanon for injuries sustained in the immediate aftermath of the pager and walkie-talkie explosions this week, the country’s health minister said Friday. 
     
            Firass Abiad told reporters that doctors worked non-stop for 48 hours, with some patients being transferred for treatment outside Lebanon. 
     
        “It is clear that the nature of the injuries requires not only specialized emergency care but also multiple surgeries and rehabilitation. It requires the involvement of several specialties within the healthcare sector,” Abiad said. 
     
 
            Some patients were taken to Syria, he added, “particularly in the Bekaa region, it was easier for them to go to Damascus due to the chaos that occurred.” 
     
            Other patients went to Iran but “98% of the patients were treated in Lebanon by our Lebanese doctors and specialists,” the minister said. 
     
            Youssef Bakhash, president of the Medical Association, told the news conference that “many of the injuries to hands would need at least one year to fully recover.” 
     
             “Today, we confirm that all the injured have received the necessary initial treatment, whether it was for facial and eye injuries, hand and finger injuries, or abdominal injuries.” 
     
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Friday that his country did not want war but was entitled to live in security and tranquility. 
     
            Herzog posted on X that: “We did not want this war. We do not want war – not today, not ever. But we are entitled to the most basic rights of any nation to live like any other people, in peace, security, and tranquility, and to bring our sons and daughters back home – the hostages back to their families, and the displaced citizens from the north and south to their homes, schools, and businesses.” 
     
            He said Israeli air force strikes in southern Lebanon overnight had been “precise and impressive” and added that “we reaffirm our resolve to overcome in the face of terror.” 
     
            Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) urged residents of several towns in the north of the country to take additional security precautions as fears grow of an intensification of cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah. 
     
            In a Friday statement, the IDF said residents of the town of Safed and other areas were requested to limit movement in the area, avoid gatherings and stay near protected spaces. 
     
            Multiple people were killed across Gaza, officials said Friday, after they reported several airstrikes on parts of Gaza City and northern Gaza over the past 24 hours. 
     
            Six people were killed in an airstrike on a residence near the Municipal Park in Gaza City, Gaza Civil Defense said, and seven people, including two women, were killed in a strike on a house in the Al-Daraj area, in central Gaza City, just before midnight local time on Thursday. 
     
            Hospital authorities provided CNN with the identities of eight people killed in an airstrike on a house in Nuseirat refugee camp early Friday. The list of those killed included three children. 
     
            CNN saw the bodies being brought into Al Awda hospital and is reaching out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the strike. One person was also killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip. 
     
        While attention has shifted to Israeli operations across the border with Lebanon, military operations have continued in Gaza. 
     
 
            In Bureij in central Gaza, CNN filmed rescue operations Thursday – two days after several buildings there were struck. 
     
            More than 50 people were reported missing or trapped under the rubble of a four-story building, according to Civil Defense. CNN has approached the IDF for comment on the Bureij strikes. 
     
            About 130 rockets have been fired into northern Israel from Lebanon on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. 
     
            Merom HaGalil Regional Council said sirens had been activated in a number of locations, but no casualties had been reported and there were no impacts reported within settlements. 
     
            Ten firefighting teams were sent to locations near the town of Safed and Kibbutz Ortal in the Golan Heights to tackle wildfires that broke out following rocket fire from Lebanon. 
     
        Hezbollah claimed its fighters had “bombarded the main air defense base of the [Israeli] Northern Command with a barrage of Katyusha rockets” on Friday, as well as the air and missile defense headquarters at the Kilaa barracks. 
     
 
            Meanwhile, Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) said Israel launched more airstrikes Friday. Israeli aircraft targeted the town of Yaroun in the Bint Jbeil district around noon local time. 
     
        It added that “the skies over the villages of the western and central sectors witnessed heavy surveillance and drone activity by hostile aircraft.” 
     
 
            NNA also reported that the Zibqin Valley in the western sector – some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the border with Israel – was subjected to artillery fire. 
     
            It comes after Israel launched audacious, coordinated attacks targeting Hezbollah members with explosives hidden inside pagers and walkie-talkies, events that have brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider conflict nearly a year after Palestinian militant group Hamas’ October 7 assault on Israel that resulted in the war in Gaza.
     
            Israel’s audacious, coordinated attacks, which targeted Hezbollah members with explosives hidden inside pagers and walkie-talkies, have once again brought the Middle East to the brink of a wider conflict nearly a year after Palestinian militant group Hamas’ October 7 assault on Israel that resulted in the war in Gaza.
     
            Focus is now on what Hezbollah and Israel’s next moves will be, with the United Nations Security Council due to hold an emergency meeting Friday to discuss the situation.
     
            Uncertainty remains over whether Israel’s attacks are a precursor to a ground invasion across its northern border into Lebanon and to what extent Iran-backed Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the region, is capable of responding even as its leader vowed that a “reckoning will come.”
     
Here’s what we know:
 
What’s the fallout?
 
            At least 37 people were killed in the explosions, including children, and nearly 3,000 wounded. Hezbollah said at least 38 of its members had been killed since Tuesday.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned the twin attacks, calling them “massacres” that “crossed all the red lines” because the devices exploded in public areas, with civilians among those harmed.
     
What’s Israel’s plan?
 
            Israel has signaled its readiness for war with Hezbollah. The Israeli defense minister’s warning that a “new era” of war was beginning was followed by the military confirming its top commander had “completed approval of plans for the northern arena” along the Lebanon border.
     
            The refocus north comes after Israel made it a new war objective to return displaced residents to their homes near the northern border after being evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks.
     
How could Hezbollah respond?
 
            Hezbollah’s leader hinted at retaliation for the twin attacks, but it’s unclear what capacity the group might have if many of its members are wounded and key communication methods are no longer reliable.
     
            Despite appearing weakened, Hezbollah is still believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world, with an increasingly sophisticated arsenal that has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel.
     
            There are, however, signs the already secretive group may have been driven deeper underground. 
     
Read the full story.
 
            The Israeli military is investigating soldiers for throwing bodies from a rooftop in the northern occupied West Bank on Thursday.
     
            The incident comes amid an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) incursion in the area that left seven dead, according to the Palestinian government, and has seen clashes and intense gunfire with militants. 
     
            The incident was filmed from several angles by residents of Qabatya, near Jenin, and witnessed by an Associated Press reporter.  
     
            The longest video shows three Israeli soldiers standing on a rooftop. They can be seen pushing a body over the edge of the building. The feet of the body get stuck in what appears to be electrical or telephone cables, and it dangles over the edge, headfirst. One of the soldiers then reaches over to dislodge the person’s feet, and the body tumbles to the ground. 
     
            Approaching a second body on the roof, a soldier picks up the person’s hands and another picks up the feet. They swing the body back and forth, then toss it over the side. Finally, a soldier uses his feet to kick a third body over the side of the building. 
     
        “This is a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values ​​and the expectations from IDF soldiers,” the military said in a statement to CNN. “The incident is under review.” 
     
 
            Under international law,militaries are required to treat the bodies of enemy soldiers with respect, prevent them from being mutilated, and return them to the deceased’s family. The Israeli military often confiscates the bodies of militants killed in battle. 
     
Read the full story.
 
            Israel and Hezbollah — a powerful Iran-backed paramilitary group in Lebanon — have been in conflict for decades, but the two have ramped up cross-border attacks on each other since the war in Gaza began.
     
            This week’s deadly attacks in Lebanon, in which explosives were planted in devices carried by Hezbollah fighters, have drawn sharper focus to the long-simmering conflict.
     
            Israel’s defense minister says a “new era” of war is beginning, and “the center of gravity is moving north,” referencing the country’s border with Lebanon. Hezbollah’s leader says the unprecedented attacks “crossed all the red lines.”
 
How we got here:
 
A “supportive front” for Gaza: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led alliance of militant groups spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has engaged in increased clashes with Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas started.
     
            The alliance said they will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader.
     
Killing of key leader: After months of tit-for-tat exchanges, tensions escalated when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander with a strike on Beirut, Lebanon, in July.
     
            Israel held the commander, Fu’ad Shukr, responsible for a deadly attack on the Israeli-occupied town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, which Hezbollah has denied responsibility for.
     
            In retaliation, Hezbollah launched hundreds of drones and missiles at targets in Israel in August. Israel denied any important targets were struck, and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon.
     
            On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. Officials and residents from the northern region have placed increasing pressure on the Israeli government about the need to return.
     
            More than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
Hezbollah’s arsenal: Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Though no match for Israel’s military might, the group’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage.
     
            But Hezbollah has been backed into a corner by Israel’s latest attacks, with its credibility as the most well-equipped, well-trained and highly disciplined of Iran’s proxies now at risk.
     
            Israel’s attacks on Hezbollah’s operatives and commanders this week are a signal that its war is moving north, according to Steven Cook, senior fellow for Middle East and Africa Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
     
        “It’s clear that the Israeli defense minister has made the case that this is a new chapter in Israel’s ongoing fighting with Hamas and now turning its attention to Hezbollah,” Cook told CNN’s Michael Holmes.
     
 
            From Israel’s perspective, Hezbollah has been firing on Israeli civilians as cross-border skirmishes ramped up over the past year, forcing them to evacuate from their homes. 
     
        “There’s a sense here that the war in Gaza is wrapping up, that Hamas has been damaged to the extent that it cannot threaten Israeli security like it did a year ago, and that it is now time to turn attention to returning Israeli residents to their northern communities.”
     
 
            At least 37 people were killed in the pager and walkie-talkie explosions this week, including children, and nearly 3,000 wounded. Hezbollah said at least 38 of its members had been killed since Tuesday.
     
            Israel perceives the attack as “a precise operation against their enemies” and has been “unapologetic” in the face of massive criticism that their actions could violate the rules of war, Cook said.
     
            Israel has made the return of displaced residents to the north of the country near its border with Lebanon an official war goal, which has been met with support by displaced Israelis who were evacuated due to the risk of Hezbollah attacks.
     
        “We welcome the change in the attitude of the Israeli government and the (Israel Defense Forces), which in recent days has gone from defense to attack in the north,” said Raphael Slab, who is a member of a group called “Fighting for the North.”
     
 
            Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said this week that a “new era” of war was beginning and that “the center of gravity is moving north,” referencing the country’s border with Lebanon. 
     
Some context: Officials and residents from Israel’s northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes and piled pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. 
     
            More than 62,000 people from the north of the country have been internally displaced since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah ramped up after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, according to Israeli government data shared with CNN last month. 
     
            Across the border in Lebanon, more than 94,000 have been displaced, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.
     
            As Israel’s military turns its focus north to the border with Lebanon, some of its residents fear how the change in strategy will impact its war against Hamas and its effort to free the hostages in Gaza.
     
            Families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have held regular protests across the country, piling pressure on the government to secure their release.
     
            A group that represents the relatives of some hostages protested near the Knesset in Jerusalem on Thursday evening, asking to support the families of abductees.
     
            Tikva (Hope) Forum — a smaller, right-wing group not associated with the larger Hostages Families group — said they “want our abductees home and quickly, only crushing Hamas will bring them back.” 
     
            The families from the Tikva Forum are publicly against a ceasefire deal.
     
            Riki Baruch, sister-in-law of Israeli hostage Uriel Baruch, said she appealed to the government to “use all levers of pressure on Hamas, including stopping the humanitarian aid.”
     
            The deadly explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies across Lebanon this week revealed an unprecedented infiltration of militant group Hezbollah’s critical command and control networks. 
     
            The explosions killed at least 37 people, including children, and wounded more than 3,000 others.
     
            Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel, but questions remain on how the compromised Iran-backed paramilitary group will respond.
     
            Israel’s defense minister has said a “new era” of its war is beginning and “the center of gravity is moving north,” referencing the country’s border with Lebanon, tacitly acknowledging the military’s role in the device attacks.
     
            This week’s stealth attacks risk pushing the embattled region to the brink of wider conflict.
     
Here’s what to know: 
 
            The Israeli military continued to strike Hezbollah sites on Thursday, saying it hit approximately 100 rocket launchers.
     
            In addition to the launchers, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it struck “additional terrorist infrastructure sites, consisting of approximately 1000 barrels that were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory.”
     
            Each rocket launcher consists of a multi-barreled weapon that can fire unguided rockets.
     
            According to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency, Israel carried out at least 52 strikes in the south of Lebanon between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. local time.
     
            The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group earlier on Thursday said it launched at least 17 attacks on military sites in northern Israel.     
     
            Israel’s military has released instructions for the communities in several areas in northern Israel, instructing civilians to minimize movements in the areas to avoid gatherings and to stay close to shelters.  
     
Former President Donald Trump called the upcoming US election “the most important” in Israel’s history, saying that the Jewish state would be “eradicated,” “wiped off the face of the earth,” and “cease to exist” if Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidency.
     
            Speaking at an antisemitism event in the US, Trump appeared preoccupied with what he described as ingratitude from Jewish voters, whom he said should be supporting him in greater proportions because of his record on Israel.
     
            “You have to defeat Kamala Harris more than any other people on earth,” Trump said, addressing the Jewish voters in the audience.
     
            “And I’ve never said this before: More than any people on earth, Israel has to defeat her.”
     
He then promised to “make Israel great again.”
 
            Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and a former aide to Democratic officials in New York, accused Trump of using “a speech about antisemitism as an opportunity to embrace antisemitic tropes and attack the American Jewish community.”
     
            “Treating Jews and Israel as political footballs makes Jews, Israel and all of us less safe,” Spitalnick added.

            A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has presented to the Biden administration a new proposed ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            The proposal from Gal Hirsch, a close Netanyahu ally who serves as Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, would see a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, the release in one stage of all hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the safe passage for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to be exiled out of Gaza, according to Kan 11, an Israeli national broadcaster and CNN affiliate.
     
            Reactions to the proposal have widely been that it will be a non-starter for Hamas, which has not commented on it.
     
            It is unclear whether the proposal addresses the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza after a ceasefire and hostage deal – a key sticking point in stalled negotiations. And the idea that Sinwar would leave Gaza is seen as unlikely by American officials.
     
            A separate Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said the proposal was not being discussed among the Israeli negotiating team as a basis for new negotiations with Hamas, which have been at a standstill for weeks now.
     
            The Hostages Families Forum initially praised the outline, but later on Thursday called it a “cynical and cheap manipulation.”

            Hezbollah is on the back foot. The first sign was the absence of a public gathering – typically of high-level party officials and supporters – to watch the militant group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, deliver a televised speech on Thursday.
     
            The second sign was that Nasrallah’s address – his first since two waves of attacks detonated thousands of Hezbollah wireless devices earlier this week – was very possibly pre-recorded.
     
            The leader of the powerful militant group has not delivered a speech in person since the start of Lebanon’s last all-out war with Israel in 2006. But he will often make a point of proving that his broadcasts are live.  
     
            Thursday’s speech was billed as live, but about 20 minutes in, Israel dropped flares over the Lebanese capital and sent windows shaking with a fresh wave of sonic booms. The roar reverberated throughout the city, but the Beirut-based militant leader neither flinched nor referenced the incident.
     
            Israel’s fighter jets seemed intent on underscoring the gains of the attacks on Hezbollah’s wireless devices: the group had been driven deeper underground.
     
        “Without a doubt, we have suffered a major blow,” Nasrallah said.“(It is) unprecedented in the history of the resistance in Lebanon at least, unprecedented in the history of Lebanon, and it may be unprecedented in the history of the conflict with the Israeli enemy across the entire region.”
     
 
            Nasrallah vowed a “reckoning” but was scant on the details. The attack “will be met with a reckoning and fair punishment in ways that they expect and don’t expect,” he said.

Former President Donald Trump called the upcoming US election “the most important” in Israel’s history, saying that the Jewish state would be “eradicated,” “wiped off the face of the earth,” and “cease to exist” if Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidency. 
     
            Speaking at an antisemitism event in the US, Trump appeared preoccupied with what he described as ingratitude from Jewish voters, whom he said should be supporting him in greater proportions because of his record on Israel.
     
        “You have to defeat Kamala Harris more than any other people on earth,” Trump said, addressing the Jewish voters in the audience. “And I’ve never said this before: More than any people on earth, Israel has to defeat her.”
     
 
        He then promised to “make Israel great again.”
     
 
            Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and a former aide to Democratic officials in New York, accused Trump of using “a speech about antisemitism as an opportunity to embrace antisemitic tropes and attack the American Jewish community.”
     
        “Treating Jews and Israel as political footballs makes Jews, Israel and all of us less safe,” Spitalnick added.

            The Israeli military continued to strike Hezbollah sites on Thursday, saying it hit approximately 100 rocket launchers.
     
            In addition to the launchers, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it struck “additional terrorist infrastructure sites, consisting of approximately 1000 barrels that were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory.”
     
            Each rocket launcher consists of a multi-barreled weapon that can fire unguided rockets.
     
            According to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency, Israel carried out at least 52 strikes in the south of Lebanon between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. local time.
     
            The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group earlier on Thursday said it launched at least 17 attacks on military sites in northern Israel.     
     
            Israel’s military has released instructions for the communities in several areas in northern Israel, instructing civilians to minimize movements in the areas to avoid gatherings and to stay close to shelters.  
     
            Hezbollah is on the backfoot. The first sign of that was the absence of a public gathering – typically consisting of high-level party officials and supporters – to watch the militant group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah deliver a televised speech on Thursday.
     
            The second sign was that Nasrallah’s address – his first since two waves of attacks detonated thousands of Hezbollah wireless devices earlier this week – was very possibly pre-recorded.
     
            The leader of the powerful militant group has not delivered a speech in person since the start of Lebanon’s last all-out war with Israel in 2006. But he will often make a point of proving that his broadcasts are being carried by a live transmission. In his speech last month, for example, Nasrallah referenced two sonic booms caused by Israeli jets that had broken the sound barrier over Beirut. These happened in the seconds leading up to the start of his address.
     
        Thursday’s speech was billed as a live transmission, but audiences were given reason to doubt around 20 minutes in, when Israel dropped flares over the Lebanese capital and sent windows shaking with a fresh wave of sonic booms. The roar reverberated throughout the city yet the Beirut-based militant leader neither flinched nor referenced the incident during his speech.

            The father of an American hostage still being held in Gaza by Hamas criticized the deadly attacks in Lebanon that caused pagers and walkie-talkies to explode killing dozens, saying that “this pager, Mission Impossible action, it’s like treating agony with more agony.”
     
            Adi Alexander, whose son Edan Alexander is being held, said in an interview on “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” that “this vicious cycle of violence needs to stop.”
     
            Israel has not officially taken credit for the attacks, but CNN has reported that Tuesday’s operation was a joint effort between the IDF and Mossad.
     
            Alexander sat down with Tapper along with other family members of Americans being held by the terror group on Wednesday as the 1-year anniversary of Hamas’s brutal October 7 attack approaches. As it stands the prospects of a deal being agreed that would free the hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza seem remote.
     
            Instead, the conflict appears to be spreading. On Thursday, Israel launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and on Wednesday Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated a “new era” of war is beginning.
     
        On the ceasefire negotiations, Alexander called for President Joe Biden to “have a tight conversation” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him to “stop moving the goalposts and stop undercutting your own negotiating team.”“This conversation needs to happen as soon as possible,” he added.

            At least two soldiers have been killed in combat in northern Israel, the Israeli military said on Thursday without elaborating on the circumstances of their deaths.
     
            A third soldier was severely injured and taken to a hospital for treatment, it also said.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah were engaged in cross-border strikes on Thursday. 
     
            Israel said it conducted strikes against several Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, across Israel’s northern border. Hezbollah meanwhile said it launched at least 17 rocket and drone attacks into northern Israel on Thursday. 
     
            The State Department said that the United States was not involved in the walkie-talkie attacks in Lebanon on Wednesday, but wouldn’t say that the US was not aware of it.
     
        “We were not involved in that operation in any way, shape, or form, and I’ll leave it at that,” spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday when asked if the US knew about it ahead of time. 
     
 
            National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Wednesday also would only say the US was not involved in that attack or the pager attacks a day prior.
     
            CNN reported Wednesday that Israeli officials notified the US that the country was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon on Tuesday but did not give any details about what they were planning, according to three sources familiar with the matter, including in a call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant early Tuesday morning.
     
            On Tuesday, following the explosion of pagers in Lebanon in an attack carried out by Israel, Miller said that “the US was not aware of this incident in advance.”
     
            Miller on Thursday doubled down on that statement, saying it was “absolutely accurate.”
     
            The United States does not want to see “any party escalate this conflict,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said after the Israeli defense minister spoke of a “new phase in the war” and the Israel Defense Forces announced strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
     
            “It continues to be a very dangerous situation,” Miller said, but noted that the risk of escalation has been present since October 7, 2023. 
     
            The US has stressed the need for a diplomatic solution to the situation on Israel’s northern border both publicly and privately with Israeli officials, Miller said, claiming the Israeli government still wants a diplomatic solution.
     
            “You can look at their public statements and judge for yourself where they’re going, but we still do hear them say that they prefer a diplomatic resolution,” he said at a news briefing.
     
            Asked repeatedly if the US is prepared to continue to back Israel if they open another front in the war, Miller said the US is “committed to the defense of Israel against terrorist organizations, that includes Hamas, includes Hezbollah, includes other Iranian proxies.” 
     
        “We will continue to stand by Israel’s right to defend itself, but we don’t want to see any party escalate this conflict, period,” he said.
     
 
            The Israeli military said it struck dozens of Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon on Thursday.
     
            Israel’s Air Force hit 30 launchers and “terrorist infrastructure sites” containing more than 100 launcher barrels. The Israeli aerial attack also hit a weapons storage facility, it said.
     
            The strikes follow Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s vow on Thursday that Israeli military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon will continue.
     
Hezbollah’s response: The Iran-backed group launched at least 17 attacks into northern Israel on Thursday, according to its statements on Telegram. In a series of statements claiming each attack, the group said it struck Israeli military targets with drones and rockets. At least six of those attacks were launched after 12:30 p.m. ET.
     
            This latest escalation comes after Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah earlier in the day hinted at retaliation against Israel for this week’s deadly pager and walkie-talkie explosions targeting Hezbollah members. 
     
This post has been updated with statements from Hezbollah. 
 
            Israel and Hezbollah — a powerful Iran-backed paramilitary group in Lebanon — have been at conflict for decades, but the two have ramped up cross-border attacks on each other since last October when the war in Gaza began.
     
            This week’s events in Lebanon, which saw a pair of deadly attacks using explosives planted in wireless devices carried by Hezbollah fighters, have drawn sharper focus to the long-simmering conflict. 
     
            Israel’s defense minister says a “new era” of war is beginning and “the center of gravity is moving north,” referencing the country’s border with Lebanon. Hezbollah’s leader says the wireless device attacks “crossed all the red lines” and has hinted at possible retaliation.
     
Here’s how we got to this point:
 
A “supportive front” for Gaza: Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the Middle East spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in increased clashes with Israel and its allies over the past 10 months.
     
            The axis has said they will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader.
     
Killing of key leader: After months of tit-for-tat exchanges, tensions rose further when Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander with a strike on Beirut, Lebanon, in late July. 
     
            Israel held the commander, Fu’ad Shukr, responsible for a deadly attack on the Israeli-occupied town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, which Hezbollah has denied responsibility for.
     
            In retaliation, Hezbollah launched more than 300 drones and missiles at targets in Israel on August 25. Israel denied any important targets were struck, and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial.
     
Displaced residents: The increase in cross-border fighting has forced people from their homes in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon.
     
            On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return tens of thousands of Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border. Officials and residents from the northern region have placed increasing pressure on the Israeli government about the need to return.
     
            Meanwhile, more than 100,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
Hezbollah’s arsenal: Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Though no match for Israel’s military might, the group’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage.
     
            With that said, Hezbollah has been backed into a corner by Israel’s latest attacks, with its credibility as the most well-equipped, well-trained and highly disciplined of Iran’s proxies now at risk, CNN’s Ben Wedeman writes.
     
            Security consultations are underway at Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv, according to an Israeli official. 
     
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minster Yoav Gallant and Foreign Minister Israel Katz were at the meetings on Thursday, the official told CNN. 
     
            The consultations come as the Israeli military is striking targets across Israel’s northern border into Lebanon. The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that top commander Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has approved plans “for the northern arena.”  
     
            Gallant warned Wednesday that a “new era” of war was beginning.
     
            Israel is striking targets in Lebanon on Thursday as the country is reeling from deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members this week.
     
            Pagers simultaneously exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonated in a similar fashion on Wednesday.
     
            The leader of the Iran-backed militant group hinted at possible retaliation while Israel said it would continue its attacks — pushing the region to the brink of a wider conflict.
     
Here’s what to know today.
 
The latest death toll: Lebanon’s health ministry has said 37 people were killed in the device attacks and does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Hezbollah said at least 38 of its members have been killed since Tuesday afternoon, but didn’t provide details on the circumstances of the deaths.
     
What Hezbollah’s leader said: Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech on Thursday condemning the two attacks targeting Hezbollah devices.
     
What Israel has been saying and doing: Additional airstrikes on top of the device attacks come after Israel’s defense minister said that a “new era” in Israel’s war effort was beginning. 
     
Global reaction: A group of United Nations experts said in a statement the device attacks in Lebanon “violate the human right to life” and are violations of international law. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for restraint in Lebanon and said any further escalatory actions in the Middle East could make ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas “even more difficult.” Meanwhile, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said Israel “will soon” face “a decisive and crushing response from (the) axis of resistance.”
     
            Israeli military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon will continue, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed on Thursday.
     
            “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price,” he said in a statement while meeting with military commanders.
     
            The Israeli military on Thursday struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, and the Israel Defense Forces said that Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the chief of the general staff, “completed approval of plans for the northern arena.”
     
        “In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” the statement said.
     
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for “restraint … when it comes to Lebanon in particular” and said any further escalatory actions in the Middle East could make ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas “even more difficult.”
     
        “We continue to work to get a ceasefire for Gaza over the finish line, and as we discussed with some of you just a day ago in Egypt, we believe that remains both possible and necessary,” Blinken said at a news conference with French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné in Paris. “But meanwhile, we don’t want to see any escalatory actions by any party that make that even more difficult.”
     
 
            His comments came as the Israel Defense Forces announced strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, following the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah in recent days.
     
            Blinken did not answer a shouted question from CNN about today’s strikes.
     
        Blinken said the US is working toward “a diplomatic resolution” to the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, noting that “there is a real problem that needs to be resolved when it comes to northern Israel and southern Lebanon.”
     
 
            That problem, Blinken said, “is the fact that since October 8, Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel; Israel’s been firing back.”
     
            He said the US wants to see the populations on each side of the border be able to return home, “and that requires a secure environment.”
     
            Israel “will soon” face “a decisive and crushing response from (the) axis of resistance,” Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami told Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, as cited by Iran state-run IRNA news on Thursday. 
     
            Salami’s threat to Israel came in a letter he sent to the head of the Iran-backed Hezbollah on Thursday, when Nasrallah delivered his first public address since two consecutive days of device explosions in Lebanon killed dozens. 
     
            In his letter, Salami said Israel “will gain nothing from the new, extensive” attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday “by blowing up pagers and electronic devices against women, men and children in Lebanon,” according to IRNA.
     
For context: CNN has learned that Israel was behind Tuesday’s attacks, though Israeli officials have not publicly commented on either day’s explosions. But Israel’s defense minister said Wednesday a “new era” of war was beginning, tacitly acknowledging its role in the wireless device attacks, which have pushed the region back to the brink of wider conflict. 
     
            CNN’s Ben Wedeman had just gone live on air when an Israeli jet flew over Beirut, Lebanon, and dropped what appeared to be flares on the city.
     
Take a look at what happened:
 
            A group of United Nations experts released a stern statement after pagers and walkie-talkies exploded this week across Lebanon, saying the attacks “violate the human right to life” and calling them “terrifying” violations of international law. 
     
        “These attacks violate the human right to life, absent any indication that the victims posed an imminent lethal threat to anyone else at the time,” the experts said in a news release. “Such attacks require prompt, independent investigation to establish the truth and enable accountability for the crime of murder,” they said.
     
 
            “We express our deepest solidarity to the victims of these attacks,” they added.
     
            The experts said international humanitarian law may have been breached as it was impossible to know who held the devices at the time they exploded.
     
            “Simultaneous attacks by thousands of devices would inevitably violate humanitarian law, by failing to verify each target, and distinguish between protected civilians and those who could potentially be attacked for taking a direct part in hostilities,” it said.
     
            At least 37 people died in the two attacks across Tuesday and Wednesday, and more than 3,000 others were injured. 
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says the group’s leadership was mostly spared during Tuesday’s attack targeting pagers that killed several members in Lebanon as they were using older devices while “new ones were sent elsewhere.”
     
            “In any case, the goal was to kill as many leaders and officials as possible, to strike at Hezbollah’s structure, and to damage its command and control system,” he added. “This was meant to spread chaos, confusion, weakness, and disarray within Hezbollah and the resistance. However, this did not happen for even a single moment.” 
     
            “From the first moment, the leadership and the administration was active and the front was fully prepared. We were prepared for an offensive from the Israelis at the front,” Nasrallah added. 
     
            At least 12 people were killed and around 2,800 injured in Tuesday’s attack, according to the Lebanese health ministry.  
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel that the Lebanese front will “not stop” until hostilities end in Gaza.
     
            “We say to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and (Israeli Defense Minister Yoav) Gallant … and to the enemy’s government, army, and society: The Lebanese front will not stop until the aggression on Gaza ceases,” he said. 
     
        “We’ve been saying this for 11 months; we might be repeating ourselves, but this statement comes after these two major blows … I say clearly: No matter the sacrifices, consequences, or future possibilities, the resistance in Lebanon will not stop supporting Gaza.” 
     
 
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has called the attacks on the group “unprecedented” but vowed it will not bring them down. 
     
            “There is no doubt that we have suffered a major blow,” he said in his Thursday speech, “both in terms of security and humanity, an unprecedented one in the history of the resistance in Lebanon at least, unprecedented in the history of Lebanon, and it may be unprecedented in the history of the conflict with the Israeli enemy across the entire region, perhaps even unprecedented in the world.” 
     
            “It is the nature of war. One day the enemy will hit us and the next we will hit the enemy,” he added, hinting at possible retaliation.  
     
“Reckoning will come”: Nasrallah added that the “reckoning will come” following the attacks, and said the group was calling them the “Tuesday and Wednesday massacres.” 
     
            He accused Israel of intending to kill thousands of people holding the pagers. 
     
            “Over the course of two days, and in a single minute on Tuesday and in a single minute on Wednesday, the Israeli enemy intended to kill not less than 5,000 people in two minutes and with no consideration for any restraint,” he said. 
     
            He said this would have amounted to “a mass terrorist event, a mass genocide, a massacre.”
     
            He went on to call it a “massive aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security, war crimes, or a declaration of war — you can call it anything, and you would be right to call it what you want. Of course this was the (scenario) the enemy intended to do.” 
     
            Nasrallah added that the outcome was far less bloody than it could have been.  
     
            The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it is striking targets in Lebanon “to degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure.” 
     
In a post on X, the IDF said Hezbollah had “weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them and used civilians as human shields—having turned southern Lebanon into a war zone.”
     
            “The IDF is operating to bring security to northern Israel in order to enable the return of residents to their homes and achieve war goals,” it wrote. 
     
For context: It is not unusual for the Israeli military to strike Hezbollah — the two have engaged in near-daily exchanges since October 8 last year. But it comes as the IDF said its top commander has “completed approval of plans for the northern arena,” and a day after Israel’s defense minister said that a “new era” in Israel’s war effort was beginning. 
     
            CNN’s Ben Wedeman had just gone live on air when an Israeli military jet flew over Beirut and appeared to drop flares over the Lebanese capital. 
     
            “It flew right over the city,” Wedeman said. 
     
            CNN reporters in the country heard a sonic boom as the jet entered Beirut’s airspace.
     
            What appeared to be flares were dropped as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s speech was being broadcast to the country. 
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned the two attacks this week targeting Hezbollah wireless devices, referring to them as “massacres.” 
     
            Nasrallah said Hezbollah will consider the attacks from Tuesday and Wednesday as an addition to the list of the many deadly acts committed by Israel.
     
            He claimed that in the two attacks, “the Israeli enemy aimed to kill at least 5,000 people in just two minutes, without any regard for any regulations.” 
     
            Nasrallah said the attacks “crossed all the red lines,” saying the devices exploded in public areas, harming civilians as well as Hezbollah members.
     
        “Even if they wanted to target Hezbollah men and fighters, they were targeting everyone around them,” he said.
     
 
The translation of Nasrallah’s quote about “red lines” has been updated.
 
            The Israeli military said Thursday its top commander has “completed approval of plans for the northern arena,” as fears grow of an escalation in cross-border tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not elaborate on the statement, only releasing a photo of the commander, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the chief of the general staff, meeting with military colleagues.
     
            The announcement comes one day after Israel’s defense minister said that a “new era” in Israel’s war effort was beginning, after booby-trapped devices belonging to Hezbollah members exploded across two days in Lebanon.
     
            Tacitly acknowledging his country’s role in that operation, Yoav Gallant said the center of gravity of the war was moving north.
     
            “The IDF brings excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad, all the bodies and all the frameworks and the results are very impressive results,” Gallant said during a visit to the Ramat-David Air Force base in northern Israel. 
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has started his first speech since the twin attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday by thanking the Lebanese government, medical and emergency services for their response in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.  
     
            Nasrallah praised the unity demonstrated by the Lebanese people.  
     
            A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has presented a new proposed ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas to US President Joe Biden’s administration, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            The proposal from Gal Hirsch, a close Netanyahu ally who serves as Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, would see a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, the release in one stage of all hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the safe passage for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to be exiled out of Gaza, according to Kan 11, an Israeli national broadcaster and CNN affiliate.
     
            Reactions to the proposal have widely been that it will be a non-starter for Hamas, which has not commented on it.
     
            It is unclear whether the proposal addresses the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza after a ceasefire and hostage deal — a key sticking point in stalled negotiations. And the idea that Sinwar would leave Gaza is seen as unlikely by American officials.
     
            A separate Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said the proposal was not being discussed among the Israeli negotiating team as a basis for new negotiations with Hamas, which have been at a standstill for weeks now.
     
For context: Since last October when the war in Gaza began, following Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, Hezbollah and Israel have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other. 
     
            Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the Middle East spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 10 months.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah will soon be speaking after at least 38 Hezbollah members were killed since Tuesday afternoon.
     
            So far, the Iran-backed militants have not provided details on the specific circumstances of the deaths or whether they were caused by the communication device explosions or occurred on the battlefield.
     
            This is an idea of what the walkie-talkies that exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday may have looked like. 
     
            The devices that blew up were a discontinued model made by the Japanese firm ICOM, according to Lebanon’s communications ministry.
     
            The IC-V82 radios were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, the ministry said.
     
            The company’s website says the IC-V82 has been discontinued, and almost all models in current circulation are counterfeit.
     
            This is an ICOM IC-V82 walkie-talkie:
     
            Over the last 48 hours, Hezbollah’s Telegram channel has also become focused entirely on death announcements.
     
            At least 38 Hezbollah members have been killed since Tuesday afternoon, although the Iran-backed militants did not provide details on the specific circumstances of the deaths or whether they were caused by the communication device explosions or occurred on the battlefield.
     
            Each Telegram announcement includes both the real and alias name of the fighter, along with a profile picture and the phrase “they died on the road to Jerusalem.” 
     
            It remains unclear whether these fighters were killed in the communication device explosions or in Israeli airstrikes.
     
            The Lebanese Army is detonating “suspicious” pagers and wireless devices across the country after Israel launched covert attacks, exploding pagers and walkie-talkies on Tuesday and Wednesday.
     
            In a statement posted to X, the army urged citizens to stay away from the detonation sites.
     
        “Specialized army units are detonating suspicious pagers and communication devices in various areas. Citizens are therefore urged to stay away from the detonation sites, report any suspicious devices or objects, and avoid approaching them.”
     
 
            At least 38 Hezbollah members have been killed since Tuesday afternoon, the group says, the deadliest period for the group since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7.
     
            The Iran-backed militants did not provide details on the specific circumstances of the deaths or whether they were caused by the communication device explosions or occurred on the battlefield.
     
            But given Lebanon’s health ministry has announced five battlefield deaths since Tuesday – unrelated to the wireless device attacks and normally indicating the death of Hezbollah fighters — that points to a total of 33 Hezbollah fighters being killed in the attacks targeting wireless devices.
     
            There has been no official confirmation of the number of Hezbollah fighters killed in the explosions, which hit pagers and walkie-talkies. 
     
            Lebanon’s health ministry has said 37 people were killed in the attacks, and does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 
     
            Health Minister Firass Abiad said Thursday that 25 people were killed and 608 injured in Wednesday’s blasts targeting walkie-talkies, and the ministry has put the death toll from Tuesday’s pager explosions at 12.
     
            Speaking outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center, reconstructive surgeon Ghassan Abu Sitta told CNN that there is a long road to recovery for many of those injured by the exploding wireless devices.
     
            On Tuesday, a joint Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Mossad operation blew up pagers across Lebanon, killing 12 and injuring 2,800 more. Then, on Wednesday, walkie-talkies exploded in the country killing at least 25 and wounding 450, taking the death toll across both attacks to 37, according to the Lebanese health ministry.  
     
            Abu Sitta said people were presenting to the hospital with injuries to their hand, face and eyes. He said between 50 and 60 surgeries have taken place over the last day, and they expect another 50 to 60 to take place tomorrow. 
     
        “The problem is we don’t have enough equipment because of the sheer numbers and more importantly these are injuries that will need between five and 12 surgeries within the next few years in terms of rehabilitation (and) reconstruction,” he said.
     
 
            The surgeon also told CNN that the blasts impacted many family members who happened to be in a car or in the same room as the wireless devices when they exploded.
     
        “There were some families. There was a family in the car where the pager was in the bit between the seats that went off,” he added.
     
 
Correction: This post has been updated to correct the death toll from the attacks in Lebanon across Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
            Backing for Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel has dropped significantly in Gaza during the last six months, a poll of Palestinians in the enclave shows, as conditions deteriorate after almost a year of war.  
     
            In March, 71% of Palestinians in Gaza who responded to the poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research said they believed that Hamas’ decision to launch the October 7 attack was correct. When the poll was conducted this month, that number stood at just 39%. 
     
            The poll, which has been conducted every three months since September last year, surveyed 410 people across Gaza, in 41 locations, a smaller sample size than when the poll was carried out in March.
     
            The researchers also spoke with 790 people in the West Bank. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.5%. 
     
            Conducting a poll during wartime is of course incredibly difficult – as acknowledged by the pollster. The center said the interviews were conducted in areas where there was no on-going daily fighting.
     
            The survey paints a bleak picture of life in Gaza, with just under a third of people saying they have enough food. Of those polled, 57% say that a family member has been killed during the war. And an increasing number of people there – nearly half – believe that neither Hamas nor Israel will emerge victorious in the war.
     
            Support for Hamas as a political party in Gaza also fell, but has remained relatively stable through the war. With almost no viable political rivals, it remains the most popular political actor there: 35% in Gaza said they supported Hamas, down from a high of 42% in December. 
     
            Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Backed by Iran and based in the eastern Mediterranean country of Lebanon, the Shia Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8.
     
            The cross-border hostilities have raised the specter of a regional conflagration and prompted intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel and its allies in the region.
     
            Put simply: Hezbollah are capable of striking all of Israel. While Israel has a vastly superior military to Hezbollah, the group boasts missiles with a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles). These would have to bypass Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system to cause damage.
     
            Israel would also have to contend with Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The group is part of an Iran-led axis of militants spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq. Some of these groups have increased coordination significantly since last October, when Israel launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked the country. This axis is known in Israel as the “ring of fire.”

            Lebanon is reeling after facing deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members – with pagers simultaneously exploding across the country on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion on Wednesday.
     
            At least 32 people, including children, were killed.
     
Israel’s defense minister said a “new era” of war was beginning, tacitly acknowledging its role in the shock attacks. “The center of gravity is moving north,” Yoav Gallant said, referencing the Lebanon border.
     
            How were the attacks carried out, where did the devices come from, and will this plunge the Middle East into a wider conflict?
     
Here’s what we know:
 
How did it happen? Hezbollah bought the pagers that exploded in recent months, a Lebanese security source told CNN. The New York Times reported that Israel planted explosives next to the battery in each pager, as well as a switch for remote detonation, citing US and other officials.
     
            When CNN tried to trace the pagers’ origin, it found a supply chain that stretched from Asia to Europe.
     
Why now? Israel may have believed Hezbollah had discovered the pagers’ capability – making it a “use it or lose it” moment, said an Israeli source familiar with national security.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also have wanted to shore up domestic support. Officials and residents from the northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes after being evacuated due to cross-border attacks.
     
            On Tuesday, Israel made it a war objective to return Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border.
     
Here’s how Hezbollah, Iran and others reacted.
 
            Eight Israelis were hospitalized, health officials said Thursday, following reports of an anti-tank missile attack near the border with Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah said the group had attacked an Israeli military position in an area along the border, “causing a number of casualties and injuries.”
     
            CNN has contacted the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).
     
            Israel’s Army Radio station reported that eight people had been injured after an anti-tank missile struck the Ramim Ridge in the Upper Galilee area.
     
            Two of the wounded were evacuated by helicopter to Rambam Hospital in the coastal city of Haifa and have been transferred to surgery, according to the hospital’s spokesperson. The official said they were injured in an “incident,” without providing further details.
     
        “They are currently defined as medium-severe, in stable condition,” the hospital spokesperson said.
     
 
            Six others were evacuated to Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed, according to the hospital, which added that the injured were in “mild” condition.
     
            Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport has banned pagers and walkie-talkies from being carried onto flights, following two days of attacks on wireless devices across Lebanon. 
     
        Airport authorities requested airlines inform passengers that “it is prohibited to carry any pager or walkie-talkie device on board the aircraft, whether inside a hold bag or a handbag and also through cargo” in a notice issued on Thursday.  
     
 
            Any such devices will be confiscated by airport security if found, the notice warns.  
     
            The Israeli military said it targeted Hezbollah infrastructure sites and a weapons storage facility in airstrikes on southern Lebanon overnight. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah infrastructure in six areas — Chihine, Tayibe, Blida, Meiss El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela — and a weapons storage facility in the area of Khiam. 
     
            In addition, IDF artillery struck “several areas” in southern Lebanon, the military said. 
     
            The extent of the damage is unknown. 
     
            The strikes come after Israel’s defense minister said a “new era” of war was beginning Wednesday, tacitly acknowledging its role in shock twin attacks targeting Hezbollah that have pushed the Middle East back to the brink of wider conflict.
     
            Consecutive days of pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon have left a “distinct psychological impact” on the country’s population, according to Clara Broekaert, research fellow at The Soufan Center.
     
            Walkie-talkie detonations on Wednesday killed at least 20 people and wounded 450 in a fresh attack targeting Hezbollah, a day after pager blasts killed at least 12 people, including children, and injured thousands across the country. 
     
            Some of the devices blew up in public spaces like grocery stores, injuring civilians, Broekaert told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade.
     
        “The fact that it interrupted daily life in such a horrific and unexpected way and on such a broad scale, I do think this will put extra pressure for retaliation. People want to see accountability for what happened,” Broekaert said.
     
 
            Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has previously stated it does not want to escalate tensions to a full-fledged regional war. However, Hezbollah’s leader “will feel pressure to act, to retaliate even if it’s more symbolic” following the spate of explosions, Broekaert.
     
            Hezbollah is expected to conduct internal checks over their operational security and to understand to what extent their networks have been compromised, she added.
     
            People in Lebanon are terrified of everyday communication devices following two days of deadly pager and walkie-talkie blasts, said Nabih Bulos, Middle East bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times.
     
        “Just to give you a sense of the rumors we’ve been hearing, there are all these messages circulating for people telling people to shut off their wi-fi routers or take out batteries from certain devices,” Bulos told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade. “There really is a fear of the normal items you have at home.”
     
 
            Speaking from Beirut, Bulos said there is fear that there may be another attack in Lebanon on Thursday.
     
            Hezbollah has long touted secrecy as a cornerstone of its military strategy, forgoing high-tech devices to avoid infiltration from Israeli and US spyware.
     
            At the start of the year, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called on members and their families in southern Lebanon, where fighting with Israeli forces across the border has raged, to dump their cellphones, believing Israel could track the movement of the Iran-backed terror network through those devices.
     
            But the deliberate evasion of surveillance has proven to be ineffective and exposes “part of a larger continuum of intelligence failures over the last few months,” Bulos said.
     
        “Not to mention, there is now going to be a crippling of his communications network because they’ll have to revamp it completely to try to avoid further penetration,” Bulos said.
     
 
            Israel says its war focus is “moving north,” tacitly acknowledging its role in shock twin attacks on Hezbollah in which pagers and walkie-talkies used exploded across Lebanon on consecutive days.
     
            Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN he fears that the attacks signal a move to an “introduction to war.”
     
            “It’s a scary moment and we are afraid (of) coming to war, because we don’t want a war,” said the foreign minister, who blamed Israel for the attacks.
     
Here’s what else we know:
 
            Iran has said it will respond after its ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was wounded in the exploding pager attack targeting Hezbollah, which killed at least 12 people,including children, and injured thousands across the country.
     
            “Iran will duly follow up on the attack against its ambassador in Lebanon, which resulted in his injury, and reserves its right under international law to take required measures deemed necessary to respond to such a heinous crime and violation,” Iran’s mission to the UN said in a letter on Wednesday.
     
            Iran backs Hezbollah, which is one of the most powerful militia groups in the Middle East and has been involved in daily exchanges of fire with Israel since the October 7 Hamas attacks. 
     
            CNN has learned that Israel, which refused to comment directly on this week’s series of explosions in Lebanon, was behind the attacks.
     
            “The UN Secretary-General and the Security Council must condemn unequivocally Israel’s terrorist action and heinous crime against the head of Iran’s diplomatic mission in Lebanon, as well as violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and attacks and targeting of Lebanese civilians,” the letter said.
     
            The ambassador’s wife said on social media that his treatment “is going well,” according to state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.
     
            Japanese firm ICOM said that the model of its walkie-talkie linked to explosions in Lebanon was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether they were counterfeit or shipped from its company.
     
            “The IC-V82 is a handheld radio that was produced and exported, including to the Middle East, from 2004 to October 2014. It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company,” it said Thursday. 
     
            The company said production of the batteries in the devices was also discontinued and that “a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company.”
     
            Lebanon’s communications ministry has said that the walkie-talkies used in the attack Wednesday, which killed at least 20 people and injured 450 others, were a discontinued model, the IC-V82, made by the Japanese firm.
     
            The IC-V82 radios were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not licensed and were not vetted by the security services, the ministry said.
     
            ICOM said all of its radios are manufactured in Wakayama Prefecture under a strict management system to ensure “no parts other than those specified by our company are used in a product.”
     
            “All of our radios are manufactured at the same factory, and we do not manufacture them overseas,” it said. 
     
            It also said products for overseas markets are sold exclusively through authorized distributors and that it conducts “strict export controls” based on government security trade regulations. 
     
            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Israeli counterpart Wednesday for the third time in 48 hours following consecutive days of pager and walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon attributed to Israel that killed dozens and wounded thousands.
     
            The heightened frequency of the calls underscores the sensitivity of the moment, as US officials push for a diplomatic offramp to an increasingly volatile situation between Israel and Hezbollah. 
     
            Austin told Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the US was committed to “deterring regional adversaries,” as well as “efforts to deescalate tensions across the region,” according to a readout of the call.
     
            Austin spoke to Gallant twice on Tuesday. In the first of those calls, Gallant notified Austin that Israel was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon but gave no details on what the operation would entail. 
     
            The White House reiterated Wednesday that the US was not involved in the series of attacks in Lebanon.
     
            The US learned about the operation’s details from reports of exploding Hezbollah pagers a short time later. 
     
            After declining to comment on Tuesday’s pager explosions, Gallant appeared to reference the attacks during a visit Wednesday to the Ramat-David Air Force base in northern Israel.
     
        “We are at the beginning of a new era in this war and we need to adapt ourselves,” Gallant said.
     
 
            Gallant praised the “excellent achievements” of the Israel Defense Forces, together with the country’s security agency, the Shin Bet, and its intelligence agency, Mossad.
     
            Gallant’s comment is the first time an Israeli official has tacitly acknowledged Israel’s role in the twin attacks.
     
            Israel has severely disrupted Hezbollah’s communications network, possibly paving the way for an imminent military offensive in Lebanon, says CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer. 
     
            This week’s attacks rendered Hezbollah unable to coordinate operations effectively, giving Israel a significant strategic advantage in their conflict, according to the former CIA operative.
     
            Baer noted that recent comments by Israel’s defense minister indicate a shift in focus towards Hezbollah, with Israel “pivoting north” after concentrating efforts on Gaza. He said this escalation could lead to an invasion or a widespread bombardment of Lebanon. 
     
            Baer described Israel’s breach of Hezbollah’s supply and communication network as a “great defeat” for the group. This tactical achievement has crippled Hezbollah’s ability to mobilize forces, coordinate attacks, and manage logistics. 
     
            “The fact that Israel got into their supply network is unprecedented,” Baer remarked, highlighting the disruption of Hezbollah’s use of walkie-talkies as particularly damaging because Hezbollah relies on them to call in fire coordinates, move ammunition, and communicate in real-time. 
     
            This leaves Hezbollah vulnerable if Israel moves forward with its military plans. 
     
            Baer, who has tracked Hezbollah for years, expressed astonishment at the precision and scale of the Israeli operation. 
     
“This is a huge setback for Hezbollah,” he said.
 
 
            Baer said that the operation reflects Israel’s remarkable technical capabilities and emphasized that Hezbollah has long been known for its disciplined and secure communications, making Israel’s breakthrough even more significant. 
     
            He also suggested that the operation serves as a warning to other hostile actors in the region. Israel’s ability to penetrate Hezbollah’s communication network could signal to countries like Syria, Egypt, and Jordan that their systems may be vulnerable to similar infiltration. 
     
            Hezbollah announced the death of 16 members on Wednesday, one of the deadliest days for the group since the Israel-Hamas war started on October 7. 
     
            The Iran-backed militant group did not give details on the circumstances of the deaths, but said most were from towns in the south of Lebanon. 
     
            Among those who died was a 16-year-old boy, it said. 
     
            Hezbollah said in 16 separate short statements that all the men had been killed “on the road to Jerusalem,” a reference to those fighting to support people in Gaza, but did not elaborate.
     
            The announcement came after walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon on Wednesday killed at least 20 people, according to the country’s health ministry. It also came as the Israeli military announced it had struck several Hezbollah “infrastructure sites” in southern Lebanon.
     
            A Taiwanese electronics manufacturer has said that a tiny European company made the pagers linked to the deadly attack targeting Hezbollah members in Lebanon, as a fresh wave of walkie-talkie explosions rocked parts of the country a day later and raised questions over how the devices made it there.
     
            At the non-descript offices of Gold Apollo on the outskirts of the Taiwanese capital on Wednesday, the founder of the company, Hsu Ching-kuang, denied making the pagers bearing its brand name that were used in Tuesday’s assault – later pointing, without evidence, to the Budapest-registered BAC Consulting firm.
     
            “The design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,” Gold Apollo said. Hsu said that his firm had established a relationship with the Hungarian company about three years ago.
     
            The allegations raise further questions as to who manufactured the devices and just how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets.
     
            Hungarian authorities denied Gold Apollo’s suggestion, saying that the Budapest-registered company “is a trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country. 
     
        “The referenced devices have never been in Hungary,” Hungary’s State Secretary for International Communication Zoltan Kovacs said.
     
 
            CNN has attempted to reach BAC at the address listed for its office, located in a residential area of Budapest.
     
            A receptionist working at the building told CNN that BAC Consulting rents a space at the address but has never physically been to the building. A woman living in an upstairs apartment said she hardly sees anyone coming to the building to work.
     
            Plainclothes police arrived on site when CNN was there. Kovacs said that an investigation had been opened and Hungary was “cooperating with all relevant international partner agencies and organizations.”

Our live coverage of the explosions targeting Hezbollah has moved here.
 
            The pagers used to attack members of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah were made by a European distributor for manufacturer Gold Apollo, according to the Taiwanese company’s chairperson. 
     
            Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah, according to the New York Times.
     
            Multiple images from Lebanon shared on social media appear to show damaged Gold Apollo pagers. CNN cannot geolocate the images but has verified they were published on Tuesday, the same day as the explosions. At least one pager shown in the images was a Gold Apollo AR924 model. 
     
            Gold Apollo founder and chairperson Hsu Ching-kuang told reporters on Wednesday that his firm had signed a contract with a European distributor to use the Gold Apollo brand.   
     
            Hsu said the distributor, which he later named as BAC in a company statement, established a relationship with Gold Apollo about three years ago.  
     
            At first, the European company only imported Gold Apollo’s other pager and communication products, he said. Later, the company told Gold Apollo they wanted to make their own pagers and asked for the right to use the Taiwanese company’s brand, he said.   
     
            Hsu said Gold Apollo had encountered at least one anomaly in its dealings with the distributor, citing a wire transfer that took a long time to clear. 
     
            Taiwan has no record of Gold Apollo pagers being shipped to Lebanon or the Middle East, a senior Taiwanese security official told CNN on Wednesday. Gold Apollo shipped about 260,000 pagers from Taiwan, mostly to the United States and Australia, the official told CNN.  
     
This post has been updated with more information.
 
            Hundreds of pagers carried by Hezbollah members in Lebanon blew up nearly simultaneously on Tuesday in an unprecedented attack that surpasses a series of covert assassinations and cyber-attacks in the region over recent years in its scope and execution.
     
            The Iran-backed militant group said the wireless devices began to explode around 3:30 p.m. local time in a targeted Israeli attack on Hezbollah operatives.
     
            CNN learned that Israel was behind the attack, which was a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, and the Israeli military. The Lebanese government condemned the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression.”
     
            Israel’s military, which has engaged in tit-for-tat strikes with Hezbollah since the start of the war with Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza last year, has refused to comment publicly on the explosions.
     
            The pagers that exploded were new and had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, a Lebanese security source told CNN. The source did not provide any information on the exact date the pagers were bought or their model.
     
            Experts say the explosions, unprecedented in their scale and nature, underscore Hezbollah’s vulnerability as its communication network was compromised to deadly effect.
     
How did the pagers explode? The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah. A switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, it added.
     
What is the purpose of the attacks? At least part of the message to Hezbollah is clear: “We can reach you anywhere, anytime, at the day and moment of our choosing and we can do it at the press of a button,” according to CNN’s Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller.
     
Read more on what we know.
 
            Photos that appear to show damaged Gold Apollo pagers have emerged on social media, alongside claims that they were damaged in Lebanon’s wave of pager explosions in on Tuesday.
     
        CNN cannot geolocate the images but has verified that they were published on Tuesday, the same day as the explosions. At least one pager shown in the images is the Gold Apollo AR924 model. 
     
 
            CNN has reached out to the Taiwanese manufacturer for comment.
     
            The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah. 
     
            Most of the pagers were the company’s AP924 model but three other Gold Apollo models were included in the shipment, the Times reported.
     
            CNN previously reported that the pagers had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, according to a Lebanese security source. 
     
            Israel was behind the attack that caused thousands of pagers belonging to Hezbollah members to simultaneously explode in Lebanon on Tuesday, CNN has learned.
     
            The operation, which left thousands injured across Lebanon, was the result of a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, and the Israeli military.
     
            Israel placed explosive material in a batch of Taiwanese-made pagers which were imported into Lebanon and destined for Hezbollah, the New York Times reported, citing American and other officials briefed on the operation.
     
How it happened: The explosives were planted next to the battery in each pager, and a switch embedded to detonate them remotely, according to the New York Times. The devices detonated simultaneously after receiving a message on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least 9 people and injuring more than 2,800 — including at least 170 of whom were in critical condition, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health.
     
            Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel for the attack. Israel has not commented.
     
            Eyewitnesses have described to CNN how people lay injured in the streets of the Lebanese capital following the deadly pager explosions on Tuesday.  
     
            One witness, who spoke to CNN outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center and asked not to be named citing fears for his safety, described going outside in a southern Beirut suburb after reading about the explosions online. 
     
        “We went out to the streets, and we found the suburb as if it was a zombie city,” he said. Injured people were lying scattered on the roads, he said, adding that some of his friends were among the wounded.  
     
 
            Another witness, who also asked not to be named over fears for his safety, said he had been driving to work when he saw Red Cross ambulances and people lying on the ground. 
     
        “We were surprised that there were a lot of people … there was blood on the roads and people were being transported in ambulances to the hospital. But we did not know what was happening,” he said. The second witness said he had gone to a hospital to visit a friend who had been carrying one of the pagers when it exploded. “This device was not only in the hands of people who belong to [Hezbollah], but in the hands of all people. There were people working in the security field who were using that device and they were also hurt,” he added. 
     
 
            Is it a prelude to a wider attack or the totality of the message to Hezbollah? This is the key question for the next 48 hours in the Middle East, as the Lebanese militant group comes to terms with the wholesale disruption and violation of their most sacred communications.
     
            Tuesday’s wave of explosions in Lebanon will likely scar the Party, as they are often known, who pride themselves on secrecy, and the technological omerta their members adhere to. Yet it is their very bid to keep their secrets – using low-tech pagers and not more trackable smartphones – that appears to have led to several deaths and thousands of injuries.
     
            It will have caused a seismic shock with Hezbollah members to now be asking not only if it is safe to contact their colleagues, but if those colleagues are unharmed?
     
            Israel has characteristically not claimed responsibility, but if it was behind the attack as Lebanon and Hezbollah say, then the question is whether this vast and unprecedented assault was intended to presage a wider fight.
     
            It would make strategic sense to dispense a moment of intense chaos like this just before a bigger onslaught on the group militarily.
     
            The timing is telling. Just on Monday, the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a meeting with the US envoy Amos Hochstein that the time for diplomacy with Hezbollah had passed and military might could take center stage. Literally hours later, their enemy’s entire communications infrastructure was hit with an attack that, according to a Lebanese security source, used pagers purchased by Hezbollah in “recent months,” necessitating a long lead time in the operation’s planning.
     
            At the same time, the given wisdom that Israel does not want a war either is eroding.
     
Read more of the analysis.
     
            At least nine people were killed and 2,800 wounded in an attack that targeted pagers held by members of Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah across Lebanon on Tuesday, according to the country’s health minister. Iran’s ambassador to Beirut was one of those injured, according to Iranian state media.
     
            Hezbollah has blamed Israel and vowed retribution while Lebanese officials urged citizens who possess pagers to discard them.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it will not be commenting. However, in its first statement since the explosions, the IDF said there were no changes in its advice to civilians.
     
            The attacks have ratcheted up tension in the Middle East. Here’s what you need to know:
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke twice with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, on Tuesday, according to two US defense officials. The officials would not specify at exactly what time the two calls took place. 
     
            Though Austin and Gallant are in regular contact, it’s uncommon to schedule two calls in one day and shows how seriously the US views the current situation. When Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones at Israel on April 13, the two also spoke twice.
     
            At a press briefing earlier Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said only that the two “spoke by phone today” without specifying how many times.
     
        “The secretary reiterated the need for a ceasefire and hostage deal, and the importance of reducing tensions through diplomacy to prevent the potential for a wider regional conflict,” Ryder said.
     
 
            The exact cause of the pager explosions in Lebanon hasn’t been confirmed yet, and the news is developing by the minute. So far, experts who spoke to CNN said the explosions were most likely triggered by hardware tampering rather than another theory of a cybersecurity breach causing lithium batteries to heat up and explode – but neither has been confirmed by authorities.
     
        In short, your communications device is not at risk for exploding unless it’s heavily tampered with and laced with explosives, experts who spoke to CNN said.
     
 
            Pagers are wireless devices that can send messages without an internet connection. Though they’ve lost popularity to cell phones, some fields like healthcare still depend on them.
     
            Justin Cappos, a cybersecurity professor at NYU, said that it’s possible to cause damage to a variety of batteries – most commonly lithium batteries, which have caused dangerous fires. But he said it seems like the “devices were intentionally designed to explode when triggered, not a pager that everyone else in the world is using.”
     
            “If you’re a normal person with a lithium-ion battery I would not be over-concerned about this,” Cappos said.
     
            Baptiste Robert, a cybersecurity researcher and the CEO of Predicta Lab, said that rather than being hacked, the pagers were likely modified before shipping. He said the scale of the explosion seems to show it’s a coordinated and sophisticated attack.
     
            When it comes to battery safety, the National Fire Protection Association has a set of safety guidelines for lithium batteries, such as properly disposing of them. The association also said people should stop using devices with lithium-ion batteries if the battery shows any sign of damage due to risk of fire or explosion.
     
            It’s unclear what kind of battery the pagers in question had. A Lebanese security source told CNN that Hezbollah had recently purchased the devices.
     
CNN’s Christian Edwards, Adrienne Vogt and Aditi Sangal contributed to this report.
 
            European airlines Air France and Lufthansa are suspending flights to Tel Aviv at least through Thursday “due to the security situation locally.” 
     
            Air France is also suspending flights to Beirut through Thursday, amid fears of escalation in the region. 
     
            The announcements come after exploding pagers in Lebanon killed at least nine people and injured thousands on Tuesday. 
     
            The pager explosions in Lebanon “mark an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context,” according to Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN special coordinator for Lebanon.
     
            In a statement from her office, she condemned the attack that Lebanon says killed nine and injured thousands of others.
     
        “In accordance with international humanitarian law, she reminds all concerned actors that civilians are not a target and must be protected at all times. Even one civilian casualty is one too many,” the statement read.
     
 
            She also urged “all concerned actors to refrain from any further action, or bellicose rhetoric, which could trigger a wider conflagration that nobody can afford.”
     
            Hennis-Plasschaert also called for stability in the region to be prioritized.
     
            “Too much is at stake to do anything less,” the statement said.
     
            Hezbollah has long touted secrecy as a cornerstone of its military strategy, forgoing high-tech devices to avoid infiltration from Israeli and US spyware. 
     
            In a televised address over six months ago, Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah called on Hezbollah members and their families in southern Lebanon, where fighting with Israeli forces across the border has raged for nearly a year, to forgo their cell phones.
     
        “Shut it off, bury it, put it in an iron chest and lock it up,” he said in a speech in February. “Do it for the sake of security and to protect the blood and dignity of people.”
     
 
            “The collaborator (with the Israelis) is the cell phone in your hands, and those of your wife and your children. This cell phone is the collaborator and the killer,” he went on to say in his fiery speech. 
     
            Unlike other non-state actors in the Middle East, Hezbollah units are believed to communicate through an internal communications network. 
     
            This is considered one of the key building blocks of the powerful group that has long been accused of operating as a state-within-a-state. 
     
            The pagers – for decades obsolete to most people in Lebanon – would have served to prompt Hezbollah members to contact one another through those phone lines.
     
            In addition to causing a mass-casualty event across several parts of Lebanon, the apparent infiltration of those pagers, one step removed from their actual networks, will have rattled the Iran-backed group.
     
            In its bid to escape Israel’s radar, its back-to-basics approach appears to have literally backfired in a way that they would have least expected.
     
            Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid is returning to Israel from the US sooner than expected, following the pager explosions on Tuesday that Lebanon says killed nine people and injured around 2,800.  
     
            His spokesperson Yair Zivan said Lapid was forced to change his plans due to the situation in the region.  
     
            Lapid had traveled to the US on Sunday to discuss the negotiations over a ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas. 
     
            On Monday, Lapid met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington. Following their meeting, he called on the Netanyahu government to do more to secure an agreement, adding that he would give the prime minister “any necessary safety net in order to make the deal.” 
     
            Lapid also met former US President Barack Obama as well as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan during his trip. 
     
            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has blamed Israel for the deadly pager explosions in Lebanon, calling it “Israeli terrorism,” in a phone call with Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib on Tuesday. 
     
            Araghchi posted to X offering condolences to the families of the victims and the injured, pledging to provide necessary medical assistance. 
     
            According to Iranian state outlet Press TV, Araghchi specifically inquired about the condition of Iranian Ambassador Mojtaba Amani, who was injured in the explosions, and thanked Lebanon for promptly treating him. 
     
            Araghchi also spoke with Amani’s wife, ensuring Iran’s support for his recovery and offering assistance for his possible transfer to Tehran. 
     
            The pagers that exploded were new and had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, a Lebanese security source has told CNN.  
     
            The source did not provide any information on the exact date the pagers were purchased or their model.
     
            Jordan on Tuesday said it would be ready to provide “any medical assistance needed by the Lebanese medical sector to treat thousands of Lebanese citizens who were injured,” following the deadly pager explosions.
     
            During a phone call with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi reiterated “Jordan’s support for Lebanon’s security, sovereignty and stability,” Jordan’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
     
            Safadi also stressed the need to “stop the dangerous escalation witnessed in the region, through an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression on Gaza.”
     
            Hamas has expressed solidarity with Hezbollah and the Lebanese people following the deadly pager explosions. 
     
            Blaming Israel for the explosions, the group said in a statement, “We, in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), strongly condemn the Zionist terrorist aggression that targeted Lebanese citizens by detonating communication devices in various areas of Lebanese territories, as well as civilian and service facilities.” 
     
            “We value the jihad and sacrifices of our brothers in Hezbollah, and their determination to continue supporting and backing our Palestinian people in Gaza. We express our full solidarity with the Lebanese people and our brothers in Hezbollah, offering our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims,” Hamas said. 
     
            The Israeli military said earlier that it will not be commenting on the incident. 
     
For context: The pager explosions come amid increased hostility between Hezbollah and Israel, raising tensions in the region that have been heightened since Hamas’ attack on Israel in October 2023 and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza. 
     
            Kim Ghattas, a Lebanese journalist and contributing writer to The Atlantic magazine, told CNN that Hezbollah had recently “gone low tech” in an attempt to prevent more of its operatives from being assassinated.
     
        “It was clearly a targeted attack by Israel against Hezbollah operatives who had gone low tech, because they have been the target of assassinations over the past 10 months. They’ve been instructed to dump their iPhones, get off the internet and disconnect their CCTVs,” Ghattas told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
     
 
            Israel has not yet commented on the explosions. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel for the attack.
     
            Asked why Israel might have launched such an attack, Ghattas said there are two main explanations.
     
        “It’s either a way to try to demonstrate to Hezbollah that Israel knows everything about them… To try, in essence, to cow Hezbollah into submission, and make clear that an increase of their attacks against Israel will be met with even further violence,” she said. “Or, it could be a prelude to an Israeli large-scale campaign against [Lebanon], at a time when Hezbollah is facing the chaos of this latest very science-fiction-like attack against its operatives.”
     
 
Background: In a speech in February, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah called on his fighters to do away with their mobile phones, telling them, “shut it off, bury it, put it in an iron chest and lock it up.”
     
            “Do it for the sake of security and to protect the blood and dignity of people,” Nasrallah said, adding, “The collaborator (with the Israelis) is the cell phone in your hands, and those of your wife and your children. This cell phone is the collaborator and the killer.” 
     
            The US was “not involved” in the series of pager explosions in Lebanon and was “not aware” of any attack in advance, according to a State Department spokesperson.
     
        “The US was not aware of this incident in advance, and at this point, we’re gathering information,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, who repeatedly referred to the matter as an “incident” not an “attack.”
     
 
            Miller would not say what information the US has so far, and would not say whether the US assesses that Israel is responsible or not.
     
            Hezbollah and Lebanon have both blamed Israel for the attack, which injured about 2,800 people and killed at least nine people, according to the Lebanese health minister. The Israel Defense Forces did not comment.
     
            “I don’t have any assessment to offer one way or other at this point,” said Miller.
     
            Miller would not say if the US would make its own assessment, but said it was “gathering information through all of the ways in which we usually gather information.”
     
        “We’re gathering information through diplomatic channels as well as other channels about this incident,” he said, but would not say if the US has had conversations with Israeli or Lebanese officials. 
     
 
            “I don’t want to prejudge what we’ll say in the days to come,” Miller said. 
     
            Asked if there were indications that Iran could retaliate, given reports that the Iranian ambassador was injured, Miller said he did not want to speculate until those reports were confirmed. 
     
            “I’ve seen the reports. I don’t want to speak to what the implications might be before a report is confirmed. But certainly, as is always the case, we would urge Iran not to take advantage of any incident, any instability, to try to add further instability and to further increase tensions in the region. That has been our message to Iran since October 7,” he said. 
     
            Miller also repeated that the US believes there needs to be a diplomatic solution to the conflict in northern Israel with Hezbollah, and that it is important for Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in order to make a diplomatic resolution in the north easier. 
     
            Miller said it is “very, very difficult to get a diplomatic resolution in the north absent a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, absent a ceasefire in Gaza, which is why we continue to push for that ceasefire, because we think it’ll help make it much easier to reach a resolution.”
     
            Miller would not say how the US views this attack affecting the ceasefire talks.
     
            Schools in Lebanon will close on Wednesday following the pager explosions that killed at least nine people and injured around 2,800, according to the state-run Lebanese news outlet NNA.    
     
            Citing Education Minister Abbas al-Halabi, NNA reported that technical institutes as well as the Lebanese University and all private higher education institutions would also close “in condemnation of the criminal act committed by the Israeli enemy against citizens, which caused martyrdom and wounded thousands.”  
     
            In its first statement since the deadly pager explosions, the Israeli military said there were no changes in its advice to civilians. 
     
            “The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) spokesperson clarifies that at this time there is no change to the Home Front Command defensive guidelines. The public are asked to remain alert and vigilant, and any change in policy will be updated immediately,” the military said in a statement. 
     
            Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a situational assessment on Tuesday evening “focusing on readiness in both offense and defense in all arenas,” it added. 
     
            Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel for killing at least nine people and injuring 2,800 in an attack that targeted pagers held by members of Hezbollah, according to the country’s health minister. 
     
            The Israeli military said earlier that it will not be commenting on the incident. 
     
            For most of the past year, cross-border skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah have been the daily background music to life in Lebanon.
     
            But Tuesday’s exploding pagers attack represents a level of escalation that is perhaps even greater than the assassination of Fu’ad Shukr, the senior Hezbollah commander killed by an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb in lateJuly.
     
            Although Israel is refusing to comment on the explosions, Hezbollah has said it holds Israel “fully responsible for this criminal attack.” The Lebanese government has also blamed Israel for the attack.
     
        The simultaneous explosion of hundreds of pagers across Lebanon represents a physical and symbolic hit on Hezbollah that was landed, presumably, by Israel.
     
 
            In fact, this is just the latest in a series of blows to the militant group. After the assassination of Shukr, Hezbollah waited nearly four weeks to launch its response, firing some 300 rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation, the majority of which were shot down by Israeli air defenses.
     
            Now, perhaps thousands of Hezbollah militants have been injured in the pager explosions—a major blow to the Iranian-backed group. The explosions underscore Hezbollah’s profound vulnerability to Israeli infiltration of its intelligence and communications networks.
     
            All of which raises questions about how a crippled and compromised Hezbollah can respond to this latest Israeli coup.  
     
            Experts have shared two competing theories as to how hundreds of pagers could have exploded simultaneously.
     
            One theory is that there was a cybersecurity breach, causing the pagers’ lithium batteries to overheat and detonate.
     
            Another is that this was a “supply chain attack,” where the pagers were tampered with during the manufacturing and shipping process.
     
            David Kennedy, a former US National Security Agency intelligence analyst, told CNN that the explosions seen in videos shared online appear to be “too large for this to be a remote and direct hack that would overload the pager and cause a lithium battery explosion.”
     
            Kennedy said he found the second theory to be more plausible.
     
            “It’s more likely that Israel had human operatives… in Hezbollah… The pagers would have been implanted with explosives and likely only to detonate when a certain message was received,” he said.
     
        “The complexity needed to pull this off is incredible. It would have required many different intelligence components and execution. Human intelligence (HUMINT) would be the main method used to pull this off, along with intercepting the supply chain in order to make modifications to the pagers,” he added.
     
 
            Ambulance crews based in northern Lebanon are being deployed to Beirut following the pager explosions, according to the Lebanese Ambulance Association. 
     
            “Teams of ambulance crews working in the north in the centers of Tripoli and Qalamoun headed to the capital to participate in the ambulance and transportation work alongside the various concerned agencies,” the association said in a statement Tuesday. 
     
        “The association calls on all citizens to facilitate the work of ambulance crews,” it added. 
     
 
            The explosions that killed at least nine people, including a child, and injured around 2,800 affected several areas in Lebanon, but particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, the capital, according to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces. 
     
            State media NNA reported that “hacked” pager devices also exploded in the towns of Ali Al-Nahri and Riyaq in Lebanon’s central Beqaa valley, causing a significant number of injuries. 
     
            The Lebanese government has blamed Israel for Tuesday’s pager explosions, condemning the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression.”
     
            Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the attack represents “criminal Israeli aggression, which constitutes a serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards,” according to the state-run NNA news outlet.  
     
            Ziad Makary, the information minister, said in a news conference in Beirut that the Lebanese government has contacted the United Nations and the concerned countries “to hold them accountable for this continuing crime.” 
     
            The Israeli military said earlier on Tuesday it would not be commenting on the incidents. 
     
            The pager explosions have left Hezbollah with few good options in its conflict with Israel, says Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.
     
            Although Israel has not commented on the explosions, Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have said they hold Israel responsible.
     
        “Hezbollah is stuck between a rock and a hard place. They’ve been taking, literally, a beating over the past year. They’ve lost more than 450 members of the organization, significant damage to their infrastructure – and now this,” Yahya told CNN.
     
 
            “They’ve lost the deterrence – they haven’t lost it completely, but they’ve been hemorrhaging, if you like, a lot of their deterrence,” she added.
     
            Yahya said how Hezbollah responds to the explosions could be influenced by Israel’s next move.
     
        “Is this also a first step in a broader escalation that Israel is planning? Because we’ve also been hearing from the Israeli government that they would like to expand the conflict into Lebanon in a more significant way than what we’ve seen so far,” she said, referring to a string of bellicose statements by Israeli officials contemplating a wider confrontation with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
     
 
            Hezbollah has placed responsibility for the deadly pager explosions in Lebanon on Israel, and vowed retribution. 
     
        “We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal attack which led to the martyrdom of several people, impacted civilians and injured a large number of people with various types of injuries,” the Lebanese militant group said in a statement released Tuesday evening.  
     
 
            “This criminal and treacherous enemy will definitely receive a fair punishment for this sinful assault, both in ways that are expected and unexpected,” Hezbollah added.  
     
            The Israeli military, which has engaged in tit-for-tat strikes with Hezbollah for months, said it would not be commenting on the incident. 
     
            At least 170 people injured in the explosions in Lebanon are in critical condition, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said in an interview with Al Jazeera.
     
            The majority of those injuries are in the abdomen, hand and face, particularly in the eye area, he said earlier at a news conference in Beirut. 
     
            Abiad added that many hospitals in southern Lebanon have exceeded capacity due to the sheer number of injured people arriving. More than 100 hospitals in Lebanon — largely in the southern suburbs of Beirut, southern Lebanon and the Beqaa valley — received injured people. 
     
            Earlier on Tuesday, the Lebanese Ministry of Health called for health workers to urgently report to work given the “large number of injured people being transferred to hospitals” following the pager explosions. Officials have also called for people to donate blood in anticipation of increased need. 
     
            Seth Jones, the director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ International Security Program, told CNN that Hezbollah will “have to respond” to Tuesday’s pager explosions in Lebanon.
     
        “When I was recently in Israel and visited the border areas, the Israeli perspective right now is that the situation with the north is untenable,” Jones told CNN, while stressing that Israel has not yet commented on the pager explosions.
     
 
            “Now that we’re seeing Israel start to wrap up the war in Gaza, they are starting to turn north,” he said. “Israel is really trying to change the situation on the ground and create some sense of security on its northern border.”
     
            Although Hezbollah’s response to the Israeli assassination of the senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in a Beirut suburb in July was “relatively muted,” Jones said Hezbollah will now have no choice but to retaliate.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously estimated that Hezbollah has approximately 150,000 rockets and missiles, including thousands of precision munitions.
     
        “If this thing continues to creep up the escalatory ladder, Hezbollah has a lot that they can throw at Israel,” Jones warned.
     
 
            At least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, have been killed by Tuesday’s pager explosions, Lebanon’s health minister Firass Abiad said in an interview with Al Jazeera.
     
            Some 2,800 others have been injured in the incidents, Abiad added.
     
This post has been updated with the number of deaths. 
 
            The pager explosions come after Israel’s security cabinet voted Monday to add another war objective to its ongoing conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to its homes.
     
        “Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Monday.
     
 
            After nearly a year of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes in southern Lebanon and northern Israel.
     
            While the return of residents of northern Israel has long been understood to be a political necessity for Netanyahu’s government, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal.
     
            Before Monday’s vote, Netanyahu had said it won’t be possible to return residents to the north without a “fundamental change in the security situation” along the border, his office said. 
     
            He added that Israel will “do what is necessary” to return residents to their homes.
     
            Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was more explicit, saying the only way to allow the residents to return home is “through military action.”
     
            Israel’s military has not yet commented on Tuesday’s explosions.
     
            The pager explosion incident in Lebanon on Tuesday killed three people, including a child and two members of the militant group, Hezbollah said on its Telegram channel on Tuesday. 
     
            The explosions occurred around 3:30 p.m. local time and impacted “workers” in various Hezbollah institutions, the group said, adding that a “large number” of people were injured. 
     
            Hezbollah said its security apparatus has launched an investigation into the incident, stopping short of blaming any party for it.  
     
        “We confirm that the resistance at all levels and various units is at the highest level of readiness to defend Lebanon and its steadfast people,” it said. 
     
 
            Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured in a pager explosion on Tuesday in Beirut, according to Iranian state media IRNA.
     
            Amani has a superficial injury and is currently under observation in the hospital, IRNA reported, citing his wife.
     
            Two employees of the Iranian embassy were also injured, according to Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency.
     
            The explosions impacted several areas in Lebanon, particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, according to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces. 
     
            Explosions reportedly occurred in:

            Footage shared online shows people in Lebanon going about their days before their pagers exploded.
     
            In one video, a man is seen shopping in a fruit and vegetable market before an object explodes from his midriff. The man collapses to the ground and cries out in pain, while other bystanders scatter in fear.
     
            In another, security camera footage shows a man about to pay for goods at a store before something on his person explodes, sending a burst of smoke into the air.
     
            In another, a person films the damage inside a bedroom after an apparent explosion. Two holes have been torn through the top and bottom of a drawer, smashing a nearby mirror and scattering debris across the room.
     
            CNN has not been able to independently verify the videos.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it will not be commenting on the reported explosions in Lebanon.
     
            Since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on October 7, there have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border.
     
            Health workers across Lebanon are being asked to report to work given the “large number of injured people being transferred to hospitals” following Tuesday’s pager explosions, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health said.
     
            Officials have also called for people to donate blood in anticipation of increased need.
     
            Hundreds of people in Lebanon have been injured in an attack targeting the pagers of Hezbollah members, a Lebanese security source told CNN Tuesday.

            A family member of Carmel Gat – whose body was among the six deceased hostages discovered in a Hamas tunnel earlier this month – has called for her “memory to be a deal” following the release of new video showing the dire conditions of her captivity.
     
            In a poignant Facebook post, Gat’s cousin Gil Dickmann called on Tuesday for his cousin’s death to be the impetus for Israel’s government to negotiate a hostage release deal with Hamas, nearly a year after the October 7 attacks.
     
            Responding to video released Tuesday by the Israel military that shows low ceilings and squalid conditions in the tunnel where the hostages are thought to have been kept, Dickmann accused Israel of wasting time while captives in Gaza languished in a “torture chamber” underground. 
     
            “This torture did not kill them. What killed them was that the military pressure reached them, before the deal did,” Dickmann wrote.
     
            “When I saw the shocking tunnel video that you will all see starting tonight, I couldn’t help but imagine Carmel there. She is almost my height. About 1.74 meters. There’s no way she can stand up straight there. I thought about the suffocation and the filth, about the darkness and heat that would drive one mad,” Dickmann wrote.
     
            “The answer to this video, and to this murder, cannot be killing or revenge. There is no connection between Carmel and revenge. The answer to death is no more death. She is life. The answer must be a deal that will bring home alive the hostages who are still there - and the murdered for burial. Sorry Carmeli. May your memory be a deal,” Dickmann added.
     
            “May their memory be a blessing” is a common saying in Jewish tradition after a death.
     
            The Hostages and Families Forum described the IDF video as “shocking” in a statement released Tuesday, and called for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza: 
     
            “Hungry, exhausted, tortured, they cling to a single hope: that we will continue fighting for their freedom. They trust us to bring them home … Time is running out! That light, that hope, cannot die. A deal must be signed NOW!”
     
            Israeli forces didn’t “have the intelligence” needed to launch a rescue mission for six hostages whose bodies were recovered from an underground tunnel in Gaza earlier this month, IDF chief spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Tuesday. 
     
            “We didn’t have the intelligence that enabled us to conduct a rescue operation. We didn’t know the exact location of the hostages in the tunnel,” he said.
     
            “They were murdered before we reached that point,” Hagari added.
     
            After describing the “difficult conditions” the hostages were held in, Hagari said the IDF is currently aware of “other hostages who are being held in these conditions.”  
     
            Over 100 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza.
     
            The Israeli military will use evidence found inside a Gaza tunnel to investigate the murder of six hostages held there, spokesman Daniel Hagari said Tuesday. 
     
            After showing a pre-recorded video of himself exploring the tunnel where the hostages’ bodies were discovered earlier this month, Hagari told a press briefing that “all the findings you saw inside the tunnel were taken for investigation and testing. We are checking the materials, and we are exhausting every lead in order to get to the terrorists who are responsible for the vile murder.”
     
Some background: The bodies of six hostages held by Hamas were recovered from an underground tunnel in Gaza on Sunday, September 1. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at the time that their bodies had been found in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they had been “brutally” murdered “a short while” before Israeli troops were able to reach them. 
     
            The discovery touched off a massive wave of protests in Israel over the Israeli government’s failure to reach a ceasefire-and-hostage-release deal with Hamas, which controls Gaza.
     
            The Israeli military’s chief spokesperson has shown the interior of the Gaza tunnel where six hostages were murdered before their bodies were retrieved by Israeli forces on Sept. 1.
     
            During a press conference Tuesday, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari showed a pre-recorded video of himself exploring the tunnel, which he said was located 20 meters underground and was not high enough to stand in.
     
            Holding a flashlight, Hagari also showed some of the items Israeli soldiers found in the tunnel: Empty and full bottles, a hairbrush, and baby wipes were among the items visibly scattered along the tunnel’s corridor. 
     
             He said it would have been “very hard” for the hostages to survive in the tunnel’s “difficult” conditions, describing them as “heroes.”
     
            “They were here in this tunnel in horrific conditions, where there is no air to breathe, where you cannot stand,” he said.
     
            “They survived, but they were murdered by terrorists,” he said.
     
            There have been two major developments from the Middle East today, with dozens killed and injured in an Israeli strike targeting “senior Hamas terrorists” in a humanitarian zone in the south and separately, Israel accepting responsibility for the killing of an American activist.
     
If you’re just joining our coverage, here’s what to know: 
 
Al-Mawasi strike:
     
Killing of American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi:
 
            The family of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, the American activist who was killed while protesting in the West Bank on Friday, said they were “deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional.” 
     
            Eygi, a Turkish-American woman, was shot in the head by Israeli forces responding to a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita, according to two eyewitnesses who spoke to CNN. 
     
            Israel investigated her killing, saying on Tuesday that she was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire.”
 
            Her family rejected the finding, describing the investigation as “wholly inadequate.”
     
            “Ayşenur, an activist and volunteer, was peacefully standing for justice as an international observer and witness to Palestinian suffering; she was taking shelter in an olive grove when she was shot in the head and killed by a bullet from an Israeli soldier,” her family wrote in a statement posted to X by the Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU).
 
        This cannot be misconstrued as anything except a deliberate, targeted and precise attack by the military against an unarmed civilian.”
     
 
            The family called for US government leaders to order their own independent investigation into what they said was a deliberate targeting and killing of a US citizen. 
     
            Earlier on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Eygi’s killing as “both unprovoked and unjustified” and said Israeli security forces needed to make “fundamental changes” to how they operate in the West Bank.
     
            International aid groups have once again raised alarm over attacks on designated humanitarian zones across Gaza following Israel’s overnight strikes that left at least 19 people dead.
 
            The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) called the designated humanitarian areas as “safe zones in name only,” noting that “Israel’s unlawful relocation directives have failed to protect or offer any guarantees of safety for Palestinians.” 
     
        “This area, where civilians killed in Monday’s strikes were seeking shelter, is now reduced to around 13% of Gaza and has a population density of more than 30,000 people per square kilometre,” the organization said in a statement. 
     
 
            The NRC described the images showing the aftermath of the strike as “horrifying,” noting that for “11 months, Israel has been forcing Palestinians in Gaza to flee from place to place without offering them genuine assurances of safety, proper accommodation or return once hostilities end.”
     
            Separately, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), a UK based non-governmental organization, described the humanitarian zone as a “so-called humanitarian zone” and said their teams on the ground were “exhausted and traumatised.” 
     
            “We call on the international community to uphold its responsibility to protect Palestinians from further atrocities, including by immediately halting all arms transfers to Israel,” Fikr Shalltoot, the Gaza Director at MAP, said. 
     
            Survivors of an Israeli strike in Al-Mawasi on Tuesday described the horror of looking for their loved ones in the middle of the night. 
     
            CNN footage from the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis shows men and boys performing Islamic funeral prayers for those killed in the strike, as rays of sunlight beam onto the courtyard of the medical facility. 
     
            The video shows Palestinians carrying the bodies of the victims, including children, in white shrouds, as women wail out on the steps of the hospital. 
     
            “People thought they were asleep safely. Suddenly we woke up to the sounds of explosions, and fires were surrounding us from every side. We didn’t know where the strike hit, where the remains are, or where the blood is. Everything was scattered,” one eyewitness, Mahmoud Al Nims, told CNN. 
     
        You wake up in the middle of the night not sure if it’s a dream or reality… My message is that if this is life, we don’t need it.” 
     
 
            The Israeli military struck the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in what it said was an operation targeting Hamas fighters. Hamas has denied having fighters in the area. 
     
            Israeli authorities have placed nearly 86% of the Gaza Strip under evacuation orders, according to the UN. At least 1.9 million people, almost the entire population of Gaza, has been displaced, according to the UN. Many were forced to flee multiple times.
     
            “Children are orphans, parents lost their children,” said another Palestinian, Taghreed Abu Assi. “They told us to go to Mawasi and we did, and they strike us. We have been displaced a hundred times.”
     
            Dozens of displaced Gazans dug through the sand following Israeli strikes on Al-Mawasi, trying to recover what remained of their belongings, footage obtained by CNN showed. 
     
            At least 19 Palestinians were killed in the strikes on the Israeli-designated humanitarian safe zone overnight, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. 
     
            Poles that used to hold up tents were protruding from the sand, but everything else is buried. Mattresses, blankets and clothes were scattered around another – much bigger — crater on the other side of the camp. Dozens of people were staring into the gaping cavity. 
     
            Some survivors pulled canned food from under the sand. A girl with an injured hand watched as those around her attempted to rebuild their tents. 
     
            Eyewitness Mohammad Jarrour told CNN that the camp was awoken to one, “then two, three, four, five strikes.”
     
        “The sound alone was terrifying and deadly. The sound by itself made you not know what to do—whether to search for your son, daughter, or brother. We couldn’t comprehend where the strike was happening in the darkness of the night,” he said. 
     
 
            Another witness Salem Abu Jara told CNN that Palestinians had been told the area was safe.
     
            “Where is the safety? There is no safety. The Israelis offer no safety,” he said. 
     
        “The situation is difficult…more than difficult. The children still cannot sleep or calm down. Nothing like this has ever happened in this area before. They tell us these are safe areas, and we go there, but where should we go? People have been displaced 10 or 15 times….where can they go after that?”
     
 
            Two weapons experts told CNN that the visual evidence from the scene of the Al-Mawasi strike suggests 2,000 pound bombs were used. 
     
            Trevor Ball told CNN that the remnants found at the scene appear to be parts of the tip of the tail of the thermal battery section of a Spice 2000 bomb guidance kit. 
     
            Ball, who is a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, also said that the crater and the weapon remnants were consistent with the use of multiple Mk 84s 2,000 pound bombs.
     
            Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), also told CNN that the evidence from the scene suggests a 2,000-pound bomb was used. He said:
     
        “The significant damage and the size of the craters align with the expected effects of aerial bombs weighing several hundred kilograms. One fragment is visually consistent with the tail section of a SPICE 2000 guidance kit, suggesting that at least one 2,000-pound bomb was employed.”
     
 
            “The SPICE 2000 kit can be attached to a variety of 2,000 pound unguided aerial bombs, turning them into highly precise munitions,” he added. 
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described the killing of American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi in the occupied West Bank on Friday as unacceptable. 
     
            Speaking at a joint news conference in London on Tuesday with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Blinken said that “no one” should be “shot and killed for attending a protest.”
     
            His comments came in response to a question about whether the US accepted Israel’s assessment of how Eygi was killed. Blinken said the Israeli security forces needed to make “fundamental changes” to how they operate in the West Bank.
     
            On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was highly likely that American activist Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire,” following an investigation into her death. The military said the shot was not aimed at the activist but at “the key instigator” of a “violent riot” at the Beita Junction where it said Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at Israeli security forces. It didn’t name the alleged instigator.
     
        “Her killing was both unprovoked and unjustified. No one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest. No one should have to put their life at risk just for expressing their views,” Blinken said.“In our judgement, Israeli security forces need to make some fundamental changes in the way that they operate in the West Bank including changes to the rules of engagement,” Blinken said. 
     
 
            Blinken added that the United States had “long seen” reports of Israeli forces ignoring extremist settler violence against Palestinians and reports of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians.
     
        “Now we have the second American citizen killed at the hands of Israeli security forces. It’s not acceptable. It has to change. And we’ll be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government,” Blinken said.
     
 
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Tuesday that it is highly likely that American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was killed in the occupied West Bank on Friday, was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire.”
     
            The military said that the shot was not aimed at the activist, but at “the key instigator” of a “violent riot” at the Beita Junction where it said Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at Israeli security forces. It didn’t name the alleged instigator.
     
            The IDF said that an investigation was launched by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID), the findings of which will be submitted for review by the Military Advocate General’s Corps.
     
            Eyewitnesses told CNN on Friday that the 26-year-old activist, who is also a Turkish citizen, had been participating in a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita.
     
            The Ministry of Health in Gaza says at least 19 bodies have arrived at hospitals from the designated humanitarian safe zone in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza that was hit by an Israeli strike overnight. 
     
            Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza’s Civil Defense had said that at least 40 people were killed in the strike. 
     
            The reason for the discrepancy in the two figures was not immediately clear. 
     
            The overnight strike on a humanitarian safe zone in Gaza that killed at least 19 Palestinians, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health, comes just hours after children across the strip should have been returning to school on Monday. 
     
            It is not yet clear how many of those killed in the strike are children, but “entire families have disappeared in the sand,” Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal said.  Almost half of Gaza’s population are children. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the facility to eliminate Hamas terrorists who were operating from within the humanitarian zone. 
     
            On September 9, Save The Children posted to Instagram that after nearly a year of war, “hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza are missing yet another year of education.”
     
            “Every day away from the classroom means lost learning, missed opportunities and a future that grows more uncertain,” the organization wrote. 
     
        “In Gaza, schools sheltering Palestinian families have faced relentless attacks by Israeli forces, destroying lives, futures and the entire education system. The lives of tens of thousands of Palestinian students, teachers, and displaced families sheltering in schools have been lost in the war.” 
     
 
            Separately to the strike in Al-Mawasi, at least six people, including two children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday near three polio vaccination centers east of Gaza City, according to the Gaza Civil Defence and information provided by a medical source at Al-Ahli Baptist hospital. 
     
            The strike hit a food stand in Al-Shawa Square in the eastern part of Gaza City, according to the Civil Defense. According to the source at the hospital, it was a falafel stand and the man who owned it was killed.
     
            The site is close to three schools serving as polio vaccination centers, according to a list published by the Gaza Health Ministry.
     
            The Al-Tufah, Al-Saftawi, and Yaffa schools are located only several hundred meters from Al-Shawa square, according to a CNN analysis of satellite imagery. 
     
            A further four people were wounded in the strike, according to Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal. 
     
Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.
 
            The Israeli military said Tuesday that its air force was targeting “a number of senior Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control center” in the humanitarian zone it struck overnight in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza.
     
            At least 19 bodies arrived at hospitals from the designated humanitarian safe zone in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza that was hit by the strike, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
     
            Among those targeted were Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, who the Israeli military says was the head of Hamas’ aerial unit in Gaza, Osama Tabesh, who was “the head of the observation and targets department in Hamas’ military intelligence headquarters,” and Ayman Mabhouh, who it said was “another senior Hamas terrorist.”
     
            Israel did not provide any more information about the alleged Hamas militants. CNN is working to independently verify the claims and is seeking more information. 
     
            It said the targets were “directly involved in the execution” of the October 7 attack on Israel and have been planning to “carry out terror activities” against the military and the country, it said.
     
            An Israeli strike on the sandy tent camp of Al-Mawasi has killed at least 19 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. 
     
            Earlier, Gaza’s Civil Defense reported that at least 40 Palestinians were killed, and more than 60 others were wounded.
     
            The reason for the discrepancy in the two figures was not immediately clear.
     
            The attack hit a coastal area in southern Gaza, to which tens of thousands of people had fled Israel’s bombardment of other parts of the enclave. Many were living in thin tents with sparse infrastructure and little access to relief. 
     
            Eyewitnesses reported that at least five missiles struck the area.
     
What does Israel say? The Israeli military said it “struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command-and-control center embedded inside the humanitarian area” in Khan Younis. 
     
            In July, Israeli officials said Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif was among at least 90 Palestinians killed in a strike in Al-Mawasi.
     
What does Hamas say? The militant group said Israel’s statement that its fighters were in the area “a blatant lie, through which it (Israel) seeks to justify these heinous crimes.” Hamas said “dozens of unarmed civilians, most of whom were children and women” were killed in the strike.
     
What do rescue workers say? Local teams say they are struggling to recover people buried under sand and debris in scant light, as the Israeli offensive has depleted humanitarian resources in Gaza. 
     
            About 20 to 40 tents were destroyed, and “entire families have disappeared in the sand,” said Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal. 
     
            The explosion created three large craters, Bassal said.
     
            Emergency crews wearing bright orange vests scoured dense, blown-out debris in Al-Mawasi on Tuesday after an Israeli strike on the coastal tent camp in southern Gaza killed at least 19 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. 
     
            CNN footage from the aftermath shows rescue personnel hauling large pieces of barbed wire, dusty mattresses, clothes, and blankets from debris in the dark after the attack at 1 a.m. local time.  
     
            “All those here are our relatives, our neighbors. It’s poor people, people who ran away from airstrikes and bombardments. They said this area is safe,” one eyewitness told CNN. 
     
        “They are normal people, they are not resistant (fighters) or anything,” he said of the deceased. “There are so many martyrs… There must be so many others under the ground. They are mostly children and women.”
     
 
            The eyewitness said the people in Al-Mawasi had rented land after fleeing bombardment elsewhere.
     
        “People run from one place to another, they tell them to go to Mawasi, to the safe places, so they come. They struggle and suffer to pay for the tent they stay in.”
     
 
            Families of several American hostages held in Gaza are calling on US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to offer new ideas for securing the immediate release of their loved ones.
     
        “We want to hear that they care. We want to hear that both candidates understand and acknowledge there are seven Americans still in captivity, and that the US is fully committed to bringing them back,” Ronen Neutra, a US-Israeli dual citizen from New York, told CNN. 
     
 
            His 22-year-old son, Omer, is a serving Israeli soldier and was abducted by Hamas during the October 7 attacks.
     
            CNN spoke with relatives of three US citizens held in Gaza who expressed frustration that attempts to free their family members had failed.
     
            “Enough is enough,” said Adi Alexander, whose 20-year-old son Edan was serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7.
     
        “Perhaps the deal proposed by President (Joe) Biden back in December was good then, but maybe we need something different now.”
     
 
            All the family members who spoke to CNN said they were looking to the Biden administration, as well as Trump and Harris, to find creative ways to increase pressure on Hamas and Israel to reach a new deal.
     
            “We want to hear new ideas from both candidates and for them to commit to adopting a fresh approach to all the players,” said Ruby Chen, another US-Israeli citizen whose 19-year-old son, Itay, was killed during the attacks last year. His body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza.
     
            The family members told CNN that approaches should include the US seeking new pressure points on Hamas and its sponsor, Iran, as well as on other nations with potential influence, like Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar, the Gulf state that hosts Hamas officials and has helped facilitate negotiations.

            The Israeli military detained a convoy of United Nations vehicles for several hours in northern Gaza on Monday.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were acting “following intelligence that a number of Palestinian suspects were present in the convoy” and delayed it to question them.
     
            The IDF said the convoy was not involved in transporting polio vaccines but was being used instead to exchange UN personnel.
     
            A military official later told CNN the suspects and the convoy had been released.
     
            Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the UNWRA – the UN’s main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief – said the convoy was stopped at gunpoint after the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and held for more than eight hours despite “prior detailed coordination.”
     
            During that time, bulldozers caused heavy damage to the UN armored vehicles, he said.
     
            Lazzarini said the convoy contained national and international staff members who were meant to roll out the UN’s polio vaccination campaign for children in Gaza City and northern Gaza. He added the agency could not confirm whether they could continue their work today.
     
        “This significant incident is the latest in a series of violations against UN staff including shootings at convoys and arrests by the Israeli Armed Forces at checkpoints despite prior notification,” Lazzarini said.

            Discussions to try to finalize the Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal will continue over the coming days, with teams remaining in Cairo to iron out remaining issues, a US official said Sunday.
     
        “Senior level talks in Cairo over recent days, including with representatives from Hamas and Israel, have been constructive and were conducted in a spirit on all sides to reach a final and implementable agreement,” a US official said. “The process will continue over the coming days through working groups to further address remaining issues and details.”
     
 
            Talks ended Sunday without a resolution, and with Hamas continuing to publicly suggest it would not agree to a proposal meant to bridge remaining differences. The group has insisted it will only agree to the plan previously backed by US President Joe Biden.
     
More on the process: On Thursday, the US and Egypt met with Israel to try to narrow remaining gaps and clarify issues in the text of bridging proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. The US and Egypt met again Friday to discuss and prepare for the high-level talks this weekend.
     
            Yesterday, Qatar and Egypt met with senior representatives of Hamas and went through each paragraph of the proposal in detail to identify any remaining issues or questions to clarify, the source said.
     
            The source did not get into details about the outstanding issues, but CNN has reported that the presence of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi corridor, a key strip of land along the border with Egypt, is among the key matters still in contention.
     
            The United States helped Israel track incoming Hezbollah attacks early Sunday morning, according to a US defense official, but the US was not involved in Israel’s strikes in Lebanon.
     
            The US has assets for intelligence-gathering and reconnaissance in the region, including destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and drones that can monitor the area. 
 
            The official stressed that the US was not part of Israel’s strikes on the paramilitary group.
     
        “We continue to closely monitor the situation and remain well-postured and ready to support the defense of Israel from attacks by Iran and any of its proxies,” the official said.
     
 
﻿US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has ordered two aircraft carrier strike groups to remain in the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln arrived in the Middle East last week, joining the USS Theodore Roosevelt. 
     
            Austin notified Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of the decision to leave the carrier groups in place during a call Sunday where they discussed the overnight strikes.
     
            The USS Wasp amphibious ready group is already in the Mediterranean Sea. Advanced F-22 fighter jets have also arrived in US Central Command in recent weeks.
     
This post has been updated with details about plans for the US aircraft carrier strike groups in the Middle East.
 
CNN’s Aileen Graef contributed to this report. 
 
            The Hamas delegation, which has now left negotiations in Cairo on Sunday, emphasized that it only wants to implement US President Joe Biden’s proposal for a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, which it agreed to on July 2.
     
            Hamas demanded that Israel “be bound by what was agreed upon on July 2, based on what was stated in Biden’s speech and the Security Council resolution,” Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said in a statement.
     
            Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Aqsa TV last Tuesday that Israel has “set new conditions for accepting the agreement and has retracted what it had previously agreed to.”
     
            According to Hamdan, those new conditions included Israeli troops repositioning in the Philadelphi corridor, a key strip of land along the border with Egypt, and non-Palestinian management of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.
     
            The Hamas negotiating delegation left Cairo Sunday evening local time after meeting with mediators for the renewed talks.
     
            In his statement, Al-Rishq stressed Hamas’ position that any agreement must include “a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the freedom of return of residents to their areas, relief and reconstruction, and a serious exchange deal.”
     
            Hezbollah’s attack on Israel has been completed, but further strikes could be carried out in the future, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a televised speech Sunday evening.
     
            Hezbollah launched its attack in retaliation for Israel’s assassination of its most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in late July. 
     
            Nasrallah said the militant group had delayed its response until Sunday to give “sufficient opportunity” for Gaza ceasefire negotiations to take place, to impose greater “mental and financial strain” inside Israel, and to ensure the attack’s success.
     
        “We have been ready. We delayed because the extent of the Israeli and American security alert by air and land and sea was high, so rushing into it could’ve led to failure,” Nasrallah said.
     
 
Details on the attack: Hezbollah’s plan was to launch 300 Soviet-era Katyusha rockets to occupy Israel’s defense systems, Nasrallah said.
     
            Fighters were instructed to target military infrastructure and avoid civilians, according to the Hezbollah chief. The two main targets were Israel’s Glilot Military Base and Ein Shemer Airfield, he said.
     
            Israel has said that during the flurry of rockets, Hezbollah also launched drones at targets in central Israel, but that its defenses were able to knock the uncrewed craft out of the sky.
     
            Nasrallah said Hezbollah would assess the attack’s results before determining whether they would launch further strikes.
     
Israel’s strikes in Lebanon: The Hezbollah chief said Israel began striking Lebanon about 30 minutes before Hezbollah’s operation began. The Israeli military deemed the attack “preemptive” and said it destroyed rocket launchers that would have been used to strike Israel.
     
        “What happened was aggression, not preemptive action,” Nasrallah said. 
     
 
            The militant group’s leader praised the “patience and courage” of people living in southern Lebanon, which was on the receiving end of much of Israel’s strikes. 
     
What Israel is saying: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated Sunday that the fighting may not be done. “This is not the end of the matter,” he said in a video message.
     
            Despite the two leaders’ rhetoric, it appears they have each backed away from the brink of a wider regional war for now.
     
            While Israel trades fire with Hezbollah at its northern border, it continues to wage war on another Islamist militant group, Hamas, in Gaza.
     
            Israel’s widespread bombing and ground campaign in the enclave after Hamas’ October 7 attacks, along with a tight siege on aid flowing into the territory, has led to a spiraling humanitarian crisis there.
     
            Hezbollah has said its recent attacks on Israel are in solidarity with Hamas and the Palestinians in Gaza.
     
Here’s what happened in the enclave Sunday:
 
Mass evacuation: Israel’s military told thousands more Palestinians sheltering in parts of Deir al Balah in central Gaza to evacuate.
     
        “The IDF will act forcefully against Hamas and the terrorist organizations in your area,” an Israeli military spokesperson said in a post on X. “For your own safety, evacuate immediately to the west. The area you are in is considered a dangerous combat zone.”
     
 
            Journalist Mohammad Al Sawalhi told CNN there are five school shelters in the area, known as block 128, along with tents and houses. Altogether, the area has approximately 40,000 people, many of whom already fled fighting in Rafah or elsewhere in the strip.
     
            It’s unclear how many people are currently aware of the evacuation order. Al Sawalhi told CNN that whoever had an internet connection took a screenshot of the post or SMS messages and circulated it on WhatsApp to others.
     
            CNN obtained a video showing the aftermath of a strike that hit an area near Al Aqsa Hospital just moments before the evacuation order came out.
     
Polio vaccine arrives: Polio vaccines for more than 1.2 million people have been delivered to the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian health ministry and the Israeli agency responsible for coordinating the delivery.
     
            Polio was detected in Gaza’s sewage water last month, meaning that thousands of Palestinians are now at risk of contracting the disease, which can cause paralysis. 
     
More Palestinians killed in airstrikes: The Ministry of Health in Gaza says at least 71 people were killed by Israeli military operations over the 24 hours preceding Sunday morning. Another 112 people have been wounded, according to the ministry.
     
            An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson denied that strikes launched by Hezbollah against the country overnight damaged Israeli military bases.
     
            “In contradiction of the claims by Hezbollah, there was no damage to IDF bases, not in the north and not in the center,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said earlier today that the militia’s flurry of strikes had mainly targeted Israel’s Glilot Military Base and Ein Shemer Airfield.
     
            Hagari said most of Hezbollah’s rockets and drones were intercepted or fell in open areas.
     
            Nasrallah has said the Islamist militant group will assess the damage it caused to Israeli assets before determining whether Hezbollah will launch further attacks in retaliation for the killing of its most senior military official last month. 
     
            The government of Jordan is warning that the heavy exchange of fire overnight between Israel and Lebanon could lead to a long-feared wider war in the Mideast involving Israel, Iran and its proxies.
     
        In a statement Sunday, the country’s foreign ministry stressed the need “to prevent further escalation and to unify efforts to de-escalate and protect the region from the risk of sliding into a regional war.”
     
 
            The ministry’s spokesperson, Ambassador Sufian Qudah, urged countries to observe United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for a series of de-escalating actions in southern Lebanon, where the Islamist paramilitary group is based.
     
            Gaza ceasefire and hostage talks in Cairo are continuing as planned today, a US official said, even as a major flare-up between Israel and Hezbollah deepened fears of a broader regional conflict.
     
        “The process is ongoing and they’ve been constructive,” the official said. 
     
 
            Hamas and Israel each sent negotiators to Egypt for the talks on Sunday.
     
            The negotiations have been slow-moving, and key sticking points remain.
     
            An Israeli naval soldier died after sustaining shrapnel wounds on Sunday as Israel traded fire with Hezbollah across its northern border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said.
     
            The soldier, 21-year-old David Moshe Ben Shitrit, was one of three people injured “either directly from an Iron Dome interceptor or from falling shrapnel from the interceptor” that hit his unit’s boat, an army official told CNN. The Iron Dome refers to Israel’s multi-layered, world-class air defense system.
     
            The official said these were preliminary findings and the soldier’s death is still under review.
     
            The Galilee Medical Center in northern Israel said it treated three young men with shrapnel injuries on Sunday morning, which were “a result of interception fragments in the Nahariya area.”
     
            The hospital described efforts to save a 21-year-old’s life, but said he was pronounced dead at the medical center.
     
First fatality: Shitrit is the first reported fatality on the Israeli side since Sunday’s major flare-up began.
     
            The Lebanese Ministry of Health said earlier that three people were killed in southern Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah also announced after the fighting Sunday that two of its militants had been killed, but it did not specify where they had died or if it had been in today’s strikes.
     
            European carriers have begun canceling flights to the Middle East in response to Sunday’s increased fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            French national carrier Air France has suspended all flights to Tel Aviv and the Lebanese capital of Beirut until “at least” Monday, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.
     
            The airline may prolong the cancellation. It has promised to provide an update on Monday.
     
            Meanwhile, British Airways has canceled all their flights in and out of Tel Aviv through Wednesday, a spokesperson for the airline said Sunday.
     
            “Safety is always our top priority, and we’re contacting customers to advise them of their travel options,” the spokesperson said.
     
This post has been updated with an additional airline.
 
            For nearly a month, people in Lebanon and Israel have braced for a wider war.
     
            On Sunday morning, Hezbollah delivered what it called the “first phase” of its anticipated response to the killing of a top commander last month, launching hundreds of drones and rockets toward Israel.
     
            Israel said it had preemptively struck Hezbollah targets overnight to prevent a much wider attack, saying it hit many rocket launchers in Lebanon.
     
            The cross-border fire Sunday morning marked a significant escalation after 11 months of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. But fears of a wider war appear to have been dampened, for now.
     
            In Israel, authorities soon lifted security restrictions in the country’s northernmost territory, known as the upper Galilee. In Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had concluded attacks on Israel for the day.
     
            This signals the resumption of the low-intensity conflict at the border. It also seems to mark the conclusion of an anticipated escalation from Hezbollah that brought the Middle East, once again, to the brink of all-out war.
     
            Hezbollah has said this was the “first phase” of its response but has been scant on the details of a follow-up. The phrase may be rhetorical — the group is prone to keeping its threats open-ended.
     
            Netanyahu made a similarly open-ended vow Sunday, saying, “This is not the end of the matter.”
     
            And even if Hezbollah’s promised response is largely out of the way, Israel must continue to wait for another threat to transpire: Iran’s vowed “revenge” for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which it blamed on Israel.

            Polio vaccines for more than 1.2 million people have been delivered to the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli agency responsible for coordinating the delivery.
     
            Polio was detected in Gaza’s sewage water last month, meaning that thousands of Palestinians are now at risk of contracting the disease, which can cause paralysis. 
     
            The 25,100 vials of the vaccine were delivered via the Kerem Shalom Crossing, near the border with Egypt, according to officials with Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT).
     
            The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah has confirmed the doses arrived in Gaza. It noted earlier Sunday that the necessary equipment was in place to keep the vaccines cold during transportation.
     
            COGAT said local and international medical teams would administer vaccines to unvaccinated children in Gaza “in the coming days” and would coordinate with the Israeli military to use “humanitarian pauses” allowing people to reach medical centers and get vaccinated.
     
            The Palestinian health ministry called on international organizations to pressure Israeli authorities to halt their military operations in Gaza, stressing that it is essential for medical teams to vaccinate children and stop the spread of the polio virus.
     
        “The Ministry is working around the clock to coordinate with international health partners to launch the campaign in the coming days, ensuring the safety of health care workers amid the ongoing aggression by the occupation on the Strip,” the ministry said in a statement. 
     
 
Remember: Israel’s widespread bombing and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks, along with a tight siege on aid flowing into the territory, has led to a spiraling humanitarian crisis in the enclave.
     
            Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas continues in Gaza as it battles another Islamist militant group, Hezbollah, to the north in Lebanon.
     
Correction: A previous version of this post misstated where the vaccines were taken en route to Gaza.
 
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message Sunday that the Israel Defense Forces had used its “intense preemptive attack” on Hezbollah sites in Lebanon overnight to destroy thousands of rockets “intended to harm our citizens and our forces.”
     
            Sunday’s flare-up in the long-running clashes between Israel and Hezbollah began when Israel carried out strikes against the Islamist militant group. Israel alleged that Hezbollah was preparing to launch a barrage of missiles and rockets at Israeli targets, a charge the group denies. 
     
            Netanyahu hinted that more fighting may be on the way, saying in his message that, “What happened today is not the end.”
     
        I repeat, this is not the end of the matter,” he said.
     
 
Drone intercepts: Drones launched by Hezbollah to attack a “strategic target” in central Israel were all intercepted by the country’s military, Netanyahu said in his message.
     
            He did not clarify what the target was.
     
            The Ministry of Health in Gaza says at least 71 people have been killed as a result of Israeli military operations in the enclave over the past 24 hours. 
     
            Another 112 people have been wounded, the ministry said Sunday.
     
            The ministry does not distinguish between civilian casualties and those sustained by Hamas, but it previously asserted that about 70% of casualties in the war have been women and children.
     
            The ministry said the cumulative toll from Israeli military operations in Gaza since October 7 is now at least 40,405 killed and 93,468 injured.
     
            Israel’s chief military spokesperson on Sunday said Hezbollah had intended to launch several hundred rockets at northern Israel and target the center of the country with drones. 
     
            The military has called its strikes on Hezbollah “preemptive.”
     
        “We removed a wider threat, probably also a future threat in some areas, with an emphasis on rockets to the north of the country,” the spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said. He added that Israel had thwarted “most of the attack” that Hezbollah had planned to carry out by attacking 40 areas of southern Lebanon.  
     
 
            The Israel Defense Forces targeted and destroyed hundreds of rocket launchers armed with thousands of launch pads, Hagari claimed.
     
            Speaking in Tel Aviv, Hagari said that the Home Front Command had decided to remove restrictions, including the limitation of gatherings, for most of northern Israel, except for the immediate border area with Lebanon and some settlements in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. 
     
            Negotiators are in the Egyptian capital Cairo for a renewed push to secure an end to fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages, the latest in a stuttering series of efforts to secure a deal between Israel and Hamas. 
     
            Heightened tensions between Israel and Iran have brought a fresh sense of urgency to bring the 10-month war to an end. Iran has been threatening to retaliate against Israel since a string of figures in Iran-backed militant groups were killed over a span of weeks, including the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
            Overnight, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah said it carried out the first phase of its retaliation for the killing of a top commander, but the strikes have not impacted talks.
     
Here’s what we know: 
 
What’s happening? Hamas representatives arrived in the Egyptian capital on Saturday evening, where negotiators from Israel, the US, Egypt and Qatar have been holding talks. The delegation will hear from mediators about the latest in the deal talks, Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said in a statement on Saturday. Israeli negotiators are also attending. 
     
What’s on the table? A three-phase peace plan was first laid out by US President Joe Biden in May, which sees a release of hostages combined with a “full and complete ceasefire.” The White House is pushing to get the deal across the line and has previously insisted the deal has been accepted by Israel, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says fundamental issues remain. 
     
What are the key sticking points? There remain significant gaps between the two sides. Israel has made it clear that following the initial six-week phase, a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire. Hamas has indicated it is unhappy with the latest proposal as it didn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions on the exchange of prisoners. Another major sticking point is the future of the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza. Israel has demanded maintaining control of the border zone, whereas Hamas has said Israeli troops must withdraw from the area.
     
Is a deal likely? The US has been optimistic about the latest phase in negotiations. Biden last week said “we are closer than we’ve ever been.” But the talks have been underway for months and it remains the case that there are major differences to overcome. Haniyeh played a pivotal role for Hamas in the talks, while Netanyahu is under competing pressures from families of hostages to secure a deal and from his cabinet to defeat Hamas. 
     
            Sunday morning in the Middle East began with a massive exchange of fire between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, escalating tensions between the sides which had spiked after the October 7 terror attack on Israel.
     
Here’s what’s happened so far: 
 
            The Israeli military said Hezbollah was planning a “wide attack” on targets in both northern and central Israel, but was unsuccessful, spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said. 
     
            Hezbollah was “targeting mostly the north, but they also had a few targets in central Israel that they were not able to carry out with our self defense operation this morning,” Shoshani said.
     
            Israel said it carried out preemptive strikes on Hezbollah to thwart a major attack. The Shia militant group, meanwhile, said its operation so far had been a “complete success.” 
 
Israeli strikes in Lebanon: Shoshani said the Israel Defense Forces were focused on areas in southern Lebanon where there’s a “large concentration of rocket launchers.”
     
            At least three people were killed in the strikes, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health said in a statement.
 
No bases appear hit: The Israeli military said it is unaware of any impacts on military bases or targets in central Israel following the strikes. The Israeli Defense Forces told CNN that “very little damage was sustained” due to the rocket attack. 
     
            In northern Israel, images show some damage to homes in the municipality of Acre. 
     
            Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. 
     
            Backed by Iran and based in Lebanon, the Shia Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8.
     
            Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel and its allies in the region.
     
            In the event of a major flare-up, Israel would also have to contend with Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The group is part of an Iran-led axis of militants spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq. Some of these groups have increased coordination significantly since October, when Israel launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked the country. This axis is known in Israel as the “ring of fire.”
     
            Throughout its decades-long conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has been engaged in asymmetric warfare. It has sought to grow its political and military might, while seeking to establish deterrence despite Israel’s military superiority.
     
            But Hezbollah threads the needle carefully. Provoking Israel’s full firepower could significantly degrade the group’s capabilities, setting it back years – if not decades – and destroying large parts of Lebanon, which has buckled under the weight of its years-long financial crisis.
     
            Hezbollah’s chances of survival in an all-out war with Israel hinged on whether or not it could outsmart these systems, which have, in recent months, intercepted thousands of airborne weapons from Iran, Gaza, and Lebanon.
     
See our visual guide to Hezbollah’s weapons.
 
            Israeli President Isaac Herzog said that Israeli strikes on Lebanon early Sunday “epitomized” the country’s right to self-defense.
     
        ‪”The decisive action we witnessed early this morning epitomizes Israel’s right and duty to defend itself and its citizens against the threat of terrorism,” Herzog wrote on X. He also thanked Israelis serving in the country’s military.
     
 
            Herzog’s statement followed the Israeli military launching preemptive strikes against what it said were “terror targets in Lebanon” after it claimed to have identified Hezbollah “preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.”
     
            The Islamist militant group called the accusations “baseless.” Hezbollah responded with strikes of its own, which it said was the “first phase” of its response to Israel. Hezbollah called the salvo a “complete success.”
     
            Israeli strikes on Lebanon continued on Sunday, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency, which reported multiple airstrikes in villages around the town of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon.
     
            It also said that Israeli warplanes were flying over the western and central areas of southern Lebanon, as far north as the Litani River, some 20 kilometers from Israel’s northern border.
     
            Israel has confirmed carrying out further strikes, saying it struck a terrorist cell and rocket launchers across southern Lebanon. 
     
            The two UN agencies that work extensively in southern Lebanon – UNIFIL and UNSCOL – issued a statement Sunday saying: “In light of worrying developments across the Blue Line since the early morning, UNSCOL and UNIFIL call on all to cease fire and refrain from further escalatory action.” 
     
            The “Blue Line” is a demarcation line set by the United Nations in 2000 after Israel withdrew its military from southern Lebanon.
     
        “A return to the cessation of hostilities… Is the only sustainable way forward,” the agencies said.
     
 
            Tel Aviv has closed its beaches and cultural institutions after the early morning exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the municipality’s spokesperson said on Sunday.
     
            The city is also barring residents from engaging in large-scale official leisure activities due to the security situation. 
     
            The spokesperson reiterated that the city’s 240 bomb shelters are ready for use – though residents were advised not to stay in them unless they hear sirens or receive explicit instructions to do so.
     
Delays at Ben Gurion: There are also long delays as well as cancellations at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport following the fighting. 
     
            The departure and arrivals boards at the show delays of between two and seven hours in addition to many cancellations.
     
            A spokeswoman for the Israel Airport Authority told CNN that all flights that had been delayed in the early hours of Sunday were now able to leave but that it was “up to each airline to schedule and decide if they are flying today or not.”
     
            Negotiators are gathering in the Egyptian capital Cairo for a renewed push to secure an end for fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages.
     
            A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo Saturday evening, a Hamas official said, while an Israeli delegation is also expected to head there for the talks.
     
            There are still several sticking points over the potential three-phase agreement first put forward by US President Joe Biden. 
     
            Hamas has indicated they are unhappy with the latest proposal as it didn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions on the exchange of prisoners, among other issues.
     
            Meanwhile, Israel has made it clear that following the initial six-week phase, a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire.
     
            Three people have been killed in Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, according to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Health. 
     
            The full extent of the damage following a major exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah is yet to emerge, but two people were killed in the village of At Tiri in Nabatiyeh, and another was killed after an Israeli strike targeted a car in the town of Khiam, the ministry statement said. 
     
            The Amal Movement, a Hezbollah-allied Shia group, said in a statement that one of its fighters was killed “while performing his national and jihad duty in defense of Lebanon and the south.”
     
            Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah will deliver a speech today at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) on the latest developments, according to Hezbollah-run Al Manar TV agency. 
     
            Israel’s military said it launched “preemptive strikes” against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon after identifying that the militant group was preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. Shortly after that attack began, Hezbollah said it launched strikes toward Israel in retaliation for the killing of a top military commander last month. 
     
            The Israeli military and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire for months. But the latest strikes mark a serious escalation in tensions and come as fears mount that a potential major escalation of fighting in the Middle East could tip the region into all-out conflict.
     
            Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “determined to do everything to protect our country,” in a meeting with his security cabinet Sunday, where the prime minister vowed to “uphold a simple rule: whoever hurts us — we hurt him.”
     
        “This morning we detected Hezbollah’s preparations to attack Israel. Together with the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff, we instructed the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) to act proactively to remove the threat,” he said.  
     
 
            Netanyahu added the IDF had since “been acting vigorously to thwart the threats” and said the forces “destroyed thousands of rockets aimed at the north of the country.”
     
            Before launching its attack on Hezbollah, Israel said Saturday that its military was prepared for any possible retaliatory attacks by the Iran-backed militant group over the killing of one of its top commanders.
     
            Both Hezbollah and Iran have been threatening to retaliate against Israel since a string of figures in Iran-backed militant groups were killed over a span of weeks. Those killings late last month included the death of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
            Asked about the threats of retaliation, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters Saturday that the military was prepared for any possible attack by either Hezbollah or Iran.
     
        “We take our enemies’ threats seriously and we’ve been ready for a long period. We’re highly prepared both in the offense and defense, but above all, any threat toward the citizens of Israel we identify, we eliminate, and that’s how we’ll continue. Any development that will be, we’ll update the public immediately,” Hagari said.
     
 
            Hagari was then pressed by a reporter from Israel’s state-run Kan 11 television channel, who said there were situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon. The IDF spokesperson did not say whether he was familiar with those assessments, nor did he indicate when an attack might be expected.
     
            Hezbollah has criticized Israel’s description of its strike as “preemptive,” calling them “baseless claims” that “contradict the facts on the ground.” 
     
            The group said Israel’s claims would be refuted in a speech by its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the timing of which will be determined today.  
     
            The Israeli military had said earlier that it carried out strikes against Hezbollah targets “in a self-defense act” to remove threats it had identified. 
     
This post has been updated to correct the timing of Nasrallah’s speech.
 
            An Israeli delegation is expected to head to Cairo for ceasefire and hostage release negotiations that are due to resume today, an Israeli official told CNN.
     
            A Hamas delegation was planning to travel to Cairo yesterday to hear from mediators about the latest in the talks, Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said Saturday.
     
            Several sticking points remain in the talks over a potential three-phase agreement as senior negotiators are expected to meet this weekend, and concerns have risen in recent weeks that efforts to reach a deal could be impacted by any broadening of the regional conflict.
     
            Hamas’ al-Rishq reiterated that the group desires to enact the three-phase proposal introduced by US President Joe Biden, which would include the release of hostages from Gaza, a “full and complete ceasefire,” and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. 
     
            But Hamas has publicly indicated they are unhappy with the latest proposal as it didn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions on the exchange of prisoners, among other issues.
     
            Israel has made it clear that following the proposed initial six-week phase, a break in the fighting may be just that, and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire.
     
            An Egyptian official familiar with the negotiations told CNN there are “still wide” differences before an agreement can be reached.
     
            Egypt wants to see Israel “withdrawing its troops completely” from the Philadelphi corridor, an 8.7-mile strip of land in southern Gaza bordering Egypt currently controlled by Israeli forces, the official said. 
     
Some context: In May, Biden laid out a three-phase proposal the administration said was submitted by Israel that would pair a release of hostages from Gaza with a “full and complete ceasefire” and a release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. 
     
            The Israeli military says that about 100 of its fighter jets “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels, aimed for immediate fire toward northern and central Israel.”
     
            “More than 40 launch areas in Lebanon were struck during the strikes,” it said.
     
            Hezbollah has yet to comment on the claim.
     
            Lebanese state media NNA reported one person was killed in the strikes and that there was damage to crops and infrastructure.
     
        NNA called the Israeli strikes early on Sunday “the most violent since the beginning of the war,” saying that “starting from 4 am, the hostile airstrikes did not cease targeting the southern towns.”
     
 
            Areas in and around Qabrikha, Tulin, Wadi Saluki, Houla, Aadichit Al Qusayr, Deir Mimas, Talloussa and Bani Haiyyan, were struck, NNA said. 
     
            Earlier, NNA reported that “enemy warplanes” conducted strikes on the outskirts of the towns of Zibqin, Tayr Harfa, and Chama, causing severe damage to crop and local infrastructure, especially water and electricity networks. 
     
            It reported that Israeli warplanes and reconnaissance aircraft flew over the villages of Tyre and Bint Jbeil throughout the early morning hours. 
     
            Hezbollah said the “first phase” of its strikes against Israel “has ended with complete success.” 
     
            The militant group said this phase focused on targeting Israeli military sites that would prevent Israel from intercepting a second barrage of drone attacks that is aimed at a “desired target deep inside the entity,” without specifying what that target is. 
     
            Hezbollah then listed several locations it says it targeted successfully on Sunday, adding that it launched 320 rockets toward Israel, and that the drones entered successfully.
     
            Hezbollah had earlier said the strikes were in response to the killing of top military commander Fu’ad Shukr and others last month.
     
            When asked about the number of strikes by Hezbollah and the locations they were targeting, the Israeli military said their count so far is approximately 215 rockets launched from Lebanon — but that they cannot currently say where they’d hit. 
     
Some context: Israel said in a statement on July 30 that it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold.
     
            Israel said it served as retaliation for a deadly strike in the Israeli-occupied town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. Hezbollah denied the claim.
     
            Hezbollah said on Sunday they’re carrying out strikes towards Israel in response to the killing of top military commander Fu’ad Shukr last month as well as others killed in the same strike, “including women and children.”
     
            The group also said it’s carrying out the attacks on the day of Arbaeen, during which Shia Muslims mark the end of a 40-day mourning period that begins with Ashura, which commemorates the martyrdom of Hussain ibn Ali.
     
Israel said in a statement on July 30 that it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold.
     
            Hezbollah added in a statement that it is “at the highest level of readiness and will stand strong and alert” to any Israeli “transgression or aggression,” especially if civilians are harmed “the punishment will be very severe and harsh.”
     
            US President Joe Biden is closely monitoring events in Israel and Lebanon, the White House said Saturday night.
     
        “He has been engaged with his national security team throughout the evening. At his direction, senior US officials have been communicating continuously with their Israeli counterparts. We will keep supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability,” NSC spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement.
     
 
            Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant had briefed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Saturday evening in the US. 
     
        “We have conducted precise strikes in Lebanon in order to thwart an imminent threat against the citizens of Israel,” Gallant told Austin according to a statement from the Ministry of Defense.
     
 
            Gallant added that Israel is prepared to deploy offensive and defensive means and thanked Austin for the ongoing cooperation.
     
            A Pentagon spokesperson on Saturday night said the US continues to closely monitor the situation and is “postured to support the defense of Israel.”
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene a security cabinet meeting soon to discuss the situation in northern Israel.
     
            The meeting comes as rockets from Lebanon have been fired into Israel after the Israeli military conducted strikes in southern Lebanon in the early hours of Sunday.
     
            The Israeli military said there were approximately 200 launches from Lebanon towards Israel, with no reports of injuries at this point.
     
            Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant has declared a “‘special situation on the home front’ across the country,” which enables the Israeli military to issue instructions to citizens, “including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant.”
     
            Some cities and towns in northern Israel have sent out directives to residents.
     
            The Municipality of Acre has directed residents to stay near shelters and reduce traffic. In the nearby city of Haifa, shelters have been opened, according to the municipality spokesperson.
     
            The Israeli military is striking what it says are “terror targets in Lebanon” after it had identified Hezbollah “preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.”
     
            “A short while ago, the IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory,” Israel Defense Force spokesperson Daniel Hagari said early Sunday local time.
     
            ‎‏”In a self-defense act to remove these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon, from which Hezbollah was planning to launch their attacks on Israeli civilians,” Hagari added.
     
            The IDF said approximately 200 rockets had been launched from Lebanon towards Israel early Sunday.
     
            The Israeli military and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire for months.
     
            Israel and Hezbollah have been effectively at war for decades, but the latest hostilities have been growing since Hamas’ deadly October 7 attacks on Israel. 
     
            Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander in July, who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children, marked the most significant series of escalations since October 7. 
     
Powerful paramilitary group: Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement based in Lebanon with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East.
     
            The Shiite “resistance” group, which emerged out of Israel’s devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, is tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. 
     
            Israel occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years before it was driven out by Hezbollah. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
     
            Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, with tensions boiling over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon again after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers.
     
            Hezbollah and Hamas have not always seen eye to eye, but they both support Palestinians and oppose Israel.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel’s defenses if an all-out war breaks out.

            The US decision to send warships and fighter squadron to the Middle East will mark perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting.
     
            The region is bracing for an Iranian retaliation after the country’s supreme leader vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this week. Israel has not commented on the killing. 
     
            US officials said the anticipated Iranian attack could occur in the coming days, and the US is closely watching the region for any indications of how it might play out. Officials said the attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones Iran launched against Israel in April, but it could also be larger and more complex, coordinated with Iranian proxies in the region. 
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of the Iran-backed group’s top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. 
     
            “Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday.
     
            The United States is sending a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation to the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Tehran earlier this week.
     
            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group, which is currently operating in the Gulf of Oman, according to a statement from deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.
     
            Destroyers and cruisers capable of ballistic missile defense will also be sent to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea. The statement does not say which warships have been sent, but two US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took part in intercepting the barrage of strikes Iran launched against Israel in April.
     
            Austin also ordered the deployment of a fighter squadron to the region, Singh said.
     
            The US already has the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship in the region, which operates with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, capable of carrying out an evacuation of US citizens in Lebanon should it be ordered.
     
            Iran has vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has not commented on the killing.
     
            Dutch airline KLM is canceling its planned flights to Tel Aviv until at least October in response to the “security situation the region,” a press officer for KLM said in a statement to CNN.
     
            The airline previously announced it was canceling flights into the Israeli capital until August 31.
     
            KLM joins a growing list of international airlines suspending flights into and out of the Middle East. United, Delta, Lufthansa and ITA Airways have all announced flight cancelations over the last week, citing security concerns.
     
            The Israeli Prime Minister’s office denied a report on Israel’s Channel 12 Friday that claimed there was an argument between Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s top security officials over negotiations for a hostage and ceasefire deal on Wednesday.
     
            Channel 12 reported that at a tense meeting of Israel’s security council on Wednesday night, senior officials had urged Netanyahu to take a hostage and ceasefire deal. 
     
            The report claimed that Mossad Director David Barnea said, “There is a deal ready and that Israel must take it.” The news agency also reported Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet, had said it appeared to him that the prime minister did not want the outline of the deal on the table.
     
            Netanyahu had banged on the table and said the team didn’t “know how to conduct negotiations,” the report added. 
     
            Channel 12 did not cite its sources, and CNN has not independently confirmed the reporting.
     
            The prime minister’s office immediately denied the story, saying, “The report is incorrect,” according to a statement. 
     
        “The head of the Mossad did not say that there was a deal ready and that it should be accepted. The description that Hamas supposedly agreed to the terms of the deal is false … All the demands that Israel insists on are in accordance with the 27.5 outline. Contrary to what was claimed, the Prime Minister did not add anything to them, while Hamas is the one who demanded dozens of changes to the outline,” the statement said.
     
 
            Netanyahu was committed to securing the hostages’ release and had told negotiators to leave for Cairo this weekend, his office added.
     
            CNN previously reported that Netanyahu was adding 11th-hour demands to Israel’s most recent response to the ceasefire negotiations, including reneging on previous Israeli concessions.
     
Funeral prayers were held for Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh before he was buried Friday in Doha, Qatar. He was killed in an overnight strike in Tehran earlier this week.
     
            He is the third high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups in the Middle East to be killed in recent weeks, raising fears that Israel’s war with the Palestinian militant group in Gaza could spiral into a fully-fledged Middle East conflict.
     
            Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death, an assassination that Iran blamed on Israel. According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied a role in Haniyeh’s death.
     
Here’s what else you need to know:
 
Hamas called for the “day of rage” to coincide with Haniyeh’s burial: “We call for prayers today, Friday, for the soul of the Mujahid leader Ismail Haniyeh, in all mosques in the world. ⁠Let Friday be a day of overwhelming anger in condemnation of the assassination and rejection of the genocide in the Gaza Strip,” a statement from the Palestinian militant group said.
     
Israelis brace for attacks amid tensions: Israelis have been provided with guidance on what to do in the event of attacks on the country, while supermarkets are reporting a spike in sales for basic goods. The Jerusalem municipality distributed a file with a list of parking lots that will be used as shelters and a list of bomb shelters. It said residents must be able to reach bomb shelters in 90 seconds. Residents are also advised to stock enough water and food for three days and to buy batteries and flashlights in addition to medications.
     
US response to Iran: The United States is ready to move resources to the Middle East if needed, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said. Noting Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei’s statement about avenging Haniyeh’s death, Kirby said the US has to “make sure we’ve got the right resources and capabilities in the region.” Kirby said Friday that that support would likely come in the form of both personnel and hardware in the region.
     
Flight disruptions: There have been disruptions to flights in and out of Israel. Air India is the international carrier to suspend services to Tel Aviv. Other carriers that have suspended flights, including Italian flag carrier ITA Airways and American carriers United and Delta. Germany’s Lufthansa Group extended flight suspensions to Lebanon’s capital Beirut until at least Monday.
     
Israel forces detain an Imam of Al-Aqsa Mosque: Sheikh Ikrima Sabri was detained at his house in East Jerusalem for interrogation. This happened hours after Sabri briefly made a prayer during Friday’s sermon that God accept Haniyeh as a “martyr” and announced an absentee funeral prayer for him and others who have been killed will be held after the sermon, which did not involve any calls for violence. The word “martyr” has been frequently used to refer to Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and was used in the same sermon in reference to killed Palestinians. Sabri did not violate any laws and there’s no reason for his detention legally, his lawyer said, adding that this is “political persecution.”
     
Projectiles from southern Gaza: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday that a projectile fired from southern Gaza fell in an open area near the Israeli town of Kiryat Malakhi, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the enclave. There are no reports of casualties or damage. The launch of rockets from Gaza has become less frequent in recent months, and very few have traveled such a great distance. IDF also said Hezbollah on Friday tried to launch rockets toward Arab al-Aramashe, an Israeli village close to the Lebanese border, but that the rockets did not cross into Israel.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will direct “multiple force posture moves” in the Middle East ahead of a possible attack by Iran on Israel, according to the Pentagon.
     
            Austin spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday and “informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and future defense force posture changes that the department will take to support the defense of Israel,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.
     
        “The secretary will be directing multiple forthcoming force posture moves to bolster force protection for US forces regionwide, to provide elevated support to the defense of Israel, and to ensure that the United States is prepared to respond to this evolving crisis,” Singh added.
     
 
            Singh declined to detail the potential moves, saying that Austin would be directing those moves “at a later time.” But the US has a number of naval assets already in the region, including a carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman and amphibious assault ships and destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean. 
     
            A US official separately told CNN that the additional capabilities would likely include more air defense systems to help protect Israel and US forces from a potential Iranian attack. 
     
            Singh noted that there “could be additional” US troops that enter the region to help bolster US forces there but declined to outline specific capabilities or units that may be deployed. 
     
            CNN reported on Thursday the Pentagon discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region. The officials said an Iranian response could occur in the coming days.
     
            The body of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran, was buried in Qatar on Friday after a funeral procession that was attended by thousands in Doha.
     
            A video by Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency shows the burial of Haniyeh, which was attended by a relatively small number of people, including Iranian officials.
     
            The video also shows Hamas’ senior leader, Khaled Meshaal, in attendance.
     
            A relief worker has warned that Palestinians in Gaza are trapped in a cycle of repeated displacement, siege and dire living conditions amid the Israeli offensive. 
     
            “I’ve never seen so many compounding horrors as I’ve seen in Gaza,” said Liz Allcock, the head of protection at the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP). 
     
        “It’s not just poor living conditions, it’s also the constant threat to life, the repeated forced displacement, the constant siege, and the list goes on,” she added. “People are trying to survive in places that have been totally decimated by the Israeli military.” 
     
 
            Her testimony was shared with CNN by MAP, after her recent deployment to the ravaged strip. 
     
            Three-hundred days of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza has obliterated entire neighborhoods, wiped out families and deepened a humanitarian crisis. At least 1.9 million Palestinians – almost the entire population – have been displaced, according to the UN. In July, the UN warned of widespread famine across the strip, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians. 
     
            Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a Palestinian displaced in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, told CNN that the past nine months have been engulfed by “fear and terror.” 
     
            “This situation has become very dangerous, as hundreds of children die every day,” the 19-year-old said on Friday.  
     
            “My message to CNN readers is that they do not become accustomed to scenes of crimes and the scenes of children’s body parts,” she added. “Convey our voice to the world.” 
     
            Israel forces have detained the Imam of Al-Aqsa Mosque and former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Sheikh Ikrima Sabri at his house in East Jerusalem for interrogation — hours after he mourned Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh during Friday prayer. 
     
        “[Sabri] was taken from his home for questioning by the Israeli police, and now he is being interrogated,” the Israeli Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir said in a statement.
     
 
            One of Sabri’s lawyers, Khalid Zabarqeh, told CNN the 85-year-old did not violate any laws in his sermon. “Legally, there is no reason for his detention,” he said, adding this is a “political persecution.”
     
            Sabri’s detention came after Israeli Minister of Interior Moshe Arbel called to revoke his residency in a letter to the attorney general on Friday, arguing he “does not identify with the state [of Israel] and its citizens, but on the contrary, seeks to destroy them.”
     
            The Israeli police also issued a statement saying it is opening an investigation following the Friday prayer to “determine whether there is a suspicion of incitement against the relevant authorities.” Ben Gvir welcomed the investigation and described Sabri’s speech as “inflammatory.”
     
Some context: During Friday’s sermon, Sabri briefly made a prayer that God accept Ismail Haniyeh as a “martyr” and announced an absentee funeral prayer for him and others who have been killed will be held after the sermon, which did not involve any calls for violence.
     
            The word “martyr” has been frequently used to refer to Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and was used in the same sermon in reference to killed Palestinians.
     
            UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, called for de-escalation in the Middle East after Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on Wednesday.
     
        “In recent days, I have engaged in critical discussions with the relevant parties and member states in the region, including Lebanon, Egypt, and Qatar, in support of regional de-escalation,” Wennesland said on Friday.  “I underscored the urgency of addressing the growing risk of a serious escalation, which poses a substantial threat to regional stability. We examined the ongoing efforts to mediate and de-escalate the situation and explored ways to prevent a spillover of the conflict,” Wennesland added.
     
 
            Wennesland called for more effort to prevent any “further deterioration of the situation.”
     
            He said it is “crucial that we act decisively and collectively to address the immediate threats and lay the groundwork for a lasting peace,” adding “I will continue my active engagement with all the relevant parties to support peace and stability in the region.” 
     
Some context: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge the death in Tehran of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, an assassination that Iran blamed on Israel. According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied a role in Haniyeh’s death.
     
            A Palestinian doctor in Gaza recounted scenes of patients dying in his arms and desperate civilians seeking refuge in hospital corridors, after 300 days of Israel’s offensive in the enclave. 
     
            “What we are currently facing is like the horrors of judgement day,” said Dr. Mohammed Mohsen, a doctor in the intensive care unit of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza. “Simple cases pass away in your arms because there is no space or no basic medical supplies.”
     
            “I know that my family members or loved ones could be the next patients I have to treat,” he added. 
     
            Mohsen’s testimony was shared with CNN by the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians.  
     
            Israel’s bombardment and siege of Gaza has paralyzed the medical system, in the face of a relentless bombing campaign that has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 885 health workers, the ministry reported. Only 14 out of 36 hospitals remain partially operational.
     
            Mohsen warned he is “exhausted and burned out,” as he struggles to balance shifts that last for more than 60 hours – while caring for his mother, a chronic kidney disease patient, and his father, who is recovering from a stroke. 
     
        “Please don’t stop talking about us, about our stories. We need this war to stop. We are human beings and we need to live in peace,” he said. “When we see you talking about us this gives us some release… At least if we passed away, we would not be anonymous.” 
     
 
            French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has asked police to reinforce security for the Jewish community amid an escalation in tensions in the Middle East and Hamas’ announcement of a “day of rage.”
     
            In a memo, Darmanin says there’s a “real risk of someone taking action,” especially given the presence of “a number of Israeli nationals” on French soil during the Paris Olympics. 
     
            Hamas called for the “day of rage” to coincide with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s burial on Friday. 
     
        “We call for prayers today, Friday, for the soul of the Mujahid leader Ismail Haniyeh, in all mosques in the world. ⁠Let Friday be a day of overwhelming anger in condemnation of the assassination and rejection of the genocide in the Gaza Strip,” a statement from the Palestinian militant group said.
     
 
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday that a projectile fired from southern Gaza fell in an open area near the Israeli town of Kiryat Malakhi, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the enclave.
     
            There are no reports of casualties or damage.
     
            The launch of rockets from Gaza has become less frequent in recent months, and very few have travelled such a great distance.
     
            French visitors who still happen to be in Iran should “leave as soon as possible” because of the heightened risk of military escalation in the region, the foreign ministry said Friday.  
     
            The statement reiterated that the whole of Iran “is marked as red on the travel advisory map”, meaning “French nationals are strongly advised not to travel to Iran for any reason whatsoever.”
     
            The warning comes amid heightened tensions and fears of retaliatory strikes between Iran and Israel. 
     
            Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge the death in Tehran of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, an assassination that Iran blamed on Israel. 
     
            According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied a role in Haniyeh’s death.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say Hezbollah on Friday tried to launch rockets toward Arab al-Aramashe, an Israeli village close to the Lebanese border, but that the rockets did not cross into Israel.
     
        “Shortly afterward, the IDF identified the terrorist who fired the rockets in the area of Wadi Hamoul, and the IAF [Israel Air Force] swiftly struck the terrorist,” it said.
     
 
            “Over the past few hours, numerous launches were identified crossing from Lebanese territory, most of which fell in open areas. No injuries were reported. IDF artillery struck the sources of fire,” the IDF said.
     
            After several days of relative calm, the IDF on Thursday said several dozen rockets were fired toward Israel from southern Lebanon. No casualties were reported.
     
            A funeral was held for Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar on Friday, as mosques across several countries hosted commemoration ceremonies for the assassinated leader.
     
            Haniyeh’s coffin was placed in a mosque in the Qatari capital Doha for his funeral prayer on Friday, a day after a large procession led by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei drew thousands in Tehran.
     
            Hamas deputy leader Khalil Al-Hayya led the funeral ceremony which was held after Muslim Friday prayers. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani were in attendance.
     
            After funeral prayers, worshippers, some carrying Palestinian flags, chanted against Israel and in support of Palestinians, according to a video on Reuters.
     
            Haniyeh is expected to be buried later in Lusail, Hamas said this week.
     
            Funeral prayers were held in mosques of Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan and Yemen for Haniyeh, videos showed.
     
            After Iran vowed retaliation for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh earlier this week, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said the United States is ready to move resources to the Middle East if needed.
     
        “[The US] is always reevaluating our force posture in the Middle East to make sure that we’ve got what we need to defend ourselves, our troops, our facilities – but also our allies and partners, such as Israel,” Kirby told CNN on Friday.
     
 
            But he added: “I don’t think it’d be good for me to get into too much detail on that.”
     
            Kirby’s remarks came after Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei sent a warning to Israel, following Haniyeh’s death in Tehran. “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Khamenei said on Wednesday.
     
            “We’ve heard the supreme leader loud and clear that he intends to avenge this killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran, and that they want to conduct another attack on Israel,” Kirby said. “We’ve got to make sure we’ve got the right resources and capabilities in the region.”
     
            On a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, the White House said President Joe Biden “reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.”
     
            Kirby said Friday that that support would likely come in the form of both personnel and hardware in the region.
     
            A decision by the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv to fly its flag half-staff as part of Turkey’s national day of mourning for Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh has left members of the Israeli government and public enraged. 
     
            Foreign Minister Israel Katz summoned Turkey’s deputy ambassador for a “stern reprimand” after the move, saying Israel “will not accept expressions of sympathy for a murderer like Ismail Haniyeh.“
     
        “If the embassy representatives want to mourn, they should do so in Turkey with their master Erdogan, who supports the terrorist organization Hamas and its acts of murder and horror,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.  
     
 
            The Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for the expulsion of the ambassador, saying Turkey’s lowering of the flag as a “tribute” to Haniyeh “shows exactly what they think of us.” 
     
            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday will be a national day of mourning for Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran this week. The Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan travelled to Qatar’s capital Doha for Haniyeh’s funeral. 
     
            Israel has neither claimed or denied responsibility for the assassination. 
     
            Turkey and Israel have been embroiled in a war of words since October 7 with both countries regularly trading insults in public statements. 
     
            Amid heightening regional tensions, Israelis have been provided with guidance on what to do in the event of attacks on the country, while supermarkets are reporting a spike in sales for basic goods. 
     
            Israel’s Victory supermarket chain said sales of some goods are up 30%, compared to regular sales. It told CNN that people mostly buy canned food, cereals, pasta, toilet paper, frozen meat, bottled water and hygiene wipes. 
     
            The Jerusalem municipality has issued instructions to people on what to do in the event of the city coming under attack, distributing a file with a list of parking lots that will be used as shelters and a list of bomb shelters. It said residents must be able to reach bomb shelters in 90 seconds. 
     
        “Residents are advised to clean and prepare their bomb shelters in advance,” the file says. 
     
 
            Residents are also advised to stock enough water and food for three days and to buy batteries and flashlights in addition to medications.
     
        “Residents should be ready for power cuts that might last several days. They should also be ready to stay in bomb shelters for several days,” the file says.
     
 
            There have also been disruptions to flights in and out of Israel, with Air India becoming the latest international carrier to suspend services to Tel Aviv. 
     
Some context: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge the death in Tehran of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, an assassination that Iran blamed on Israel. According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied a role in Haniyeh’s death.
     
            An Israeli airstrike has killed four relatives of social media personalities Awad and Hayma Barbakh, according to the Gaza Civil Defense.
     
            Awad and Hayma Barbakh have become well-known on YouTube and TikTok throughout the war in Gaza for making funny videos about their situation, including Awad’s trademark scream, that have attracted millions of views.
     
            They have used their income to set up a street kitchen and provide displaced families with cash.
     
            The Friday strike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza killed four of their cousins. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) refused to give further comment to a string of CNN questions regarding the killings of Al Jazeera journalists Ismail Al-Ghoul and Rami Al-Rifi. 
     
        In a statement to CNN, the IDF and Israeli Security Agency claimed that Al-Ghoul was a “Nukhba [Hamas unit] terrorist who participated in the October 7th massacre and was responsible for the recording and publication of attacks against IDF troops.”
     
 
            CNN has asked the IDF for evidence of the allegations made against Al-Ghoul. In a series of questions sent to the IDF on Thursday, CNN noted that Ismail al-Ghoul had been arrested on March 18 in northern Gaza and then released 12 hours later and asked why he had been freed if he was a suspected operative of the Al Qassam Brigades — Hamas’ military wing.
     
            CNN also asked whether the IDF regarded Al-Ghoul as actively engaged in combat and whether Al-Rifi was also a member of the wing.
     
            The IDF said it had nothing to add to its statement.
     
Remember: Al-Ghoul and cameraman Al-Rifi, who lived in the besieged enclave, were killed in an airstrike on their car in the al Shati refugee camp, according to the Qatar-based network. 
     
            The journalists, both aged 27, were reporting live for much of the day from a location close to the family home of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital of Tehran this week.
     
            Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says it is outraged by the killing of Al Jazeera journalists Ismail Al-Ghoul and Rami Al-Rifi in Gaza.
     
        “We are appalled by this violent attack on two prominent Al Jazeera journalists – the latest incident in nearly 10 months of crimes against journalists in Gaza, where more than 120 journalists have now lost their lives,” RSF said.“RSF urges the Israeli government to immediately commit to ending the violence against journalists that continues to be mercilessly committed by Israeli Defence Forces, constituting flagrant examples of war crimes,” said Rebecca Vincent, RSF’s Director of Campaigns.
     
 
            RSF said that with the killing of Al-Ghoul and Al-Rifi, the number of Al Jazeera journalists killed in Gaza has risen to five, all targeted by direct strikes.
     
            The Israeli military said Thursday that Al-Ghoul was a member of Hamas’ military wing and had participated in the attack on Israel on October 7.
     
            A senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant has been killed in Gaza, Israel’s military said Friday.
     
            The IDF named him as Mohammed al-Jabari, the group’s deputy head of weapons manufacturing, saying he was active in northern Gaza. 
     
            Additionally, the IDF said it killed about 30 militants in close fighting and aerial strikes in  Rafah, southern Gaza.
     
            Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday called for prayers for its political chief Ismail Haniyeh and a “day of anger” over his killing and the war in Gaza ahead of his funeral in Qatar.
     
            Haniyeh was assassinated Tuesday night in Tehran using a hidden explosive device, a source told CNN, becoming the third high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups to be killed in recent weeks. 
     
            His killing has raised fears that Israel’s war with Hamas and its Iran-backed allies could ramp up into a fully-fledged Middle East conflict after Tehran vowed retaliation.
     
        “We call for prayers today, Friday, for the soul of the Mujahid leader Ismail Haniyeh, in all mosques in the world,” Hamas said in a statement. ”⁠Let Friday be a day of overwhelming anger in condemnation of the assassination and rejection of the genocide in the Gaza Strip.”
     
 
            Iran and Hamas have blamed Haniyeh’s assassination on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in his killing. 
 
            ITA Airways has temporarily suspended flights serving Tel Aviv, it said in post on X Friday. 
     
            The Italian flag carrier joins several airlines, including United and Delta, that have canceled services to and from Israel in recent days over security concerns.
     
        “Due to the geopolitical developments in the Middle East and to ensure the safety of its passengers and crews, ITA Airways has decided to suspend flights to and from Tel Aviv from today, August 1, until August 6 included,” the post read, adding the situation was “constantly evolving.”
     
 
            The airline advised passengers to check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport.
     
            On Monday, Germany’s Lufthansa Group extended flight suspensions to Lebanon’s capital Beirut until at least Monday “due to the current developments in the Middle East.”
     
            Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will be buried today in Qatar, as his killing raises fears that Israel’s war with the Palestinian militant group in Gaza could spiral into a fully-fledged Middle East conflict.
     
            US President Joe Biden said the assassination had “not helped” the chances of a ceasefire deal and expressed concern about the escalating tensions in the region after Iran vowed retaliation for Haniyeh’s killing on its soil.
     
            Biden is also weighing more US defenses in the Middle East as the US prepares for an Iranian retaliation against Israel that officials say could include an attack on American forces.
     
            Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran using a hidden explosive device, a source told CNN, becoming the third high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups to be killed in recent weeks.
     
Here’s what else you need to know:
 
            The assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh has “not helped” the chances of  a ceasefire deal in Gaza, US President Joe Biden said Thursday.
     
            Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews after greeting Americans released in a historic prisoner swap with Russia, Biden also expressed concern about the escalating tensions in the Middle East after Iran vowed retaliation for Haniyeh’s killing on its soil.
     
            “We’re very concerned about it,” Biden said, adding he and Vice President Kamala Harris had discussed the matter on Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
     
        “I had a very direct meeting with the prime minister today. And – very direct. We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it and they should move on it now,” Biden said.
     
 
            Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages had already hit repeated roadblocks before Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed on Tuesday night. 
     
            He was assassinated in Tehran using a hidden explosive device, a source told CNN, becoming the third high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups to be killed in recent weeks.
     
            Iran and Hamas have blamed the assassination on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in his killing. 
 
            The body of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh arrived in Doha on Thursday from Iran in preparation for his burial on Friday, videos obtained by CNN show.
     
            Haniyeh’s funeral prayer will be held after the Friday prayer at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque in the Qatari capital, followed by the burial at the Imam Founder Cemetery in the city of Lusail, according to Hamas and Qatari state media.
     
            Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on Wednesday using an explosive device that had been hidden in the guest house where he was staying, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.
     
            Israeli protesters gathered in Tel Aviv Thursday to demand the government reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal as they marked 300 days since Hamas’ devastating October 7 attack on Israel.
     
            Hostages’ families were joined by a sea of supporters holding images of their loved ones at Hostages Square as they urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring them home, the rallying cry of the campaign to support the captives, which keeps a ticker of how long their kidnap ordeal has lasted prominently on its homepage.
     
        “Benjamin Netanyahu, I expected, hoped, and prayed, but time and again, you fail to do what you should have done 300 days ago: stop everything and focus on one thing - bringing everyone back immediately!” said Nissan Kalderon, brother of hostage Ofer Kalderon.
     
 
            At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted to Gaza in Hamas’ October 7 assault, according to Israeli authorities.
     
            Israel’s military response in the strip has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to UN figures.
     
“Brief window”: There are 111 hostages still in Gaza, including 39 believed to be dead, according to data from Netanyahu’s office. Many families have repeatedly slammed the prime minister for failing to secure their release.
     
            Anat Angrest, mother of hostage Matan Angrest, cited “consensus among all security agencies” that there is only “a brief window of opportunity for a life-saving deal.” 
     
        “Right now, as we speak, dozens of hostages are being tortured, dozens have already been murdered, and information about their burial sites is vanishing,” she said.
     
 
            Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages had already hit repeated roadblocks before Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed on Tuesday night. Iran and Hamas have blamed the assassination on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in his killing. 
 
            Destroyed homes, looting, and a desire for revenge. A former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservist has alleged serious misconduct by Israeli forces in Gaza, and a lack of discipline in the command structure, in an interview with CNN.
     
            Yuval Green, a 26-year-old former paratrooper, is one of a handful of soldiers who have served in Israel’s war against Hamas and are now publicly criticizing the way it is being prosecuted.
     
            Green described the behavior and alleged misdeeds of his reservist peers while serving in the Palestinian enclave, and the day he decided to tell his commanders he could no longer be part of his unit.
     
“Demonizing Gazans”: Green said that the anger felt by Israelis after October 7 and calls for revenge were expressed openly in his unit, as they waited to be sent into Gaza, and called it the “demonizing” of Palestinians.
     
        “In the days before we entered Khan Younis … there was this atmosphere that was kind of growing of demonizing the Gazans,” he said, adding that he heard people “speaking about killing, ruining all of Gaza. Wiping it out became something that people (were discussing), as if it was some kind of a legitimate idea.”
     
 
            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on Green’s allegations.

President Joe Biden is weighing more US defenses in the Middle East as the US prepares for an Iranian retaliation against Israel that officials say could include an attack on American forces.
     
            In a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday, Biden said the US would “support Israel’s defense against threats,” which would include “new defensive US military deployments,” according to a readout of the call.
     
            The statement did not detail what new deployments would occur ahead of an anticipated Iranian attack in response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. According to several US officials, the Pentagon has discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region, but no final decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon. The officials said an Iranian response could occur in the coming days.
     
            The USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group, which includes the aircraft carrier, destroyers and other warships, has been operating in the Gulf of Oman in recent weeks. The strike group could potentially move into the Gulf of Aden or the Red Sea, where Navy warships have intercepted dozens of Houthi launches over the past several months.
     
            The USS Wasp amphibious assault ship and several other Navy vessels are currently operating in the Mediterranean Sea. The group includes a Marine expeditionary unit capable of carrying out an evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon if the US ordered such an evacuation.
     
            Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) promised a “harsh” and “painful” response to the assassination. Israel has not commented on the killing.

            Hezbollah said it launched dozens of rockets toward northern Israel late Thursday after its leader vowed a response to Israel’s attack in southern Beirut earlier this week that killed the Iran-backed militant group’s top commander.
     
            Dozens of rockets were fired from Lebanon toward Israeli territory, the Israel Defense Forces said late Thursday.
     
            The military estimated just five crossed into Israel and there are no reports of damage or injuries.
     
            Earlier, sirens sounded across various communities in the western Galilee region, after two days without launches detected from Lebanon.
     
            Israeli planes “struck the Hezbollah launcher from which the projectiles were launched in the area of Yater in southern Lebanon,” the IDF said shortly after the launches were carried out.
     
            IDF artillery had fired to remove threats in the areas of Rmaych and Ramyeh in southern Lebanon, it added.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech Thursday that the group would resume confrontations on the border, but they should not be “mistaken” for the promised response to the killing of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, on Tuesday.
     
Remember: Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, operates out of southern Lebanon.
     
            The recent killing of three high-profile figures in Iran-backed militant groups, which have had repeated clashes with Israel throughout its war in Gaza, has raised fears of a broader Middle East conflict.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed a response to Israel’s attack in southern Beirut earlier this week that killed the group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr and at least five civilians.
     
            “This was not just an assassination operation. This was an assault,” Nasrallah said in a fiery speech Thursday during a funeral procession for Shukr in southern Beirut.
     
            Nasrallah said the response would go beyond the scope of the daily border skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces that have been ongoing during Israel’s war with Hamas, adding that the retaliation will be “studied.”
     
        The Hezbollah chief was speaking against the backdrop of a photo of Shukr on a red screen, a visual cue for revenge. “The enemy, and those who back the enemy, must wait for our inevitable response,” Nasrallah said.
     
 
            He stopped short of declaring war but said Israel had crossed “red lines” in Beirut, as well as in Tehran with the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, which Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility for the killing.
     
            “They’ve picked a fight with all of us,” Nasrallah said, referring to the Iran-backed network of armed groups that spans Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iraq.
     
            “On all supportive fronts, we have now entered a new phase, different than the past phase,” he said, referring to the Iran-backed axis.
     
Remember: Shukr is one of three high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups to be killed in recent weeks. 
     
            Haniyeh was killed Wednesday by an explosive device planted two months before the explosion, a source told CNN. And Israel says a strike last month in Gaza killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ military wing.
     
            Israel’s military has said that one of the reported masterminds of the October 7 attacks, Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif, was killed in a strike it carried out in southern Gaza last month.
     
            The claim of Deif’s death comes a day after Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran.
     
            An Israeli military official told CNN they received new intelligence in recent hours that gave them the confidence to confirm Deif was killed, nearly three weeks after it carried out the strike in Khan Younis. The official declined to specify the nature of that intelligence.
     
            There was no immediate statement from Hamas. CNN has approached the militant group for comment.

            The body of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh arrived in Doha on Thursday from Iran in preparation for his burial on Friday, videos obtained by CNN show.
     
            Haniyeh’s funeral prayer will be held after the Friday prayer at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque in the Qatari capital, followed by the burial at the Imam Founder Cemetery in the city of Lusail, according to Hamas and Qatari state media.
     
            Video obtained by CNN showed Haniyeh’s wife, known as Umm al-Abed, crying over the coffin and mourning her husband.
     
            “You strengthened us every day, making us as strong and determined as iron. We owe it all to you,” she said.
     
            Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed a response to Israel’s attack in southern Beirut earlier this week, which killed the group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr and at least five civilians, including two children, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
     
            “This was not just an assassination operation. This was an assault,” Nasrallah said in a fiery speech Thursday afternoon during a funeral procession for Shukr in southern Beirut.
     
            Nasrallah said the response would go beyond the scope of the daily border skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces that have been ongoing during Israel’s war with Hamas, adding that the retaliation will be “studied.”
     
        The Hezbollah chief was speaking against the backdrop of a photo of Shukr on a red screen, a visual cue for revenge. “The enemy, and those who back the enemy, must wait for our inevitable response,” Nasrallah said.
     
 
            He stopped short of declaring war but said Israel had crossed “red lines” in Beirut, as well as in Tehran with the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, which Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility for the killing.
     
            “They’ve picked a fight with all of us,” Nasrallah said, referring to the Iran-backed network of armed groups that spans Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iraq.
     
            “On all supportive fronts, we have now entered a new phase, different than the past phase,” he said, referring to the Iran-backed axis.
     
Remember: Shukr is one of three high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups to be killed in recent weeks. 
     
            Haniyeh was killed Wednesday by an explosive device planted two months before the explosion, a source tells CNN. And Israel says a strike last month in Gaza killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ military wing.
     
            Israeli airstrikes on a shelter in Shujaya, central Gaza, killed at least 15 Palestinians and injured dozens more people on Thursday, according to the Gaza Civil Defense.
     
            Three missiles struck the Dalal al-Mughrabi school, where many hundreds of displaced people had sought refuge, according to Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal. He added that the strikes “targeted a school that houses large numbers of civilians.”
     
        “There are many martyrs who are still under the rubble of that school. This school houses thousands of civilians and was completely destroyed,” he told CNN. 
     
 
            The Israeli military confirmed the attack, claiming the school “was used by Hamas as a hideout for commanders and operatives and to plan terror attacks against the State of Israel.” CNN cannot independently verify the IDF statement.
     
            Video obtained by CNN filming the arrival of casualties at the nearby Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital showed donkey carts rushing through the courtyard to evacuate the dead and wounded. 
     
            A recent Israeli military incursion in the neighborhood had already severely damaged the Dalal al-Mughrabi school and an adjacent school, but hundreds of desperate Palestinians had returned to build makeshift shelters there.
     
            In a separate attack, two children were reported killed in an Israeli airstrike in Nuseirat, also in central Gaza. The bodies of the two children were taken to the local Al-Awda Hospital. Footage obtained by CNN shows Palestinians carrying shellshocked children, with their screams filling the corridors of the medical facility.

            About a dozen Palestinian journalists coalesced outside Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza on Thursday to protest against the killing of their colleagues in a reported Israeli airstrike earlier this week.
     
            CNN footage from the demonstration showed reporters wearing their blue press vests and lining the courtyard of the medical facility, east of Gaza City. The sound of Israeli drones cuts through overhead. 
     
            Al Jazeera correspondent Anas Al-Sharif and others paid tribute to their late colleagues, carrying photos and slogans that read: “Journalism is not a crime.”
     
        I and all my fellow journalists will continue the coverage (of the war) … We are the bearers of a just cause,” Al-Sharif said. “We have been entrusted with this, and we must convey it to the world through our platforms and screens.”
     
 
Calls for press freedom: The vigil came a day after Al Jazeera staffers Ismail Al-Ghoul and Rami Al-Rifi, both aged 27, were killed in a reported Israeli strike while on assignment in Al-Shati refugee camp, sparking condemnation from advocacy groups in what has been the deadliest period for journalists since 1992.
     
            A third Palestinian, 16-year-old Khaled Al-Shawa, was also killed in the strike on Wednesday, according to local reporters. The teenager had been riding his orange bicycle to deliver food for an elderly resident in the neighborhood before he was killed, according to Saudi-backed broadcaster Al-Arabiya
 
Khader Al-Za’anoun of WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, also contributed reporting from Gaza City.
 
            Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital of Tehran on Wednesday using an explosive device that had been covertly hidden weeks prior, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.
     
            The bomb was concealed in a guest house where Haniyeh was known to stay about two months ago and detonated remotely once he was inside his room there, according to the source, who was briefed on the operation.
     
            The New York Times was first to report the details of Haniyeh’s assassination.
     
            The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.
     
            US officials were briefed on the operation by Israeli officials only after the assassination, the source said.
     
            Iranian state media and Hamas previously indicated Haniyeh was killed via a rocket fired from outside the building.
     
            But the fact that the bomb was smuggled inside the guest house, which was under the protection of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, indicates a startling breach of security for the IRGC.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday: “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment.”
     
            CNN is asking the Iranian government for reaction to this new reporting.
     
Blow to Hamas: Haniyeh’s death is, both strategically and symbolically, a dramatic blow to Hamas, eliminating its most public figure who headed up the group’s political operations while living overseas. 
     
            His killing also sparked concerns over stalled negotiations to reach a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have killed 39,840 Palestinians and razed patches of land into rubble-filled wasteland. Haniyeh played a leading role representing Hamas in months-long truce talks.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is on “very high alert,” after a barrage of attacks against its adversaries on multiple fronts in the region sparked fears of a wider war.
     
        “Israel is on a very high alert for all scenarios, both in defense and offense,” he said in an update released by the prime minister’s office, adding that Israeli forces will “exact a very high price for any act of aggression against us from any arena.”
     
 
How we got here: The assassinations of two high-profile Iran-backed leaders in the past week has caused ripples across the Middle East. Hamas on Wednesday said Israel killed its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in the Iranian capital of Tehran. Israel has not confirmed or denied killing Haniyeh.
     
            It came hours after Israel claimed a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend.
     
            Then on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had killed Hamas’ military leader Mohammed Deif in a July 13 airstrike in southern Gaza. The Israeli assault on Al-Mawasi killed at least 90 Palestinians and left a trail of mass carnage.
     
            Commenting on reports of Deif’s death, Netanyahu said: “He was Israel’s number one wanted man for years. His elimination reinforces the simple principle we have established: those who harm us — we will harm them.”
     
            The leader of Hezbollah has warned the militant group will definitely respond to avenge the killing of its commander in an Israeli strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday. 
     
        We are not saying we are reserving the right to respond — we will respond, this is definite,” Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech Thursday. 
     
 
            “The enemy, and those behind our enemy, should wait for our definite response,” Nasrallah said, adding “there is not discussion or debate … We are looking for a real response, not a symbolic one.”
     
Some context: Nasrallah made the remarks after the funeral for Fu’ad Shukr, who Israel blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Nasrallah denied that Hezbollah was behind the assault.
     
            The killing of two high ranking officials of Iranian-backed groups in recent days marked the latest regional escalation during Israel’s war in Gaza.
     
            The leader of Hezbollah has warned Israel “doesn’t realized the red lines it has crossed,” following a spate of Israeli attacks on multiple fronts in the Middle East.
     
            “On all supportive fronts, we have now entered a new phase, different than the past phase,” the paramilitary group’s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech in Lebanon on Thursday. The fronts Nasrallah references involve Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
     
        “Today (Israel) has to wait, wait for the anger of those who are honorable in this nation, revenge by the honorable of this nation … for all the spilled blood,” the Hezbollah chief said.
     
 
            Nasrallah also rejected Israel’s accusation that the militant group orchestrated a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, saying Hezbollah’s “internal investigations” show that the group “have nothing to do” with the assault.
     
            The rocket blast tore through the town of Majdal Shams and killed at least 12 people. The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN. 
     
            Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah paid tribute to the slain Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, as he delivered a speech on Thursday.
     
            Nasrallah made the remarks off the back of the funeral for the Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on Tuesday. 
     
            Israel had blamed Hezbollah for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. 
     
            The killing of two leaders of Iranian-backed groups this week marked the latest regional flare-up, as Israel’s war in Gaza rages on. 
     
            Israel claimed credit for the assassination of Shukr, but has not confirmed nor denied a role in the death of Haniyeh in Tehran early Wednesday. 
     
            The funeral of Hezbollah top commander Fu’ad Shukr has started in Lebanon’s capital of Beirut on Thursday.
     
            Hezbollah Secretary General Hasan Nassrallah is expected to deliver a speech at 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET).
     
            Israel said it killed Shukr, Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah confirmed the death of Shukr.
     
            Iran’s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani spoke with several regional counterparts to discuss the assassination of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh as concerns mount over escalating tensions between Iran and Israel.
     
            Iran has accused Israel of assassinating Haniyeh in his northern Tehran residence on Wednesday. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack.
     
            Kani spoke separately with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi.
     
            Iran’s acting foreign minister told his Saudi counterpart that Iran will use its “legitimate right to take remorseful and decisive action against” Israel.
     
            Kani told the Qatari prime minister that Israel attacked Iran’s national security by killing Haniyeh, an “official guest” who was in Iran attending the inauguration of the Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.  
     
            Speaking to the Turkish foreign minister, Kani said that the attack in Iran will pose “serious threats to regional security and stability.”
     
            A member of Hamas’ political bureau insisted that only the military arm could confirm or deny the death of Mohammed Deif in an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza in July.
     
            Izzat Al Rishq posted on Telegram that “confirming or denying the martyrdom of any of the Qassam leaders is the responsibility of the Qassam Brigades leadership and the movement leadership.” 
     
            “Unless either of them announces it, no news published in the media or by any other parties can be confirmed,” Al Rishq added. 
     
            It came after the Israeli military said its fighter jets killed Hamas’ military chief in July, who is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attacks. The Israeli killed at least 90 Palestinians and injured 300 people in Al-Mawasi, according to Gazan health officials, leaving a trail of mass carnage in its wake.
     
            At least eight people lining up for aid at a Gaza refugee camp were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Thursday, according to Palestinian witnesses. Two children and their mother were also injured in the attack and the dead and injured were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, according to CNN footage.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike. 
     
            The video showed generations of Palestinian men flocking outside the hospital in Deir al-Balah. Pools of blood streaked the floors of the medical facility. Mourners cowered over shrouded bodies, delicately kissing the deceased and wailing in disbelief.  
     
        “My family went out to get some goods to survive and were killed in cold blood,” said Nidal Abdo, a resident of Al-Maghazi. “We don’t understand what is happening. This is too much for us to bear… The bloodbath doesn’t stop.”
     
 
            In another scene, rows of worshippers stood to perform Janazah, the Islamic funeral prayers. Echoes of “Allahu Akbar,” which means “God is greater” in Arabic, filled a courtyard of the refugee camp. Young girls and boys wearing shoes covered in dust crouched near the ceremony, their eyes tired with grief. 
     
            “We want to live in dignity like the rest of the world,” added Abdo. “We are in a genocide… We beg for everyone to stop this war.”

            Israel on Thursday said it killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ military wing and a key architect of the October 7 attacks, last month. The announcement followed the death of two other high-profile leaders of Iran-backed militant groups – notably Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh – in the past few days.
     
            The Israeli military said it killed Deif on July 13 in a strike on Khan Younis. Those same attacks also killed at least 90 Palestinians in the sprawling tent city of Al-Mawasi. CNN reached out to Hamas to confirm Deif’s death but has not heard back. 
     
            Israel has claimed the death of Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr in Beirut, but has not confirmed or denied a role in Haniyeh’s death in Tehran, which Iran and Hamas has blamed on the Israelis.
     
Here’s what to know: 
 
            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has said the killing of Hamas’ military chief is a “significant milestone in the process of dismantling Hamas as a military and governing authority in Gaza.”
     
            The Israeli military said they killed Mohammed Deif in an airstrike in Khan Younis in July. 
     
        Gallant said the attack “reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated.”
     
 
            Deif’s death would be the killing of the highest-ranking Hamas military official in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN has contacted Hamas for comment.
     
            The Israeli attack on him killed at least 90 Palestinians in Al-Mawasi, half of whom were women and children, according to Gazan health officials. At the time, a UN worker described the aftermath as “the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”
     
            The Israeli military said Thursday that its fighter jets killed Hamas’ military chief in Gaza – Mohammed Deif – in a strike in Khan Younis on July 13.
     
            Israel’s confirmation that Deif was killed in southern Gaza came nearly three weeks after it carried out the strike, which killed at least 90 Palestinians in the sprawling tent city of Al-Mawasi. 
     
            Footage from Al-Mawasi, which has been designated as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting elsewhere, showed bodies in the street and destroyed tents.
     
What does Israel say? An Israeli military official told CNN they recently received new intelligence that gave them the confidence to confirm Deif was killed in the airstrike, but declined to specify the nature of that intelligence.
     
            The Israeli military said that they launched a “precise, targeted strike” where Deif was staying, adding that “additional terrorist operatives were also eliminated during the strike.” CNN cannot independently verify IDF statements.
     
            At the time of the attack, Israeli officials said they had indications their strike was successful but were not able to confirm that he was killed until now.
     
Who is Mohammed Deif? Deif is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the Hamas-led October 7 attacks into southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted.
     
            Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded another 55 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry in the enclave.
     
            “A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them,” the ministry said.
     
            Nearly 300 days of the Israeli military campaign has killed 39,480 Palestinians and wounded another 91,128 people.
     
            CNN is unable to confirm the figures, partly because Gaza is largely inaccessible to international media. Both Israel and Egypt, which control Gaza’s borders, have refused to give international journalists unfettered access to the strip, saying that they cannot guarantee their safety.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged all parties in the Middle East not to take “escalatory actions” a day after Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated.
     
        “Right now, the path that the region is on is toward more conflict, more violence, more suffering, more insecurity. And it is crucial that we break the cycle. And that starts with a ceasefire,” Blinken said.“To get there, it requires all parties to stop taking any escalatory actions.”
     
 
            Blinken said he couldn’t predict the effect of “any one event on what comes next,” but a “ceasefire to have an end to the conflict in Gaza to produce calm in the north, between Israel and Lebanon” was in the interest of everyone.
     
            All parties need to find “reasons to come to an agreement, not to look for reasons to delay or say no to the agreement,” he said.
     
            Blinken said he has been talking to his colleagues throughout the region over the last 24 hours and they were all focused on reaching a ceasefire. 
     
            He also expressed confidence that a deal could still be reached because it is “imperative that we do so.” 
     
        “It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the days ahead,” he added.
     
 
Remember: Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group killed within days, following Israel’s killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Beirut in Lebanon.
     
            Israel will not be invited to this year’s peace ceremony commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki to promote a “peaceful and somber atmosphere” at the August 9 event, the city’s mayor said.
     
            The decision contrasts with that of Hiroshima, whose authorities told CNN last month they had no intention of retracting Israel’s invitation to their own peace event, despite calls for the country to be sidelined.
     
            Both cities had been under pressure from activists and bomb survivor groups to exclude Israel due to its assault on Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since Israel began targeting Hamas following the militant group’s October 7 attack.
     
            Nagasaki’s mayor Shiro Suzuki said that Israel’s exclusion was due to security concerns and was not a political decision.
     
        “I would like to emphasize that this decision was not based on political considerations, but rather on our desire to hold the ceremony to commemorate the victims of the atomic bombings in a peaceful and solemn atmosphere, and to ensure that the ceremony goes smoothly,” he said, calling the decision “difficult.”

            The coffins of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and his bodyguard are being moved in a procession through Iran’s capital Tehran.
     
            Thousands of mourners are lining the streets.
     
            The procession is due to go from Tehran University towards Azadi Square, according to Iranian news agency Mehr News, a distance of about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles).
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is leading a prayer service in Tehran for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. 
     
            The prayer service is taking place at Tehran University in Iran’s capital.
     
            Hamas spokesperson and deputy head Khalil Al-Hayya has spoken at the service for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran.
     
            Live pictures show the coffin of Haniyeh draped in a Palestinian flag along with his photo.
     
            Thousands have gathered at the site, many of them holding Palestinian and Iranian flags, as well as placards bearing Haniyeh’s face.
     
            Thousands have gathered in the Iranian capital, Tehran, at a memorial service for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            A procession is scheduled to start at Tehran University and will head towards Azadi Square, according to Iranian news agency Mehr News.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will lead prayers for Haniyeh today, according to Iranian state media, and the country has announced three days of public mourning.
     
            According to live pictures of the service, thousands were seen gathered together to listen to Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the speaker of Iran’s parliament.
     
            Many in the crowd were seen waving the Palestinian and Iranian flags as well as the yellow flag of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
     
            Haniyeh will be buried in Qatar’s capital, Doha, on Friday, Hamas said. Before his assassination, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha, where Hamas had a political office.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge the death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran yesterday. 
     
            Hamas said Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination. 
 
            The killing is a major escalation of conflict in the region that throws it into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase.
     
            Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in recent days, following Israel’s killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.
     
            Iran’s supreme leader will lead memorial prayers for Haniyeh today, according to Iranian state media.
     
Here’s what to know.
 
Here are the latest developments stoking tensions in the region:
 
            Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.
     
            Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. local time (10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) until 10:30 a.m. local time (2:30 a.m. ET Thursday), according to the notice.
     
            Haniyeh’s memorial procession will be held from the University of Tehran towards the capital’s Azadi Square, Iran’s semi-official news agency Mehr News said.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will lead prayers Thursday morning, according to Iran’s state-run PressTV news outlet. 
     
            Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization regularly issues Notice to Air Missions across the country, which alert pilots to issues that impact flight operations. But the one in place for Thursday specifically restricts flights in the airspace surrounding where Haniyeh’s procession is due to take place and within the same frame.
     
            Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations blamed the United States for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, claiming that it could not have happened without US authorization and intelligence support.
     
        “The responsibility of the United States as their strategic ally, and main supporters of the Israeli regime in the region cannot be overlooked in this horrific crime,” said Saeed Iravani, permanent representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the UN, in a speech at the Security Council on Wednesday.
     
 
            Hamas said Haniyeh was killed by Israel, and Iran has vowed to avenge his death. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.
     
        “Israel was also pursuing [a] political goal with this act, aiming to disrupt the first day of the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prioritized strengthening peace and stability in the region, and enhancing cooperation and constructive engagement with international community,” Iravani added.
     
 
            Earlier today, US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”
     
            The assassination of the Hamas’ political leader has plunged the Middle East into fresh crisis and dented already slim hopes of an end to the war between Israel and the militant group that rules Gaza anytime soon.
     
            Hamas on Wednesday said Israel killed its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran, hours after Israel claimed a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s killing.
     
Future of ceasefire talks unclear: Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas had already hit repeated roadblocks before Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed.
     
            As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement. All of that could now be thrown up in the air by his death.
     
            A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s assassination could “complicate mediation talks.” The source said Haniyeh was a “key decision-maker,” along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.
     
            “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source said, adding that “at this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on ceasefire talks.”

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed his nation Wednesday after the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and senior Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr.
     
            Israel has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days, he said in a televised statement.
     
        “Three weeks ago, we attacked the military chief of Hamas, Mohammad Deif. Two weeks ago we attacked the Houthis, in one of the farthest attacks the Air Force has carried out. Yesterday we attacked the military chief of Hezbollah, Fu’ad Shukr,” the prime minister said.
     
 
            Netanyahu said Israel is facing “challenging days.”
     
            “These are challenging days. There are threats From Beirut. We are ready for any scenario. We are prepared,” he said.
     
        “We’ll settle the score with anyone who harms us, anyone who massacres our children, anyone who murders our citizens, anyone who hurts our nation, blood is on his head,” he also said. 
     
 
            He noted his determination to keep the fight going until the aims of the war were achieved. Netanyahu referenced previous calls he has received to end the war in Gaza, saying, “I did not give in then and I am not giving in today.”
     
            Netanyahu did not mention the death of Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.
     
            CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, state media outlets, and other social media posts to analyze and track Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.
     
            After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to Gaza with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.
     
Tehran: Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
     
            In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 
     
            On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he attended the inauguration of the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian.
     
Cairo: He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December, and February to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. Qatar and Egypt have shepherded that negotiation process, which is still ongoing.  
     
Doha: As Israel’s war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.
     
            Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings would only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender and will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Our live coverage of conflict in the Middle East has moved here.
 
            Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.
     
            Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. local time (10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) until 10:30 a.m. local time (2:30 a.m. ET Thursday), according to the notice.
     
            Haniyeh’s procession will be held from the University of Tehran towards the capital’s Azadi Square, Iran’s semi-official news agency Mehr News said.
     
            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will lead prayers Thursday morning, according to Iran’s state-run PressTV news outlet. 
     
            Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization regularly issues Notice to Air Missions across the country, which alert pilots to issues that impact flight operations. But the one in place for Thursday specifically restricts flights in the airspace surrounding where Haniyeh’s procession is due to take place and within the same frame.
     
            Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.
     
            In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.
     
            At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.
     
            Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 
     
            In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
     
            Israel’s representative speaking at the UN Security Council, Jonathan Miller, urged the United Nations to “hold the Islamic Republic accountable for its crimes” related to its support of groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. 
     
            Miller called Iran “the very engine driving the machinery of death and destruction that threatens us all.”  
     
        “Those who rarely seek stability in the region should work on the removal of arch terrorists, not call on both sides to restrain themselves,” Miller said. 
     
 
            Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            Feda Abdelhady-Nasser, the deputy permanent observer of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, called for accountability in the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and condemned what she called Israel’s “criminal breach” of the territorial integrity of its neighboring countries with recent strikes on Lebanon and Iran. 
     
        “We call again, with utmost urgency, on the Security Council, the General Assembly, and all law-abiding, peace-loving nations to act forthwith to bring a halt to these horrific criminal Israeli aggressions against the Palestinian people and on our region,” she said speaking at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday.
     
 
            “We demand accountability for this assassination, as we have continually demanded accountability for the wanton murder and injury of over 130,000 Palestinian children, women, and men across these past 300 days of horror and hell in Gaza. And call for accountability for all of Israel’s criminal policies and practices in our territory across the decades,” she continued.
     
            Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations blamed the United States for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, claiming that it could not have happened without US authorization and intelligence support.
     
        “The responsibility of the United States as their strategic ally, and main supporters of the Israeli regime in the region cannot be overlooked in this horrific crime,” said Saeed Iravani, permanent representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the UN, in a speech at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday.
     
 
            Hamas said its political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in an overnight strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.
     
            “Israel was also pursuing [a] political goal with this act, aiming to disrupt the first day of the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prioritized strengthening peace and stability in the region, and enhancing cooperation and constructive engagement with international community,” Iravani added. 
     
            Earlier today, US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood  said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”
     
            US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood urged the United Nations Security Council to support what he called Israel’s “right to defend itself against attacks” from groups like Hezbollah. He also called on the council to hold Iran accountable for its support of such groups, as well as its alleged violations of international law.
     
            “Israel has a right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, and other terrorists,” Wood said. “That is precisely what it did on July 30.” 
     
            Wood said that although the US was not involved with Israel’s response on July 30 in Lebanon, “there is no doubt absolutely none that Hezbollah was responsible for this attack, which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah.”
     
            Wood said Iran has to comply with existing Security Council resolutions or face additional measures. 
     
            Wood also said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”
     
            The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it is closely monitoring the rapidly developing regional situation, and expressing deep concern over the ongoing escalation and its implications for security and stability in the region, in a statement posted by the Emirati state news agency WAM on Wednesday.
     
        “The United Arab Emirates emphasizes the importance of exercising the utmost restraint and wisdom to avoid risks and the expansion of the conflict,” the statement reads. 
     
 
            Anwar Mohammed Gargash, serving as a senior diplomatic advisor to the President of the United Arab Emirates, also expressed grave concerns over the recent developments in the region. 
     
            In a statement on X, Gargash highlighted the “alarming events” unfolding from Beirut to Tehran across various fronts.
     
        “The significant and worrying developments occurring in the region, from Beirut to Tehran and across various fronts, are extremely concerning. Escalation and uncalculated reactions, with no regard for the laws governing inter-state relations and sovereignty, complicate the situation and increase the risk of instability. Diplomatic and political efforts have become more urgent and imperative,” Anwar said on X.
     
 
            Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, according to the New York Times. 
     
            The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 
     
            The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.
     
            Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 
     
            “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel. 
     
            CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.
     
            After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.
     
Tehran: Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
     
            In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 
     
            On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.
     
Cairo: He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  
     
Doha: As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.
     
            Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.
     
            An Israeli strike in southern Beirut on Tuesday has now killed at least six people, the Lebanese state news agency NNA reported on Wednesday. 
     
            The death toll includes at least two women and two children, according to previous health ministry statements. 
     
            Hezbollah earlier confirmed the death of senior commander Fu’ad Shukr. It is unclear if NNA’s reported death toll includes Shukr.
     
            Emergency responders are still working on lifting the rubble in the area that was hit, NNA added.
     
            The US State Department is now warning Americans not to travel to Lebanon “due to rising tensions” between Hezbollah and Israel, raising the travel advisory for the entire country to level 4.
     
            “Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to rising tensions between Hizballah and Israel,” the State Department said in an updated advisory Wednesday. “If you are in Lebanon, be prepared to shelter in place should the situation deteriorate.”
     
            “The U.S. Embassy strongly encourages U.S. citizens who are already in Southern Lebanon, near the borders with Syria, and/or in refugee settlements to depart,” it said. 
     
            The State Department had previously warned American against traveling to southern Lebanon, but the update to warning against travel to the entire country reflects the ratcheting up of tensions in the region.
     
            The updated advisory comes a day after an Israeli strike on a Hezbollah commander in Beirut.
     
            A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 
     
            Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 
     
            She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.
     
        “I have little faith in the prime minister of Israel. I have seen him again and again doing the same thing Hamas is doing and delaying negotiations. When there was the first deal they stopped it, they could have continued it and rescued many more people,” Lifschitz said. 
     
 
            Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 
     
            “Our loved ones are not here. We’re not hugging them. We’re not burying the dead. We are not seeing a return of some sanity to the region, and it’s hard to sit here and imagine how they must be feeling in Gaza when they see this,” she added.
     
            White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday that the White House “can’t confirm or verify” reports from Hamas that the group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in the Iranian capital of Tehran. 
     
            He acknowledged Wednesday that the deaths of Haniyeh and senior Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr in southern Beirut Tuesday “certainly don’t help with the temperature going down.”
     
        “I’m not going to be Pollyannish about it — we’re obviously concerned about escalation,” Kirby told reporters during Wednesday’s White House press briefing. “All of this adds to the complicated nature of what we’re trying to get done.” 
     
 
            US President Joe Biden was briefed on the reports, Kirby said. However, he did not offer additional details on when the president was made aware of this specific strike. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters traveling with him in Singapore that the US was “not aware of or involved in” in the killing of the Hamas leader. 
     
            Earlier Wednesday, CNN reported the secretary of state has been working the phones in an effort keep ceasefire talks on track, speaking with both Jordan’s Ayman Safadi and Qatar’s Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.
     
            Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.
     
            Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in the past day, following the killing by Israel of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.
     
            Hezbollah has confirmed the death of senior commander Fu’ad Shukr.
     
        “We celebrate the great jihadist leader, dear beloved brother Fu’ad Shukr (Moshin) as a great martyr on the path to Jerusalem,” Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday.
     
 
Remember: Israel said its strike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Shukr, whom it blamed for a deadly Saturday attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
     
            The leader of the Iran-backed paramilitary force, Hassan Nasrallah, will issue a statement on Thursday at the funeral of Shukr, the statement added.
     
            “As for our political position on this heinous attack and major crime, it will be expressed by the Secretary-General of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah tomorrow at the funeral procession for the martyred leader,” the statement said.
     
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed his nation Wednesday after the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and senior Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr.
     
            Israel has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days, he said in a televised statement.
     
            “Three weeks ago, we attacked the military chief of Hamas, Mohammad Deif. Two weeks ago we attacked the Houthis, in one of the farthest attacks the Air Force has carried out. Yesterday we attacked the military chief of Hezbollah, Fu’ad Shukr,” the prime minister said.
     
            Netanyahu said Israel is facing “challenging days.”
     
            “These are challenging days. There are threats From Beirut. We are ready for any scenario. We are prepared,” he said.
     
        “We’ll settle the score with anyone who harms us, anyone who massacres our children, anyone who murders our citizens, anyone who hurts our nation, blood is on his head,” he also said. 
     
 
            He noted his determination to keep the fight going until the aims of the war are achieved. Netanyahu referenced previous calls he has received to end the war in Gaza, saying, “I did not give in then and I am not giving in today.”
     
            Netanyahu did not mention the death of Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.
     
            The United States State Department said the US is ready to take “every possible measure” to protect US personnel in the Middle East region, following threatening rhetoric by Iranian leaders following the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil.
     
        “The United States of course will take every possible measure to appropriately and accurately protect our personnel, our interests, in the region and beyond, should we need to,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said at a news conference.
     
 
            Patel reiterated Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s comments that the US was not involved in the killing.
     
            United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said attacks in Beirut and Tehran on Tuesday and Wednesday “represent a dangerous escalation” in the region.
     
            He said, instead, this should be a “moment in which all efforts should instead be leading to a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all Israeli hostages, a massive increase of humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza and a return to calm in Lebanon and across the Blue Line.”
     
            “Rather than that, what we are seeing are efforts to undermine these goals,” Guterres said in a statement.
     
            The Blue Line is a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights.
     
            “It is increasingly clear, however, that restraint alone is insufficient at this extremely sensitive time. The Secretary-General urges all to vigorously work towards regional de-escalation in the interest of long-term peace and stability for all,” the statement said.
     
            The UN chief said that he international community needs to work together to use diplomacy to de-escalate and to try to prevent “any actions that could push the entire Middle East over the edge.”
     
            The military wing of Hamas said it had carried out “two shooting operations” near the city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday in response to the killing of the group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh.  
     
            The Al Qassam Brigades said it was “the beginning of a swift response to the cowardly assassination of our great national leader, the martyr Ismail Haniyeh.” 
     
            “Hebron will lead the way in carrying out qualitative operations in the coming days, by the will of Allah,” it added.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces said a civilian was in the hospital after being shot at and stabbed northeast of Hebron.
     
            Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said a 50-year-old man was hospitalized in serious condition after being stabbed on Route 60 near Kiryat Arba, a settlement on the outskirts of Hebron. It was unclear if the MDA was referring to the incident reported by the IDF. 
     
            The IDF and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) also later said they had apprehended a suspect in connection to the attack, following an “hours-long operation.” The suspect has been “transferred to the ISA for further questioning,” according to the IDF. 
     
            Israel will pay a “heavy price” for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil, senior Iranian diplomat Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X on Wednesday.
     
            Araghchi is expected to become the next foreign minister under the new Pezeshkian administration, according to state media IRNA.
     
        “The Israeli regime will fail to reach its objective of blocking the work of the new government in Iran,” Araghchi said.
     
 
            Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh’s killing.
     
            The body of Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, was found under rubble in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Lebanese security source confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.
     
            Israel on Tuesday said it killed Shukr in a drone strike in a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold.
     
            Israel said it served as retaliation for a deadly strike in the Israeli-occupied town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights on Saturday, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. Hezbollah denied the claim.
     
            Palestinian journalists drew attention to the dangers for local reporters documenting the horrors of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, after two Al Jazeera staffers — Ismail Al-Ghoul and Rami Al-Rifi — were killed by a reported Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Wednesday.
     
            “Ismail was renowned for his professionalism and dedication, bringing the world’s attention to the suffering and atrocities committed in Gaza. … Without Ismail, the world would not have seen the devastating images of these massacres,” the network’s managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, said on X.
     
        “Ismail was a determined journalist who refused to succumb to hunger, illness, and the loss of his brother. He relentlessly covered the events and delivered the reality of Gaza to the world through Al Jazeera. His voice has now been silenced, and there is no longer a need to call out to the world. Ismail fulfilled his mission to his people and his homeland,” Moawad said.
     
 
            Another journalist, Ahmad Al-Alouh, who said he spoke with Al-Ghoul every day, wrote: “Please bring back my beloved.. Why is the world like this.. What is happening to us?”
     
            Hind Khoudary, a freelance reporter working for Al Jazeera, lamented the “heartbreaking” news of Al-Ghoul and Al-Rifi’s deaths. 
     
            “We do everything (to stay safe). We wear our press jackets. We wear our helmets. We try not to go anywhere that is not safe. We try to go to places where we can maintain our security. … It’s a great loss for journalists here in Gaza, especially Al Jazeera’s team, losing such a colleague,” she said.
     
            The world’s largest union for journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, posted on X:
     
        “We are running out of words to condemn this massacre. Israel must stop killing journalists.”
     
 
            CNN has provided details of the strike to the Israeli military and is awaiting comment.
     
            Al Jazeera journalist Ismail Al-Ghoul was wearing a press flak vest when he was killed in a reported Israeli attack in northern Gaza, according to his colleague.
     
            Anas Al-Sharif said on Al Jazeera that a “direct strike” had killed Al-Ghoul along with his cameraman Rami Al-Rifi in Al-Shati refugee camp, where they were reporting near the family home of slain Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
        “Ismail was carrying and covering the suffering of the people of Gaza while wearing this press flak vest but the Israeli occupation doesn’t want the coverage to go out,” Al-Sharif said, as he stood by the bodies of the two men behind him at the nearby Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital.
     
 
            CNN video showed Al-Sharif and another Al Jazeera colleague, Yousef Al Saudi, holding Al-Ghoul’s flak jacket.
     
            Al-Sharif said: “This shield did not protect colleague Ismail, nor did it protect any of our colleagues. As you can see how this shield has become — it is covered in blood and Ismail’s body parts.”
     
        “Dear Ismail, we will complete the mission after you. This is the blood. His remains are still on it,” he said, choking back tears. 
     
 
            Another journalist who spent much of the day with the Al Jazeera crew, Ayman Abed, said he saw one missile hit their vehicle. Video from the scene shows the burnt-out shell of a small car that appears to have been targeted from above.
     
            CNN has provided details of the strike to the Israel Defense Forces and is awaiting comment.
     
Deadliest period for journalists: The Israeli military campaign in Gaza has been the deadliest period for journalists since 1992. As of July 31, at least 111 journalists and media workers have been killed since October —109 of whom were Palestinian — according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). 
     
            CPJ has asked Israel to explain the deaths of the two Al Jazeera journalists in what it said “appears to be a direct strike.”

            The assassination of the Hamas’ political leader has plunged the Middle East into fresh crisis and dented already slim hopes of an end to the war between Israel and the militant group that rules Gaza anytime soon.
     
            Hamas on Wednesday said Israel killed its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran, hours after Israel claimed a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s killing.
     
Future of ceasefire talks unclear: Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas had already hit repeated roadblocks before Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed.
     
            As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement. All of that could now be thrown up in the air by his death.
     
            A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s assassination could “complicate mediation talks.” The source said Haniyeh was a “key decision-maker,” along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.
     
        “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source said, adding that “at this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on ceasefire talks.”
     
 
Read more about the implications his assassination could have.
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Qatari and Jordanian officials on Wednesday following the death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            Blinken had calls with Qatar’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Jordan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi, according to the US State Department. He stressed the importance of the ongoing ceasefire talks — which some fear have now been derailed by the killing of Haniyeh, who was a Hamas negotiator.
     
        Blinken discussed with Safadi “the urgency of efforts to reach a ceasefire to the conflict in Gaza that would secure the release of hostages, allow a surge of humanitarian assistance, and create the conditions for broader stability,” according to the State Department. “He reiterated the importance of preventing further escalation of the conflict,” the readout said.
     
 
            Safadi strongly condemned Haniyeh’s assassination, calling it “a heinous crime and a flagrant violation of international law.”
     
            Qatar called the killing of the Haniyeh a “heinous crime” and a “dangerous escalation.” 
     
            In a post on X Wednesday, Al Thani wrote, “political assassinations & continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?”
     
            Haniyeh was based in Qatar, which hosts Hamas’ political bureau.
     
            Blinken has said the US was “not aware of or involved in” the killing of Haniyeh and said he would not speculate on the impact of the assassination. 
     
The headline and post have been updated with more details on Blinken’s outreach on Wednesday.
 
            Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh had a full schedule of public appearances and meetings before he was assassinated, according to a CNN review of Iranian state media press reports. 
     
            The Israel Defense Forces chief of staff said Israel’s aim is to remove Hezbollah from positions close to the border in southern Lebanon.
     
            While speaking at a brigade-level exercise on the northern border on Monday, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said the the IDF had “an opportunity to eliminate Mohsen,” also known as Fu’ad Shukr, the deputy leader of Hezbollah who was killed in Beirut on Tuesday. Halevi said he was the most senior military figure in Hezbollah and very close to the Iran-backed group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. 
     
        “This man is responsible for giving all the orders, for the 12 children who were killed on Saturday afternoon in Majdal Shams, for the person killed yesterday in HaGoshrim during the afternoon hours,” Halevi said.
     
 
            At least 12 people, including children, were killed when a rocket hit Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights Saturday, Israeli officials said. Hezbollah has admitted targeting other parts of the Golan Heights but “firmly denies” it was behind the deadly strike.
     
            “We will also not let the situation return to having (Hezbollah) present on the border, 200 meters from Metula or from Shtula or from Rosh HaNikra,” Halevi said, listing different town names.
     
            Earlier Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote to a number of international counterparts, urging the implementation of a 2006 United Nations resolution that ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah.
     
            A correspondent for Al Jazeera – Ismail Al-Ghoul – and a colleague were killed in a reported Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza where they were reporting live from a location close to the destroyed family home of the late Hamas’ political chief, Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            Al-Ghoul, 27, and his cameraman Rami Al-Rifi, who both lived in the besieged enclave, were killed in the al Shati refugee camp, according to the Qatar-based network.
     
            Both journalists had been reporting live for much of the day from a location close to the former home of Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital of Tehran.
     
            CNN is seeking comment from the Israeli military.
     
            A journalist working for CNN in Gaza said the crew had been targeted in an Israeli airstrike.
     
        “Ismail was in Al Shati refugee camp with PJ Rami Al-Rifi, where they were filming reactions to the assassination of Haniyeh,” Khader Al-Za’anoun told CNN. “Their bodies are now in Al Ahli hospital and will be buried soon… I cannot believe they are gone.”
     
 
Khader Al-Za’anoun of WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.
 
            Hamas spokesperson and deputy head Khalil al-Hayya said Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room where he was staying in Tehran, and that Hamas’ military wing the Al Qassam Brigades would not let the killing “go unaccounted for.”
     
            Earlier in the day, Iranian state media reported that Haniyeh was killed by an “airborne guided projectile,” though it was unclear what form that took.
     
            Speaking at a press conference in the Iranian capital, al-Hayya said Israel would “pay the price for heinous crime” of assassinating Haniyeh.
     
            Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh’s death.
     
            Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called senior Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal to offer his “deepest condolences” on Wednesday, after the assassination of the group’s political chief.
     
            Abbas spoke to Meshaal after Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran, according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. Meshaal is the head of Hamas’ office in the diaspora, and one of the group’s founders.
     
Some context: The PA, which is dominated by the Fatah political party, held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the enclave. Since then, Hamas had ruled Gaza with the PA governing parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
     
            Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday that his country is not interested in an “all-out war” and urged the implementation of a 2006 United Nations resolution that ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group based in Lebanon.
     
            “Israel is not interested in an all-out war, but the only way to prevent it is the immediate implementation of Resolution 1701,” the minister said in a letter sent to dozens of his international counterparts.
     
        “The world must support Israel at this time, and demand an immediate cessation of Hezbollah’s attacks, its withdrawal to the north of the Litani River, and its disarmament in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1701,” Katz wrote.“Tens of thousands of Israeli residents who have been forced to leave their homes in northern Israel must return home safely,” he continued. 
     
 
Some background: The statement didn’t reference the escalating tension in the region following the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which Iran blamed on Israel, or the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut, which Israel claimed. Iran’s supreme leader has vowed to avenge the death of Haniyeh.
     
            Tehran has leveled blame against Washington for the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh, criticizing the US as a staunch ally of Israel. 
     
            Iran’s foreign ministry pointedly condemned the White House “as a supporter and accomplice of the Zionist regime in the continuation of the occupation and genocide of the Palestinians, in committing this heinous act of terrorism.”
     
            Iran has a right to respond to what it called an “aggressive action” against “sovereignty,” the ministry said on Telegram, calling on international actors that support the rights of the Palestinian people to condemn the assassination.
     
US-Israel relations: The US has remained a key ally of Israel since it launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. More recently, Washington voiced concern over the colossal civilian toll wrought by Israel’s interminable bombing campaign in the Palestinian strip — while continuing to dole out billions of dollars worth of military aid.
     
            Responding to Haniyeh’s killing in Iran on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was “not aware of or involved.” Israel has not commented on the strike, but previously vowed to eliminate Hamas in the wake of October 7.
     
            Senior Iranian diplomats say their country will respond to the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
            “The response to an assassination will indeed be special operations — harder and intended to instill deep regret in the perpetrator,” Iran’s UN Mission in New York posted on X.
     
            The country’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, doubled down on a message from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, saying a response is “definitely coming.”
     
            Speaking in Beirut, Amani stressed that Tehran was not trying to “expand the perimeter” of Israel’s war in Gaza, but said: “Iran in return will not allow this region to be prey to the joint U.S. and Israeli administrations.”
     
Historic tensions: A regional powerhouse, Iran has long been accused of arming and training an axis of militias in the Middle East – including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen – in an effort to broaden its influence across the Middle East. 
     
            Fighting in Gaza has brought a longstanding shadow war between Israel and Iran into the open. Though the Israeli military declined to comment on Haniyeh’s killing, it launched a relentless bombing campaign on Gaza, with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas, after the October 7 attacks on Israel.
     
            Ismail Haniyeh’s fateful trip to Iran this week was not his first to the country since his group launched its deadly assault in Israel on October 7 of last year. 
     
            The political leader of Hamas, which is supported by the Iranian regime, had made several other visits to Tehran since the war with Israel began in Gaza, including one in May where he delivered a eulogy at the funeral of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that month.
     
            In the hours before he was assassinated overnight, Haniyeh attended an inauguration ceremony on Tuesday for Raisi’s replacement, the newly sworn-in President Masoud Pezehkian, and met Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. 
     
            He gave his last known doorstep interview to a reporter in Iran while visiting the “Land of Civilizations,” a newly inaugurated exhibition held in the iconic Milad Tower of Tehran. 
     
        “Today there are attempts to create civilizations, but they are built on killing, spilling of blood and robbing the wealth of populations and occupying other people’s lands. These are fake civilizations that will not survive,” Haniyeh told the reporter after attending the exhibition. 
     
 
            Other previous trips by Haniyeh to Iran include one on March 26, when he met then- Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian — who was also killed in the May helicopter crash — as negotiations on a ceasefire in Gaza were ongoing, and another visit that was revealed in November 2023 and reportedly included a meeting with Khamenei, roughly a month after Hamas’ October 7 attack.  
     
            Israel’s Defense Ministry issued a readout of Yoav Gallant’s call with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, in which the minister briefed Austin on Israel’s “precise operation” in Beirut. 
     
            The readout said that Gallant described the operation as a “direct response” to Hezbollah’s attack on Majdal Shams that killed 12 children.
     
            Gallant also reiterated Israel’s commitment to defending itself, but said it “did not seek war.” 
     
        “Minister Gallant told the Secretary that the ties between Israel and the United States are central to Israel’s standing in the region and to deterring Iran and its proxies,” the readout said.
     
 
Some background: Israel said its strike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, who it blamed for the deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
     
            In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said “Israeli Air Force fighter jets eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organization’s most senior military commander” Fu’ad Shukr. At least three people were killed in the strike and 74 people were injured, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.
     
            Palestinians in Gaza have expressed grief and anger over the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. 
     
        “Ismail Haniyeh is the son of Gaza. He represents my entire people,” said Ahmad Al Nims, in an interview with a CNN stringer in Deir el-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, on Wednesday. 
     
 
            Gazan Abu Yasser Hassoun said the assassination had struck “like a thunderbolt” and described Haniyeh as a leader who united Palestinians. 
     
            Saleh Al Shunnar, who has been displaced from Jabalya in northern Gaza, said through tears: “We do not say that he is from Hamas or Fatah, but rather that he is a Palestinian leader, the son of a Palestinian father and a Palestinian mother. It was heart-breaking news for all of us in the Gaza Strip, throughout Palestine, outside Palestine, and in the diaspora.”
     
        “I know him closely… I sat with him many times,” said Al Shunnar. “He was always trying to reach national reconciliation.”
     
 
            Political analyst Amjad Al Shawwa called the assassination of “one of the most important Palestinian leaders” a “crime in every sense of the word.” 
     
            “It is clear that the occupation has a clear intention not to reach any calm, a ceasefire, or to stop the aggression,” Al Shawwa said. 
     
            Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.
     
            As the Middle East reels from the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, leaders have begun weighing in — with some condemning the killing and voicing alarm that it could escalate the regional conflict.
     
Here’s what they have said:
 
This post has been updated with more reactions to the death of Haniyeh.
 
            Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that Israel did not seek war but was “preparing for all possibilities.”
     
            In remarks published by his office, Gallant is said to have met with troops operating Israel’s Arrow air defense system and told them: 
     
        “The operation tonight in Beirut was precise and professional. We do not seek war, but we are preparing for all possibilities. As such, you must prepare accordingly, while we do our job at the higher levels.” 
     
 
            Israel has claimed responsibility for an attack on Beirut that killed Hezbollah’s military leader Fu’ad Shukr but has neither claimed nor denied the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
            Measures to protect Israeli athletes competing at the 2024 Paris Olympics are “relevant all the time,” a source told CNN when asked if the delegation’s security detail will ramp up amid increased tensions in the Middle East.
     
            On Wednesday, Hamas said its political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in the Iranian capital of Tehran, throwing the region into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase.
     
        “The issue [of security] is relevant all the time, and of course now. We trust our security forces and local security forces. Of course, for obvious reasons, we will not go into detail,” the source said.
     
 
            Israeli news website Ynet had reported that the Israel Security Agency (ISA), also known as Shin Bet, would bolster the delegation’s security. The newspaper did not cite its sources. 
     
Gaza war casts shadow: Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza has cast a shadow over this year’s Games, where 10,500 athletes from more than 200 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team are competing, according to the official website. 
     
            Earlier this year, Palestinian athletes participating in the Games told CNN they are haunted by the reality of war at home, where Israeli attacks have killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians.
     
            Israel will face a “harsh” and “painful response” from Iran for the assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement. 
     
            “Undoubtedly, this crime of the Zionist regime will face a harsh and painful response from the powerful and great front of the Resistance, especially Islamic Iran,” the statement said. 
     
            Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it does not respond to reports in foreign media. 
     
            The IRGC said Haniyeh was one of 110 foreign dignitaries invited by Iran to participate in the presidential inauguration ceremony of Masoud Pezeshkian. 
     
            Isaeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “pushing the region and the world to the brink of catastrophe,” former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif said Wednesday following the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
     
        “As the world is silently watching Israel’s genocide and repeated acts of international terrorism and aggression, Netanyahu is pushing the region and the world to the brink of catastrophe,” he wrote in a post on X.
     
 
            Zarif, a key negotiator of Iran’s nuclear deal with western powers and a close ally of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, warned that the killing would only strengthen the nation’s resolve to support the Palestinians.
     
            “The cowardly assassination of our guest will only strengthen our resolve to defend our territory and support the Palestinian people’s fight for their freedom,” he said, adding that it was “high time for the west to stop shielding Netanyahu’s madness and join the world in ending his suicidal chaos.”
     
            The death toll from an Israeli strike on southern Beirut that killed Hezbollah’s top military commander, Fu’ad Shukr on Tuesday has risen to at least four.
     
            Shukr is the most senior figure from the Iran-backed group to be killed in years and came just hours before the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh
     
            Another woman was announced dead on Wednesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Health in a statement. Earlier, the ministry said two children and a woman were killed in the blast.
     
            At least 74 others were injured in the strike.
     
            Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated while visiting Iran’s capital Tehran, just hours after Hezbollah’s top military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, was killed by an Israeli strike in Beirut, throwing the region into a new round of turmoil.
     
            While Israel claimed the strike on Shukr, it hasn’t done so for the Iran attack, with the military saying it “doesn’t respond to reports in the foreign media.” 
     
            There’s a lot we don’t yet know about this attack, including how it happened and how it happed on Iranian soil. 
     
            This is what we do know know so far:
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the United States was “not aware of or involved in” the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
            In an interview with CNA Singapore, Blinken reiterated his commitment to a ceasefire in Gaza and said he would not speculate on the impact of Haniyeh’s assassination, comments he first made earlier in the day at a news conference in Singapore, where he is on an official visit. 
     
        “Nothing takes away from the importance of — as I said a moment ago — getting to the ceasefire which is manifestly in the interests of the hostages and bringing them home, is manifestly in the interests of Palestinians who are suffering terribly every single day,” he said at the conference.“Children, women, men in Gaza who have been caught in this crossfire of Hamas’ making. It’s profoundly in the interests of trying to put things on a better path.”
     
 
            Blinken also said he would not speculate about whether this killing could cause further escalation: “because we simply don’t know.” 
     
The headline and post have been updated with more comments from Blinken in Singapore.
 
            Ismail Haniyeh will be buried in the Qatari capital of Doha on Friday after the Hamas political leader was assassinated in Iran, the militant group said in a statement.
     
            A funeral procession will be held in the Iranian capital of Tehran on Thursday, where state-affiliated media reported three days of public mourning.
     
            Haniyeh’s body will then be moved to Doha. Members of the public, Arab and Islamic leaders will attend the funeral, according to Hamas.
     
Ties to Qatar: In recent years Haniyeh lived in exile in Doha, which hosts the main Hamas political bureau. His assassination has sparked concern over the progress of negotiations, of which he was a key player.
     
            Qatari officials had been coordinating with Washington and Egypt to secure a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza.
     
The post was updated with more details on Haniyeh’s connection to Doha.
 
            There are many questions we still have about Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination, including how the Hamas political leader was killed and how this happened on Iranian soil.
     
            For now, we know that Iranian state media says he was killed while visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s president. Haniyeh was staying at a residence for veterans in a district in north Tehran, but the exact location is not known.
     
            Iranian reports say he was killed by an “airborne guided projectile” – but we don’t yet know what that means. Was it a missile fired from a jet or a drone loaded with an explosive?
     
            Unusually, no images of the aftermath of the attack have emerged, either in Iranian state media or on social channels, which would help us answer that question.
     
            Our reporters are reviewing all available information and will bring you the latest as soon as they have it.
     
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a security assessment in Tel-Aviv later today, an Israeli official told CNN. 
     
            The security cabinet will meet after the assessment, the official said. 
     
Some context: Hamas has accused Israel of carrying out the strike in Tehran that killed its political leader Ismail Haniyeh. Israel’s military said it “doesn’t respond to reports in the foreign media.”
     
            “How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?” 
     
            That was the response from Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a mediator on the Israel-Hamas talks, to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on X. 
     
        “Political assassinations & continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?,” he wrote.“Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life,” he added. 
     
 
            Qatar’s capital Doha hosts the main Hamas political bureau. 
     
            The assassination of Hamas’ political chief could “complicate mediation talks” aimed at negotiating a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN. 
     
            The source said that Ismail Haniyeh was “instrumental” in achieving certain breakthroughs and, along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, was a “key decision maker.”
     
        “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source said. “At this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on ceasefire talks.”
     
 
Impact on ceasefire talks: Haniyeh had shown a willingness to reach an agreement if Israel withdrew from Gaza. Key mediators have so far been unable to succeed in talks for the release of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have ravaged the besieged enclave and killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians.
     
            Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran sees it as its duty to avenge the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh because he was assassinated on Iranian soil. 
     
        “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Khamenei said, referring to Israel.  “We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.” 
     
 
            New Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has paid tribute to Ismail Haniyeh, whom he called the “brave leader of the Palestinian resistance,” after the Hamas political bureau chief was assassinated. 
     
        “Today, Iran is mourning its sharer of sorrows and joys, the proud companion of the path of resistance, the brave leader of the Palestinian resistance, the martyr of al-Quds, Haj Ismail Haniyeh. Yesterday I raised his victorious hand and today I have to carry him on my shoulders to bury,” Pezeshkian said.“The bond between the two proud nations of Iran and Palestine will be stronger than before, and the path of resistance and defense of the oppressed will be followed stronger than ever.” 
     
 
            He said Iran would defend its territorial integrity and make the culprits regret their attack.
     
            The Palestinian militant group said Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli “strike” on his residence.
     
            The Israeli military declined to comment, though senior officials launched a relentless bombing campaign on Gaza, with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas after October 7.
     
            Before he was killed, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, as well as to hold talks with Iranian leaders.
     
            Iran has been a key supporter of Hamas.
     
            Haniyeh, a key interlocutor in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations, was in parliament on Tuesday for the formal swearing-in. 
     
            The head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military, and Iran’s former President Hassan Rouhani were among the attendees.
     
            The assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh may have “totally changed the dynamic” between Iran-backed proxies and Israel, said Firas Maksad, Senior Fellow and Senior Director for Strategic Outreach at the Middle East Institute.
     
        “There’s a great possibility that this will see an orchestrated region-wide campaign that brings the various Iranian-sponsored militias from Iraq, from Yemen, from Lebanon, and maybe even Tehran itself in a direct response on Israel,” Maksad told CNN.
     
 
            The consecutive deaths of leaders from Iran-backed groups has been unprecedented and is a potential notch closer to a region-wide conflict, he added.
     
        “But in all likelihood, we’re looking at several dark days ahead in which the region will be at the precipice of an all-out war.”
     
 
            Israel has also demonstrated in the past 24 hours that it has an “extraordinary capability” in terms of “actionable intelligence” to assassinate senior figures of Iranian proxies, and present a tactical victory for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Maksad said.
     
            In response to reporters’ question on Haniyeh’s killing, Israel’s military said it does not respond to reports in foreign media, though senior officials have previously vowed to eliminate Hamas in response to the group’s October 7 attack. 
     
            Tensions in the Middle East skyrocketed this week after two key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders were killed in targeted strikes, stoking fears of an escalation in the war in Gaza.
     
            Hamas said Israel killed its Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in the Iranian capital Iran on Wednesday, while Israel on Tuesday claimed an attack in the Lebanese capital Beirut, who it blamed for an attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday that killed 12 Arab Druze children.
     
            Experts say the assassinations cast an ominous shadow on hopes of a ceasefire hostage deal and stifle any progress toward de-escalation between Israel and its Iran-backed enemies.
     
            Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, told CNN that negotiations were already deadlocked before Haniyeh’s assassination, and that the new developments only put the lives of hostages still held captive in danger.
     
        It is unclear how much longer Qatari and Egyptian mediators will allow themselves “to be played by Israel and Hamas,” Baskin said, adding that it may be time for mediators to put a deal on the table and ask parties to “take it or leave it, and if they leave it, perhaps it’s time for them to leave the parties to themselves.”
     
 
            The strikes bring fears of an all-out regional war to new heights, especially as Iran is now pressured to respond to an attack that took place on its own soil, experts said. 
     
            When Israel killed top Iranian military commanders in an airstrike on the country’s consulate building in Damascus, Syria, Iran responded with more than 300 projectiles fired directly at the Jewish state.
     
            The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military, will publish a second statement on the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, according to state media.
     
            “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will publish its second statement about the assassination of Martyr Ismail Haniyeh in an hour,” the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
     
            Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, in an assassination that could further destabilize the Middle East and jeopardize Israel-Hamas negotiations. 
     
Here’s the latest:
 
This post has been updated with an updated translation of Hamas’ initial statement on Haniyeh’s killing.
 
            More details are emerging about where, when and how Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed.
     
            Haniyeh was attacked in Tehran using an “airborne guided projectile,” state-run news agency IRNA said. The attack occurred around 2 a.m. local time. 
     
            Haniyeh was in Iran for the Iranian president’s inauguration, and was staying in one of the residences for veterans in north Tehran, state-affiliated news outlet Fars said. 
     
            IRNA said further investigations were underway to determine the details of the operation and the position from which the projectile was fired.
     
            Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa has condemned the assassination of Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA.
     
            The prime minister also “called on the factions, forces and the sons of our Palestinian people to further national unity and steadfastness in the face of the occupation and its crimes,” WAFA reported.
     
            Mustafa had been appointed in April to replace former Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who resigned in February along with his government amid pressure to reform as the war in Gaza raged on.
     
            The precise details of what happened at around 1.45 a.m. in Tehran, which led to the death of Ismail Haniyeh, will dictate what comes next. Or more precisely the details that Tehran chooses to present as its narrative.
     
            It is clearly a grave violation of their sovereignty and the supposed security bubble of the Iranian capital, however the attack occurred. Haniyeh was their guest, and their role as a regional power is eroded if they are unable to guarantee the simple safety of visiting allies. 
     
            But Iran has stomached comparable violations in the past, more specifically when non-Iranians were killed. The death of their leading nuclear scientist, Iranian Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was met with limited immediate wrath in 2020.
     
            The truth is Iran’s options are limited and none of them are great.
     
            It is clear Tehran is reluctant to launch its most ferocious proxy, Hezbollah, into a full-scale war with Israel from Lebanon. Putting aside the huge humanitarian horror such a conflict would cause for Lebanese and Israelis alike, Hezbollah remain a powerful card that Tehran probably gets to play just once. And so they must choose when they do so carefully.
     
            Iran has also tried an all-out attack on Israel before, in April, after senior Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders were killed in an Israeli strike on Damascus, Syria. In short, the 300 drones and missiles fired – unprecedentedly from Iran directly at Israel – just didn’t get through. It failed. Their response will both define their role as a regional power, but also risk that slipping. A stealthy, asymmetric strike, weeks from now, may not fix the damage done to their position.
     
            Yet still, red lines were again crossed, and another rung on the ladder of escalation has been climbed.
     
            The raging question of the next 24 hours, as Iran fashions its narrative of how this major humiliation came to be, is what remaining steps are there on this well-trodden ladder, and what is at its peak?

            Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov called the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh “an absolutely unacceptable political assassination,” according to Russian state media RIA Novosti.
     
        “This is all very wrong,” he said, according to RIA Novosti. “This is an absolutely unacceptable political assassination, and it will lead to further escalation of tension.”
     
 
            Moscow has previously criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza and called for a ceasefire.
     
            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but if Israel were to be attacked, the US would help defend it.
     
        “You saw us do that in April, you can expect to see us do that again,” he said.“But, we don’t want to see any of that happen. We’re going to work hard to make sure that we’re doing things to help take the temperature down and address issues through diplomatic means.” 
     
 
            Austin said he is aware of reports that Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran, but he had no further comment.
     
            Austin said he has not spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, in the last 24 hours.
     
            Asked about growing tensions in the Middle East, Austin said “what we’ve seen along the border, the northern border with Israel, overtime that’s been a concern of ours.”
     
        “Again, we’re going to do everything we can to keep things from turning into a broader conflict in the region.”
     
 
            Any Hamas retaliation to Ismail Haniyeh’s killing is unlikely to come from Gaza, analyst Brigadier General (Res.) Assaf Orion told CNN.
     
            “Hamas may struggle to produce an outstanding retaliation from Gaza, so perhaps they will try to attack in the (West Bank) or from it into Israel,” said the senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies of Tel Aviv University, and director of the Diane & Guilford Glazer Israel-China Policy Center.
     
        “Abroad is also an option, either on overseas targets or attacking from Lebanon/Syria.”
     
 
            He said that the targeting of two leaders in two days from Iran-backed regional proxies meant Israel could face a wider regional response. 
     
            Israel said yesterday its strike in Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, who it blamed for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children.  
     
        “The combination of Shukr and (Haniyeh), executed in both Beirut and Tehran, increase the likelihood of an Axis response – adding Iran and other proxy attacks to the menu,” he said.
     
 
            We have more reactions coming in from Hamas over the killing of its political leader Ismail Haniyeh. 
     
        “This assassination by the Israeli occupation of Brother Haniyeh is a grave escalation that aims to break the will of Hamas,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.
     
 
            He said Hamas would continue on its current path, adding: “We are confident of victory.”
     
            In separate quotes run by Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV, Abu Zuhri said a “moment of truth has come”.
     
        “This occupation must realize that it has opened fire on itself, not on Ismail Haniyeh,” he said, adding that Hamas was ready to pay a high price “for the sake of Jerusalem and liberation.”
     
 
            Abu Zuhri also called on “the rulers of the nation and its youth to rise up with all their efforts and strength in every field and every location,” adding that “this assassination will not achieve the goals of the occupation and will not push Hamas to surrender.”
     
            Palestinian factions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have called for a general strike and protests on Wednesday over the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.
     
        “We declare a comprehensive strike and march in anger to the confrontation areas, confirming that the assassination of the great national leader Ismail Haniyeh is part of the Zionist state’s terrorism, war of extermination, destruction, and killing in light of the international community’s failure to stop the war and hold the occupation accountable for its crimes,” the National and Islamic forces in Palestine said.
     
 
            In a separate statement, the student movement at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank issued a similar call.
     
        “We announce to you, our students, that Wednesday is a day of general strike. We also call on students to head to the university campus to participate in the demonstration.”
     
 
            Haniyeh was killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, Iranian state media reported on Wednesday, citing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military. Hamas said Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike on his residence.
     
            The killing comes at a fraught time for the Middle East, with escalating confrontations between Israel and Hezbollah threatening to expand into a wider regional war, and as Hamas battles Israel’s military in Gaza.
     
            Ismail Haniyeh has been part of Hamas for decades, in recent years running the militant group’s political operations from exile, and emerging as one of its most visible leaders during the war with Israel in Gaza.
     
            As Hamas’s political leader, he was a key interlocutor with international mediators during stalled hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, following the group’s October 7 attack on Israel.
     
Discussions with mediators: He had shown willingness to reach an agreement if Israel withdrew from Gaza – saying in May that the group was “still keen” to strike a deal with mediators, but that any proposal would have to cease fighting in the enclave permanently.
     
            At the time, he said their demands aimed to stop “the aggression against our people, which is a fundamental and logical position that lays the foundation for a more stable future.”
     
            In response, Israel has called those demands “unacceptable,” with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to keep fighting until Hamas was destroyed – leaving negotiations at a standstill as both sides traded blame.
     
            As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement.
     
        Given his role in negotiations, Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid on Wednesday.

            Ismail Haniyeh’s death sends “a very strong message,” said Matthew Levitt, Fromer-Wexler Senior Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
     
            Hamas said Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike on his residence in Tehran.
     
        “I think the Israelis are going to great ends to make clear that it’s no longer going to be safe for the leaders of terrorist groups to walk around freely and in countries that provides them a safe haven, while they are promoting the killing of innocent [people],” Levitt told CNN.
     
 
            The death of Hamas political leader Haniyeh came just a day after Israel said its strike in Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr. A senior Lebanese government official told CNN Shukr survived. 
     
            Iran has spent years investing in regional proxy groups, informally known as the “Axis of Resistance” — an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance — supplying them with money, weapons, and training as Tehran has sought to broaden its influence across the Middle East.
     
            Levitt added that it has been “a very bad day for the Islamic resistance and its axis” as Israel ramps up its attacks on Iran-backed proxy group leaders.
     
Some context: The reported deaths of the two leaders of different Iran-backed militant groups are stoking already high fears that escalating tensions could spiral into all-out conflict in the region.
     
This post has been updated with an updated translation of Hamas’ initial statement on Haniyeh’s killing.
 
            Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has condemned the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, according to the WAFA news agency.
     
        “President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas strongly condemned the assassination of the head of the Hamas movement, the great leader Ismail Haniyeh, and considered it a cowardly act and a dangerous development. His Excellency called on the masses and forces of our people to unite, be patient and steadfast in the face of the Israeli occupation,” WAFA reported.
     
 
            The Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Hussein Al-Sheikh, also denounced the killing in a separate statement.
     
        “We strongly denounce and condemn the assassination of the head of the Political Bureau, the national leader, Ismail Haniyeh. We consider it a cowardly act, this pushes us to remain more steadfast in the face of the occupation, and the necessity of achieving the unity of the Palestinian forces and factions,” he said.
     
 
            The killing of Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, “will not pass in vain,” said Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of the group’s political bureau.
     
            “The assassination of leader Ismail Haniyeh was a cowardly act and will not pass in vain,” Marzouk said.
     
            The death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh is the “first most significant Israeli operation since October 7,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid.
     
            The Israeli military told CNN they “don’t respond to reports in the foreign media,” after Iranian state media reported Haniyeh’s death.
     
            While Haniyeh is not militarily significant, he is in charge of the group’s international relations and is the key interlocutor with Egyptian and Qatari mediators on the hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, Ravid said.
     
        “His assassination will have significant influence on those negotiations,” he said.
     
 
            The Israeli government sees Haniyeh as one of those responsible for Hamas’ October 7 attack, according to Ravid, and Israeli authorities have vowed to hunt down those responsible for the attack 10 months ago that has now embroiled the Middle East in conflict.
     
        “This assassination is, in a way, just a matter of when, not a matter of if,” Ravid said.
     
 
            Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran, according to Hamas and Iranian media, was a longtime political leader of the militant group.
     
            A Hamas official said the group is “ready to pay various prices,” after its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran. 
     
        Sami Abu Zuhri said: “We are engaged in an open war to liberate Jerusalem and we are ready to pay various prices.”
     
 
            There have been popular calls for Palestinians to launch a general strike after news of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh’s death, Hamas-linked Al-Aqsa TV reported.
     
            The killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh is under investigation and the results will be announced later today, Iranian state media reported, citing a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
     
            The IRGC, an elite wing of the Iranian military, offered condolences to “the heroic Palestinian nation, the Muslim Ummah (community), fighters of the resistance front and the noble Iranian nation over the martyrdom of the senior Palestinian resistance leader,” state media reported. 
     
            Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
     
            The White House has seen the reports of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh being killed in Iran, a spokesperson said, but declined to immediately comment further.
     
            The Israeli military told CNN they “don’t respond to reports in the foreign media,” after Iranian state media reported that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran.
     
            In a separate statement, Hamas said Haniyeh was killed in what it said was an Israeli raid on his residence in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of the Iranian president.
     
Haniyeh was a longtime senior leader in the group, after first joining Hamas in the late 1980s and climbing the ranks in the following decades. 
     
            Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran, according to Hamas and Iranian media, was a longtime political leader of the militant group.
     
            The 62-year-old was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising.
     
            As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004, then being named the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority in 2006.
     
            By 2017 he had become chief of the group — and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States soon after. 
     
            Over the years, he participated in peace talks with former US President Jimmy Carter, and met with other world leaders including the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian earlier this year.
     
            In April, Israeli airstrikes killed three of Haniyeh’s sons and four of his grandchildren, according to Hamas.
     
            At the time, Haniyeh – who was based in Qatar – insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks.
     
        “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said.
     
 
            Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in Tehran, Iranian state media Press TV reported on Wednesday, citing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) —an elite wing of the Iranian military.
     
            In a separate statement, Hamas said Haniyeh was killed alongside his bodyguard in what it said was an Israeli raid on his residence after he participated in the inauguration of the Iranian president.
     
            It is not clear when Haniyeh was killed.
