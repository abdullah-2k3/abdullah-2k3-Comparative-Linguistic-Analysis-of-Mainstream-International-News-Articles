Instead, he volunteered at a hospital to help those who couldn’t run – even if they wanted to. On October 1, Jawad, a 56-year-old American citizen, father of four and cherished figure in the Dearborn, Michigan, community, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, his family says. The tragedy attests to fears of the conflict spilling over into the wider region being realized as Israel expands its assault. “We are honored by my father’s sacrifice. In his last days, he chose to stay near the main hospital in Nabatieh to help the elderly, disabled, injured, and those who simply couldn’t financially afford to flee,” his daughter, Nadine Jawad, wrote in a statement on Facebook . ”He served as their guardian, provided them with food, mattresses, and other comforts, and anonymously paid off their debts. I would often ask him if he was scared, and he repeatedly told me that we should not be scared because he is doing what he loves the most: helping others live in the land he loved the most.” Residents run for cover following an Israeli airstrike in Dahiyeh, Beirut, Lebanon, Friday, Oct. 4, 2024.

CNN has reached out to the Israeli military, which said they could not comment without being given the exact coordinates and time of the strike that killed Jawad. Israel has pummeled Lebanon with an unprecedented airstrike campaign, killing over 1,400 people, injuring nearly 7,500 others and displacing more than a million people from their homes , according to the Lebanese health ministry. The bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, according to the conflict monitoring group Airwars. In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated the Iran-backed group a terrorist organization. Israel and Hezbollah have been locked in tit-for-tat escalation since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a deadly attack in Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli officials. In the ensuing war in Gaza, Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive has so far killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children , according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Militant groups from Lebanon to Yemen – as well as Iran – have responded by launching attacks on Israel, which has responded in kind, heightening fears of a wider regional war .

Lebanese officials have accused Israel of indiscriminately bombing populated civilian areas, including the capital Beirut. CNN teams in Beirut this week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. As a result, the death toll in Lebanon continues to rise, with a fifth of its population now displaced. But for Jawad, it was the people – not the geopolitics – that mattered most. “In his last moments, my father was calm. He emphasized our collective responsibility to help the oppressed. Even as he witnessed destruction from the missiles falling around him, his certainty in the importance of caring for community – in any and every capacity possible – remained,” his daughter wrote. “Our father’s message was clear: stop arming, aiding, and abetting our oppression and start caring for the people struggling for their freedom and dignity.” An American community in mourning Jawad’s killing has ignited an outpouring of love and fond memories in Dearborn, home to the largest Arab American and Lebanese communities in the US. In the days since his death, friends, family, community members and local officials have posted tributes online to the man they say was beloved for his selflessness and dedication to both his American and Lebanese communities. Many recall him as a kind, generous person who didn’t like to make a fuss out of his good deeds. He was known for saving money each year to return to Lebanon and help people, feeding them and paying off strangers’ debts without them ever knowing it was him, friends said. Jawad was also the founder of the nonprofit Lebanese Diaspora Relief Org, which provides families in Lebanon who are in need with food and medical supplies. “There are some people in this world who when you meet them, sincerity shines out from them,” Hamzah Raza, Jawad’s friend, said in a statement on Facebook. “He was someone who loved people. And loved helping people. “We applaud him on leaving this world as a martyr,” Raza said. “Yet we are sad for humanity. We are sad at the oppression of the Israeli state. We are sad that an American was killed by (Israel) with weapons given to him by his own government.” Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed in the West Bank Wednesday, the network said. 
Bureau chief Waleed Al Omari wept on air as he announced the news.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said she was shot in the head by a live bullet in Jenin, and confirmed her death shortly afterwards. 
A second journalist, Ali Al-Samudi, was also shot and is in stable condition, the ministry said.
The Israel Defense Forces said Israeli security forces had been operating in the area to arrest suspects in terrorist activities, said both suspects and Israeli forces fired, and acknowledged the possibility that journalists were hit. Facebook/Shireen Abu Akleh Related article Israel reveals US probe into Shireen Abu Akleh’s death but says it ‘will not cooperate’ American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee National Executive Director Abed Ayoub, who is Lebanese and from Dearborn, told CNN that Jawad was a well-respected member of the community who contributed to its betterment every day. “He’s leaving behind an incredible legacy, and someone that’s going to truly be missed, somebody that really embodies the best of Lebanon and the best of Dearborn in the US,” Ayoub told CNN. “It’s a tragic loss for the community, a tragic loss for his family, for his parents, for all of us in the city.” US Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Debbie Dingell of Michigan are among the many who paid tribute to Jawad and his family. Other Lebanese American families in Dearborn also are grieving the loss of loved ones back home, including Ali Dabaja, who said at least five family members were recently killed by Israeli airstrikes in Bint Jbeil, a city in southern Lebanon. His cousin Batoul Dabaja-Saad, her husband and their three children – the youngest 8 years old – were buried beneath the rubble of their home, he said. Dabaja, who is close friends with the Jawad family and says he is heartbroken over his killing, said the Dearborn community is in “collective mourning” and that every death – including every Palestinian killed by Israel since October 7 – has caused the community the same measure of pain. “These are all lives that mean something to us, every single one of those human beings, those Arabs, those brown faces, have been allowed to die, but they had stories and ambitions and every single time one of those lives are lost for us, it compounds our tragedy,” Dabaja told CNN. “With each death, a fire inside of us continues to burn, and it burns stronger.” Smoke rises following Israeli strikes in Rafah, Gaza, on May 28. Hatem Khaled/Reuters Related article US releases $3.5 billion to Israel to spend on US weapons and military equipment, months after Congress appropriated With their sorrow comes anger and despair – and a sense that US leaders are not listening to their pleas for an end to the violence that has claimed the lives of so many loved ones. “We don’t just need soft words and words of diplomacy,” Dabaja said. “We need action, we need change in policy, policy that says no to war, a policy that says no to foreign funding of wars.” The US State Department confirmed to CNN on Friday that Jawad was a US citizen, not a legal permanent resident as spokesperson Matthew Miller initially said on Wednesday. Miller’s initial remarks disclaiming Jawad’s citizenship was criticized by the Arab American community and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which told CNN the rushed statements hurt the community and undermined the extent of Jawad’s loss. “We are aware and alarmed of reports of the death of Kamel Jawad, who we have confirmed is a US citizen,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN, adding that they “are working to understand the circumstances of the incident.” “As we have noted repeatedly, it is a moral and strategic imperative that Israel take all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm,” the spokesperson said. “Any loss of civilian life is a tragedy.” ‘Your duty is to the poor’ The Jawad family has denied all requests to speak to the media. In an Instagram exchange with a journalist, Nadine Jawad cited the “dehumanizing” coverage of Arabs and Arab Americans. Jawad said in her statement on Facebook her father “never viewed himself as a savior,” only that he was “part of a much larger movement of people who refuse to stay silent in the face of oppression.” He dedicated his life – and ultimately sacrificed it – for his beloved Lebanese community, in Lebanon and here in the US. But his American citizenship, his daughter says, does not make his life any more valuable than the lives of the thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes. “His service and dedication to helping those in need is not over,” she wrote, vowing to continue his work. Before he was killed, Jawad sent his children a simple voice note: “Peace be upon you. Everything is ok, but if something happens to me your duty is to the poor.” The family has already launched a fundraiser in Jawad’s honor, collecting more than $88,000 to help feed and aid displaced Lebanese civilians through his nonprofit organization. “Their death isn’t just a death, it isn’t just a loss, it is a message,” Dabaja said. “His story is a story that needs to be told to the whole world.” CNN’s Jennifer Hansler and Kara Fox contributed to this report."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) this week launched the operation following intelligence that it said showed “the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.” In practice, the renewed offensive has been far more widespread than the Jabalya refugee camp . Four sources have told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not adopted the siege proposal put forward by retired general Giora Eiland. But the operation currently underway bears resemblance to the plan presented by Eiland in a public video, and in private to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. A former senior military official who is aware of the Israeli government and security leadership’s thinking – though not directly involved in decision-making – told CNN that the cabinet had adopted “a version of” Eiland’s proposal, which has come to be known as “The General’s Plan.” Eiland told CNN the claim was “quite true” but said there were significant differences between his proposal and what was being implemented on the ground. The operation comes at a time when the Israeli government is known to be considering several plans to reset the war in Gaza.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters Related live-story The latest on the wars in the Middle East Eiland last month proposed forcing all civilians out of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, and then cutting off all supplies to the area. The goal, he said, was to force a reset in the war and upend Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s calculus. “The reality today in Gaza is that Sinwar is really not stressed,” he said in a video released at the time. The former military official who spoke to CNN said that “what was adopted [by the government] was the need to do more in Gaza, to change the way Sinwar is thinking. It was adopted without any way that may be conceived a violation of international law.” Eiland’s proposal had no plan to allow Gazan civilians to return to northern Gaza, Retired Major-General Gershon Hacohen, who was involved in its drafting, told CNN. That situation would seem certain to draw accusations of ethnic cleansing, something that has already been raised by academics like Omer Bartov, an Israeli-born professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University in Rhode Island. Flyer issued by the IDF warning residents of northern Gaza to move south. Obtained by CNN Eiland told CNN by text message that the cabinet is “indeed acting on my recommendation with the intention of taking control of the northern Gaza Strip, but I recommended implementing a siege (after evacuating the civilians) and stopping the entry of supplies into this area. None of this is happening.” On Monday, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered all Palestinians in Gaza’s northern-most communities – Beit Hanoun, Jabalya, and Beit Lahia – to leave and relocate to Al Mawasi, an Israel-declared “humanitarian area” in southern Gaza that has nonetheless come under intense aerial bombardment for months. The military on Saturday added additional mandatory evacuation zones, dropping flyers and posting on X, ordering people in the Nazla area and more areas of Jabalya to leave. The military “is operating with great force against terrorist organizations and will continue to do so for an extended period,” Avichay Adraee said on X. “You must evacuate the area immediately via Salah al-Din Street to the humanitarian zone.” Most intense action Supplies of food into northern Gaza, already meager, appear to have almost entirely stopped since the Israeli military began its renewed operation there this week. The World Food Programme told CNN on Friday that no food trucks had entered northern Gaza since the start of the month. “Virtually the entire area is under evacuation orders, and thousands of families have been forced to flee amid intense airstrikes and military operations on the ground,” WFP said in a statement on Wednesday . “With the main aid crossings into northern Gaza closed and WFP-partner kitchens forced to shut down, WFP is no longer able to distribute food in any form to families that desperately need it.” CNN asked the IDF for comment on aid deliveries being blocked. Netanyahu told a closed-door Knesset committee last month that the Generals’ Plan “makes a lot of sense,” according to national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate. He said that it was one of several ideas being considered to change the course of the war in Gaza, which is now in its second year. Palestinians in northern Gaza say that this week has brought some of the most intense military action of the war. Many, wary of repeated orders over the past year to move to areas of Gaza that then themselves come under attack, are ignoring the order. “Anyone who wants to leave the north to Gaza wants death,” Jabalya resident Mohammad Ibrahim told CNN by phone this week. Palestinians fleeing the renewed operation have been shot at as they evacuate, according to residents there and footage shared with CNN documenting their journey. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Palestinians flee with the few belongings they can carry following an Israeli attack on Jabalya camp on October 8.

They are working at minimum capacity and are exhausted. Even the safe places are bombed with shells and rockets.” Dr. Hussam Abu Saifiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said the facility was informed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Tuesday that medical staff and patients must evacuate the hospital “within 24 hours.” They were not told where to go, he said. Al Awda and the Indonesian hospitals have also been ordered to leave, according to local officials. Hospital officials say Israel’s intense bombardment of the area makes it impossible to leave safely. Meanwhile, seven attempts this week by the World Health Organization to reach northern Gaza were “denied or impeded,” Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday. “The team was unable to carry out the medical evacuation of critical patients from Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals to Al-Ahli and Al-Shifa, due to delays of over 10 hours at checkpoints,” he said in a statement on X.

Fierce border clashes suggest a win won’t be easy,"The reality on the ground indicates Israel may be preparing for the possibility of a much bigger war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. If so, the fight could get bloody.","Oct 12, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Ivana Kottasová,Middle East,"Northern Israel CNN — The Ziv hospital in northern Israel is on high alert. Non-urgent operations are on hold, staff have been asked to consider donating blood when needed, and all patients – including newborns in the maternity unit – have been moved underground. The expectation here is clear: If Israel ends up sending more troops to southern Lebanon, it could get bloody. “We have been in a war situation for the past year, but after the army entered into Lebanon, our services and all of the staff are ready for, unfortunately, the next wave of casualties,” the hospital’s director, Salman Zarka, told CNN. Ziv Medical Center is the only hospital in the area and the closest to Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, as well as the occupied Golan Heights. The hospital in Safed has been receiving people injured in cross-border fire for months, including children hurt in the deadly attack on Majdal Shams in July. “When you have combat on the ground, usually you have more wounded and, unfortunately, dead soldiers. I hope it will not happen, (but) we have to be ready,” Zarka, an IDF reservist and a former commander of the IDF’s Medical Services Center, added. When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a ground operation against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon last week, its commanders insisted any action across the border would be “limited” in both geographical scope and duration. But the reality on the ground indicates it might be preparing for the possibility of a much bigger war. Prof. Salman Zarka, director of the Ziv Medical Center, told CNN the hospital is ready for the possibility that it may start receiving more casualties. Ivana Kottasova/CNN The IDF said on Tuesday that units from four divisions are now fighting in southern Lebanon. The force doesn’t disclose its troop numbers, but each division is thought to consist of some 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers. Israel has also broadened evacuation orders to roughly a quarter of Lebanese territory, with more than 1.2 million people now displaced, according to the United Nations. Daniel Sobelman, an international security expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the IDF has remained intentionally vague about the scope of the operation. “Initially, Israel said this is just to make sure that all the (Hezbollah) infrastructure on the other side of the fence is destroyed,” he said. “But the thing that we all know is that this infrastructure doesn’t stop a few hundreds of meters or even a few kilometers in, it stretches out all the way to Beirut, into northern Lebanon, into the Beqaa Valley. If Israel really wants to clean up that area, then we would be looking at a very long-term operation,” he said.

The 2006 conflict is known in Israel as the “Second Lebanon War” even though it was the third time Israel publicly said it entered Lebanon’s territory, after invading it in 1978 and 1982. The war ended in a stalemate after 34 days, after some 1,100 Lebanese and about 170 Israelis, including 120 soldiers, were killed. For the Lebanese, the current conflict is already bloodier than the last war. More than 1,500 people have been killed in the country since September 16, when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of Lebanese health ministry statements. Several international organizations have criticized Israel for the escalation. The UN said last month that “while Hezbollah has fired more missiles indiscriminately, forcing thousands of Israelis to leave their homes, Israel has escalated its indiscriminate and large-scale airstrikes across Lebanon,” warning that the increased violence “adds to the instability.” And while the casualties on the Israeli side are much lower and mostly limited to military, they are not insignificant: At least 14 IDF soldiers have been killed. Zarka told CNN there has also been a steady stream of injured soldiers coming to the hospital since the ground operation started – the hospital received well over 100 in just the first few days, he said. Both the IDF and Hezbollah said there had been fierce clashes and several cross-border attacks in the past week.

At the same time, Hezbollah continues to fire rockets into Israel on a regular basis. And while most of the projectiles are intercepted by Israeli air defense systems, some slip through. On Wednesday, two Israeli civilians were killed when a rocket struck Kiryat Shmona, a town a few miles away from the border. Several Israeli soldiers who are currently fighting in Lebanon told CNN the open, mountainous terrain where their enemy is at home makes the operation difficult. One soldier, who was deployed to Gaza from October to March and in July and August and who is now fighting in southern Lebanon, said the war along the northern border is very different to what he experienced in Gaza. “The challenge is not that Hezbollah is more equipped by Iran or have more training. The challenge is the switch in the head from months of fighting in an urban territory versus fighting in an open area territory,” he said, adding that even the most basic maneuvers – including the way soldiers move around in a column – are completely different. Since IDF troops are not allowed to speak to the media without official permission, CNN is not publishing the name of the soldier. Guerilla warfare On paper, Israel’s army is far superior to Hezbollah’s militia fighters. It has more advanced and sophisticated weapons, a significantly higher number of troops, better intelligence and stronger allies. But the soldier who spoke with CNN said these advantages don’t count for much in the type of fighting that is going on in the hills of southern Lebanon, where superior weaponry counts for less. Sobelman, the security expert, said Israel had a similar experience in the 2006 w ar with Hezbollah. UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix speaks during a UN Security Council meeting on October 10, 2024. UNTV Related article Peacekeepers’ safety in Lebanon ‘in jeopardy,’ UN official warns after Israeli fire injures two “Hezbollah were up against the strongest military in the Middle East, there were literally hundreds of Israeli air raids per day, and artillery, and all the capabilities that a modern, advanced military has to offer. And they were not defeated. They survived. And throughout the entire Israeli offensive, Hezbollah was able to fire hundreds of rockets into Israel every day,” he said. Sobelman said that after the 2006 fiasco, Israel had spent almost two decades preparing for its next confrontation with Hezbollah. “The assumption has been that the next war is going to be with Hezbollah, not Hamas. No one on Earth probably imagined a scenario along the lines of October 7. Instead, Israel invested almost two decades preparing itself for what we’ve seen over the past several weeks – and in terms of Israel’s intelligence penetration of Hezbollah, it’s astounding.” But while Israel has managed to kill several of Hezbollah’s top figures and inflicted much damage on the group’s rank-and-file members using exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, as well as airstrikes that have also claimed civilian lives, the IDF continues to face fierce resistance in southern Lebanon. Because Hezbollah has been preparing for this war as well. “The expectation is that Israel will win this war without paying too high a price. But that’s never the case with guerilla warfare,” Sobelman said, adding that Israel is fighting on a territory that Hezbollah knows much better and that its opponent is determined to inflict as many losses on the IDF as possible. “They’re entrenched in underground facilities and they’re playing a defensive game,” he said of Hezbollah’s fighters. “And it doesn’t matter how many of them you kill, still (in a guerilla war) the weaker side ultimately wins by imposing a sustained accumulation of costs.” He said this is exactly what happened in 2006, when Israel was not able to achieve a decisive victory despite its superior capabilities. While the IDF has not provided any details about how its troops died in Lebanon, Hezbollah has claimed to have successfully ambushed Israeli soldiers on several occasions, saying it killed and injured a number of them. Soldiers, including several visibly injured, are seen at the emergency department’s reception desk at the Ziv Medical Center. Ivana Kottasova/CNN ‘Bring it on’ Despite the challenges, the IDF seems determined to push on. Speaking on Wednesday, IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Israel would “strike Hezbollah with intensity, without allowing them any respite or recovery.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went as far as warning the Lebanese people that they face falling “into the abyss of a long war” because of Hezbollah. Israeli soldiers on the ground seem prepared for a long war. “I wish we didn’t have to expand the scope of the ground incursion… but if we have to fight so that the children can go to kindergarten and not be afraid of a missile strike, we will do that too,” the soldier who spoke with CNN said, adding that he and his fellow fighters were “stronger than ever, ready and determined.” This sentiment seemed prevalent among the dozens of Israeli soldiers CNN encountered while reporting from around the border after the IDF announced the ground operation. Most troops appeared in high spirits in the days after the ground operation began. When asked about Hezbollah specifically, one group responded by calling out “Bring it on!” But some in Israeli society are not so sure going into Lebanon is a good idea. Several civilians living in the northern parts of Israel told CNN last week that they fear a ground war could become very deadly . And some, like Itamar Greenberg, are prepared to go to prison in protest against the war. The 18-year-old is a conscientious objector, or “refusenik.” Conscription is mandatory for most Israeli citizens, men and women, and only a few young people dare to refuse on moral basis. A handful end up in prison each year. IDF “refusenik” Itamar Greenberg is set to begin serving his third prison sentence next week. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Greenberg has spent 60 days in prison so far – 30 days after his initial draft rejection and 30 days after he was called up a second time and refused again. CNN spoke to him in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, four days before he was scheduled to go back to prison after refusing to enlist for the third time. Before the IDF attempted to draft him, Greenberg was an activist campaigning against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and against increasingly violent attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages. Some of these protests turned violent after Israeli security authorities got involved – clearly leaving a mark on Greenberg. When a police car drove past, its sirens on, he flinched and looked around with worry. Greenberg told CNN he had refused to enlist in the army in protest of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, its war in Gaza and, most recently, its operation in Lebanon. “The war in Lebanon started when I was in jail. I joked that I didn’t even have the time to refuse all their f**king wars,” he noted. He was born in 2006, the year of the Second Lebanon War – a coincidence that is not lost on him. “The first (Israeli) soldiers have now been killed in the Third Lebanon War and the children who will fight in the Fourth Lebanon War are being born now,” he said. “This war is creating the next war. The children that see their family die will not stop. I am pretty sure, based on the history, they will choose resistance and violence. It’s sad, but it’s the reality.” CNN’s Zeena Saifi contributed to this report."

Iran’s anxiety stems from uncertainty about whether the US can convince Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites and oil facilities, and the fact that its most important proxy militia in the region, Hezbollah, has been significantly weakened by Israeli military operations in recent weeks, the sources said. The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months , telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.” The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, have also expressed concern to the US about a potential attack on Iranian oil facilities, which could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN. The Biden administration is deeply worried that the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between Iran and Israel, which began earlier this year after Israel struck what Iran said was its consulate building in Damascus, could spiral into a major regional war that pulls the US in, too. A major part of the fears is that the US’ influence with Israel has appeared to be steadily waning over the last year. Similarly to its operations in Gaza, Israel has increasingly disregarded the US’ calls for more restraint in Lebanon, where Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground offensive has killed over 1,400 people since late last month. Israel also did not consult with the US before conducting a massive attack that exploded thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah operatives last month, or before assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and upending a delicate ceasefire proposal that had been put forward by the US and France less than 48 hours earlier. Israel’s security cabinet has not yet reached a decision on how to proceed, an Israeli official told CNN on Friday. And while the gap between the US and Israeli positions is narrowing, it may not remain that way, a US official said. “We can’t actually know whether they voted or not,” a senior administration official said of the Israeli cabinet’s discussions, expressing skepticism over the level of transparency about what Israel is sharing with the US. The official suggested they can’t “put too much stock in the machinations” of the Israeli government. As of last week, Israel had not given any assurances that it would not target Iran’s nuclear facilities, CNN reported. Israel has for decades been planning attacks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and just two years ago simulated striking them in a military exercise. Israel is also suspected of carrying out assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years, and Iran’s nuclear facilities have come under siege from cyberattacks, likely from Israel—the most famous being the Stuxnet virus, which was able to penetrate Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility. ‘Our strike will be powerful’ Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a strong warning to Iran about his country’s response on Wednesday. “Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,” Gallant said. The Gulf states, broadly, are eager to stay on the sidelines of the conflict, the Arab diplomat said. While Iran has publicly warned that any parties seen as aiding Israel will be treated as aggressors, it is also unlikely that Iran’s neighbors would explicitly come to Tehran’s defense in the event of an Israeli attack. But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have told both the US and Iran that they will not allow Israel to use their airspace to strike Iran, the Arab diplomat and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. Jordan also will protect its airspace from any unauthorized intrusion, regardless of the origin, a Jordanian official said. The US does not believe that Iran wants to become entangled in a full-scale war with Israel, and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera this week that Netanyahu “is the only one who wants a war and to set the region on fire to stay in power.” But the US has still urged Tehran, through backchannels, to calibrate its response if Israel attacks, an official said. While Qatar regularly speaks to the Iranians and relays back to the US what they say, the US official said that ultimately “we just do not know what [Iran] will do.” Key voices within Iran will have different ideas about if and how to respond to Israel, but that will depend on the scale and scope of the highly anticipated Israeli move, another US official said. This official said that messaging from Iran has been consistent both publicly and privately since Tehran launched its barrage of missiles at Israel earlier this month and there has not been a significant change in messaging. Iran has been particularly interested in getting help from Saudi Arabia in preventing an Israeli attack and using their influence with Washington to help find a solution to the crisis, the Arab diplomat told CNN. Officials from each country have met three times in less than a month, and Araghchi traveled to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to “consult on regional developments” and to “try to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon and Gaza,” he told local media. The world is watching Israel’s every move as it contemplates how to respond. But at least until Saturday at sundown, Israel will be at a standstill to mark Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and the holiest day of the year in Judaism. And though it’s not impossible Israel might launch action, shops, restaurants and other services will be closed, public transport will not be operating and even the country’s main airport — the Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv — will be shut down.

Israel’s actions in the besieged Palestinian enclave “constitute the war crimes of willful killing and mistreatment and the crime against humanity of extermination,” the commission said in a statement Thursday. “Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles” in Gaza, according to the report by the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. The Israeli attacks resulted in “fuel, food, water, medicines and medical supplies not reaching hospitals, while also drastically reducing permits for patients to leave the territory for medical treatment,” it said.

REUTERS/Ramadan Abed Ramadan Abed/Reuters Related article Israeli strike kills at least 28 Palestinians at school in central Gaza, Red Crescent says The Israeli foreign ministry called the accusations “outrageous” and said they were “another blatant attempt by the (commission) to delegitimize the very existence of the State of Israel and obstruct its right to protect its population while covering up the crimes of terrorist organizations.” “This report shamelessly portrays Israel’s operations in terror-infested health facilities in Gaza as a matter of policy against Gaza’s health system, while entirely dismissing overwhelming evidence that medical facilities in Gaza have been systematically used by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad for terrorist activities.” Hamas, it said, uses medical facilities to conceal operatives, store weapons, conduct attacks and hide hostages. Hamas has repeatedly denied that it uses hospitals for military activity. The UN report also accused Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups of committing war crimes of “torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, rape and sexual violence” for their treatment of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza. It also investigated “institutionalized mistreatment” of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. The Israeli foreign ministry rejected “accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees,” saying Israel is “fully committed to international legal standards” on treatment of detainees. In a statement accompanying the 24-page report, which does not have the force of law, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Israel “must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction” in Gaza. “Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,” she said. CNN Related card Flattened in a year: How Israeli bombardment reduced most of Gaza to rubble As part of the report, UN experts investigated the killing of 5-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab , who made headlines in late January after a recording emerged of her pleading to emergency workers to rescue her and her family after they became trapped in their car due to Israeli shelling. Despite an ambulance arriving at the scene while the girl was still alive, the presence of Israeli security forces effectively “prevented access,” meaning the bodies of Rajab’s relatives “could not be retrieved from their bullet-ridden car until 12 days after the incident,” the report said. The report “determined on reasonable grounds that the Israeli Army’s 162nd Division” which operated in the area at the time is “responsible for killing the family of seven, shelling the ambulance and killing the two paramedics inside.” The incident was just one of several alleged attacks on health care in Gaza, amid broader wartime conditions. The report will be presented to the UN General Assembly on October 30. The commission previously alleged that both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in the early stages of the Gaza war, and that Israel’s actions also amounted to crimes against humanity.

Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Lacroix described hostilities between Israeli forces and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon as “increasingly alarming,” and putting “peacekeepers at serious risk.” “The safety and security of peacekeepers is now increasingly in jeopardy,” Lacroix said. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reported early Thursday that the peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli tank fired toward an observation tower at its headquarters in the southern Lebanese city Naqoura. The Israeli tank fire directly hit the tower, causing the peacekeepers to fall, UNIFIL said, adding that other “nearby positions have been repeatedly hit.” UNFIL said that “any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have accused Hezbollah of operating in areas near UNIFIL posts, and said in a statement that it had asked UNIFIL forces to “remain in protected spaces” during the incident. Clipped From Video video Related video CNN reports from deserted Lebanese beach “The IDF is operating in southern Lebanon and maintains routine communication with UNIFIL,” the IDF said in a statement after Thursday’s incident. “This morning (Thursday), IDF troops operated in the area of Naqoura, next to a UNIFIL base. Accordingly, the IDF instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area,” the statement added. UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said the two peacekeepers – both Indonesian – were hospitalized. Their injuries are not serious, he said. UN peacekeepers have been stationed in southern Lebanon since 2006 , per a mandate by the United Nations Security Council. UN peacekeepers were drawn from armies of several nations to monitor the situation along the roughly 120-kilometer (74-mile) Blue Line which separates the two states. The incident came as Israel expands its strikes across Lebanon. On Thursday, Israeli strikes on a densely populated Beirut neighborhood killed at least 22 people and wounded 117, the Lebanese health ministry said. A senior Hezbollah official was the target of the attack, according to a source in the militant group and Israeli media reports. Wafiq Safa, leader of Hezbollah’s liaison unit, survived the assassination attempt, the Hezbollah source told CNN. Israel has not publicly claimed Thursday’s strikes or confirmed any targets. International outcry The injury of the UN peacekeepers drew condemnation from several countries including Italy, France, and Ireland, who all have contingents in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni summoned the Israeli ambassador in Rome on Thursday after what she described as “unacceptable” behavior by the Israeli forces. Meloni’s office said two Italian bases of UNIFIL were “hit by gunfire from the Israeli army” on Thursday and added that the prime minister spoke to the Commander of the Western Sector of the UNIFIL mission, Gen. Stefano Messina, for an update on the safety of the Italian troops. The Italian leader also contacted Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to “firmly remind” him that “what is happening near the Italian UNIFIL bases in southern Lebanon” is “unacceptable,” according to an Italian government statement. Indonesia’s mission to the UN blasted Israel over what it called “deliberate attacks,” saying Friday that Israel’s actions “represent a blatant attempt to spread terror on the ground to intimidate both the peacekeeping mission and international community.” France also expressed “deep concern” after the attack, saying it was “awaiting explanations from the Israeli authorities.” “The protection of peacekeepers is an obligation imposed on all parties to a conflict. France calls on the parties to respect this obligation, and to allow UNIFIL to continue to implement its mandate, including by respecting its freedom of movement,” a spokesperson for the French foreign ministry said. Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin described the IDF’s “targeting & firing on UNIFIL positions” as “reprehensible” and “unacceptable.” Earlier this week, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris also expressed concern after Israeli tanks were stationed close to an UN outpost manned by Irish peacekeepers. The European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell condemned what he called an “inadmissible act,” posting to X: “Another line has been dangerously crossed in Lebanon: IDF shelling of UN peacekeepers whose positions are known. We condemn this inadmissible act, for which there is no justification.” The EU foreign policy chief reiterated his support for UNIFIL and called for full accountability regarding the incident.

The attack on the Rafidah school injured at least 54 Palestinians, according to the Red Crescent. Hospital officials have confirmed the death toll. The Israeli military said it struck “terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center” at the school compound, saying “numerous steps” were taken to protect civilians. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. CNN footage showed children being carried into ambulances, their faces covered with blood, and many of them screaming and crying. One girl lay on the hospital floor, wearing only underpants, shaking and covered in blood, with severe burns on her body. “Am I going to die?” the girl asked medical workers at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. “What happened?” The strike tore down the walls of the school, covering its rooms with blackened debris. Responders and survivors dug through the wreckage trying to recover bodies. Ayman Abou Khousa, a displaced Palestinian who was sheltering at the school, said the attack came “by surprise,” and he is now still looking for his relatives under the rubble. CNN Related card Flattened in a year: How Israeli bombardment reduced most of Gaza to rubble “We are dying every day,” he told CNN. “The world has sold us out… every day you (journalists) come here and film us. You’ve been filming us for a year,” Khousa said, adding that Gazans are still forced to dig for their dead with their bare hands. Another man working to recover bodies said that survivors are looking for their relatives “in pieces,” as the attack scattered their remains. Footage from the site showed some of those killed being moved in pieces, with limbs gathered in bedsheets and blankets by survivors. “Why are they hitting the school? It is all displaced people, mostly women,” Iftekhar Hammouda, another woman who was sheltering at the school, said, adding that “there is no Hamas” there. “Where can people go? Where do they flee? They hit us at our homes, at our tents, on the streets and at the schools,” Hammouda added. Thursday’s strike is the latest to hit a school in Gaza. Last month, an Israeli strike on a school compound near Gaza city, killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials. Israel said it targeted Hamas fighters sheltering there. In August, local officials said that more than 90 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school and mosque in Al-Tabi’in compound in the Al-Daraj neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City, where displaced people were sheltering. Israel confirmed it carried out the strike, saying it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters. Israel has renewed its military operation in some parts of Gaza, saying it is targeting attempts by Hamas to regroup, and has ordered mass evacuations of multiple neighborhoods across the enclave. The latest strike comes as Gaza’s health ministry reported more than 42,000 people killed in the besieged territory since the war began a year ago following the Hamas attacks of October 7, and as Israel presses on with a ground incursion into Lebanon while weighing an attack on Iran.

Iran launched dozens of missiles towards Israel on October 1 in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others in Lebanon. The missiles had to pass through Iraq’s airspace to reach Israel. Air France Flight AF662 was flying over Iraq when the Iranian attack began at around 4:45 p.m. UTC (11.45 a.m. ET) and left Iraqi airspace “shortly before” 5 p.m. UTC (12 p.m. ET), the airline told CNN in a statement. Iraqi airspace was not officially closed by local authorities until 5:56 p.m. UTC (12:56 p.m. ET), it added. “Thanks to the information we gathered we were able to identify a forthcoming attack on Israel by Iran, involving the launch of ballistic missiles,” Air France said. “As a result, and without waiting for instructions from the Iraqi authorities, Air France decided to suspend the overflight of the country’s airspace by its aircraft from 5 p.m. UTC [12 p.m. ET],” it added.

He certainly didn’t go to Gaza as president , and CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post have all found no proof he made a prior visit. Perhaps he merely meant he has been to Palestinian territory, since he did visit the West Bank in 2017 ? Or maybe he was just talking about having been to the broader region? Nope. Trump’s campaign said Monday night that he meant what he said about having been to Gaza in particular – and the campaign insisted the claim is true. “President Trump has been to Gaza previously and has always worked to ensure peace in the Middle East,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN. Leavitt, though, did not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed trip to Gaza. And she did not respond when we repeatedly asked for even the most basic information, like the year of the supposed visit. So we were highly skeptical – because Trump has a long history of making things up , because of the lack of public evidence, because the Times of Israel has reported that Trump had never even visited Israel before his presidency, and because the Trump campaign had offered a substantively different comment to The New York Times earlier Monday. That earlier comment , which a campaign official provided only on condition of anonymity, did not say Trump had actually been to Gaza. Instead, the anonymous campaign official tried some spin, correctly saying that Trump has been to Israel but wrongly saying, “Gaza is in Israel.” We asked three former Trump officials who worked on Middle East policy whether they know of any proof for the former president’s claim, and the campaign’s claim to CNN, that Trump has been to Gaza itself. The only one who has responded, Trump-appointed former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker , said in an email: “As far as I know, he’s never traveled there. He did not go in 2017 when he visited Israel. I think this story is probably already over.” Another wild goose chase For years, Trump’s uncorroborated stories have sent us on fact-check wild goose chases – seeking everything from proof that he was years ago named “Man of the Year” in Michigan ( he wasn’t ) to proof that something terrible related to immigration had happened “last night in Sweden” in 2017 ( nothing had happened ). This new hunt was equally fruitless. Trump aides told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that the former president privately said he did indeed to go to Gaza and that his comment in the Monday interview was not a mistake. But those aides were unable to provide any details about his alleged trip, including when he traveled, why he went or who he was with. David Friedman, who served as Trump’s ambassador to Israel, and Jason Greenblatt, a former Trump Organization executive who became Trump’s special representative for international negotiations, did not immediately respond Tuesday to our requests for comment. And since we were determined to give Trump associates and supporters every possible opportunity to substantiate the claim, we also took the rare step late Monday night of putting out a public request on X for any corroborating information. As of noon on Tuesday, nobody had replied with any. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Alayna Treene contributed to this report ."

Mohammad Sultan, 28, said he and his family fled their house in Jabalya in northern Gaza “due to the intense and continuous bombardments in the area.” When he went back to retrieve food, water and blankets, he and other civilians were fired at, he said. “Drones were firing at everyone passing by on the road,” Sultan told CNN. “Three people were shot right in front of me. My brother and I tried to help the injured get to the hospitals, but a little girl was shot in the neck, and her father was also injured.” The shooting took place at Abu Sharkh roundabout in Jabalya, according to Sultan. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. Footage taken by Sultan during his journey shows residents walking along a sandy road, surrounded by rubble and half-destroyed buildings. Some, including children, are on foot, struggling to walk with heavy bags. Others are on bicycles or tuk-tuks.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters Related article A year into the war, Israeli military operations in Gaza continue to ramp up and Hamas is yet to be defeated The Israeli military on Monday issued fresh evacuation orders in both northern and southern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering. In northern Gaza, the military said it is “currently operating with great force in the area” and told residents to move to Al Mawasi, a southern region designated as a so-called humanitarian zone that is already crammed with refugees. A day earlier, Israel’s military said it had encircled Jabalya as it launched a new ground operation there amid efforts by Hamas to “rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.” Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said on Monday it was engaged in “fierce fights” with Israeli forces in northern Gaza. Flyers were dropped by the Israeli military over Jabalya Tuesday morning, “urgently” warning residents to “evacuate immediately,” residents told CNN. The renewed fighting comes on the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Gunfire at ‘anything that moves’ Hassan Hamad, a resident of Jabalya, was killed this week in his home in Jabalya, his aunt Itaf told CNN. She decided to stay in the city to collect his remains and give him a dignified burial. After months of documenting Israel’s offensive in Jabalya,18-year-old Hamad was killed when his family’s apartment was hit in an Israeli missile attack in the city’s refugee camp on Sunday, according to witness testimony and footage shared with CNN. Gunfire and shelling have stopped his aunt from leaving the house in search of her nephew’s remains, which were scattered around the area after the assault, she told CNN. “We stayed in the house to search for the remaining body parts of Hassan, but now we cannot go out due to the intensity of the shelling and gunfire,” the 58-year-old said, adding the gunfire targets “anything that moves.” The Jabalya refugee camp has been left in ruins by repeated Israeli attacks. Mahmoud ssa/Anadolu/Getty Images Itaf spoke to CNN on the phone from her home in Jabalya, where shelling could be heard in the background. “We try to stay away from the windows, so they won’t shoot at us,” she said. Residents say the fighting in Jabalya has been some of the most intense in recent days. Mohammad Ibrahim, a resident of the city who decided to stay in his home with his two sons, said the explosions outside his house were so intense they “shook” his body. “I felt as though my body was tearing apart,” Ibrahim told CNN, adding that the firing is more intense than it was at the outset of the war. From his window, Ibrahim said he could see smoke billowing between abandoned apartment buildings. “Anyone who wants to leave the north to Gaza wants death,” he said. Jabalya has been targeted several times during the war, and like many other parts of Gaza, its residents say they don’t know where to go for shelter. “We are living in the Stone Age,” Ibrahim said. “There is no conscience, no humanity, no human rights.”"

Once the ceasefire is firmly established and diplomacy can reach it, all other details will be discussed and decisions will be made collaboratively,” Deputy Secretery General Naim Qassem said. AFP video Related video Massive Israeli airstrikes hit 120 targets in Lebanon. See video of explosion in Beirut Lebanon’s Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8 last year to show solidarity with Hamas, which had launched an attack on Israel from Gaza a day earlier. Hezbollah had previously stated that it would only cease its attacks on Israel once a ceasefire was reached with Hamas in Gaza. Israel, however, insisted that Hezbollah separate its conflict with Israel from the ongoing war with Hamas. In his speech marking the first anniversary of Hezbollah’s involvement in the war, Qassem did not mention a Gaza ceasefire as a condition for achieving one in Lebanon. It was Qassem’s second speech since Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah late last month. Israel has since been conducting limited ground incursions into southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, which has continued to fire rockets into northern Israel. Nabih Berri, the leader of the Shiite Amal party that is allied with Hezbollah, has been a key figure in negotiations for a ceasefire mediated by Western nations. Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN last week that Nasrallah had agreed to a temporary ceasefire that was called for by US President Joe Biden, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and other allies during last month’s UN General Assembly. Soon after, Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel. US officials have told CNN that the Biden administration isn’t actively trying to revive the deal and has resigned itself to trying to shape and limit Israeli operations in Lebanon and against Iran rather than halting hostilities. Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, said in an interview with Sky News on Sunday that Nasrallah hadn’t agreed to a ceasefire and called Bou Habib’s claim “ridiculous.” Smoke rises in Beirut's southern suburbs after a strike, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, as seen from Hadath, Lebanon on Tuesday. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters ‘Abyss of a long war’ In a video message on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has “eliminated” Hashem Safieddine , the successor to Nasrallah. However, the Israeli military said it is still checking whether a strike on Hezbollah intelligence headquarters in Beirut killed him. Netanyahu addressed the people of Lebanon directly in the message, urging them to stand up to Hezbollah and “take back your country,” and threatening them with a Gaza style war if they do not. “Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites alike – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war in Israel,” Netanyahu said. “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will bring destruction and suffering similar to what we see in Gaza,” he continued. Israel’s war on Hezbollah has killed more than 1,400 people in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced since fighting escalated last month, Lebanese authorities have said. Despite the nod to ceasefire talks, much of Qassem’s speech on Tuesday carried a defiant tone, emphasizing Hezbollah’s readiness and capability to continue its fight against Israel. “If the enemy continues its war, then the battlefield will be decisive, and the battlefield belongs to us” he said. Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched a large barrage of rockets toward the Israeli cities of Haifa and Kiryat, one of the largest on the city since the start of the war. The rockets were fired from Lebanon in two separate barrages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. While numerous rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military, at least two buildings in Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin were directly hit, it said.

On Monday, as Israel marked a year since Hamas’ October 7 attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “continue to fight” and achieve the country’s war goals, including toppling Hamas and “eliminating any future threat from Gaza to Israel.” The same day, the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders in both northern and southern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering. In northern Gaza, the military said it is “currently operating with great force in the area” and told residents to move to Al Mawasi, a southern region designated as a so-called humanitarian zone that is already crammed with refugees. A new military ground operation was launched on Sunday in Jabalya, northern Gaza, where the military said it is encircling the area after it saw signs of Hamas rebuilding. Earlier this year, Israel’s military said it had defeated Hamas in northern Gaza, only to announce new operations there in May. Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters are engaged “in fierce clashes at zero distance with the enemy forces” in Jabalya, an indication the group has maintained a presence there to keep fighting. Casualties in the north have also mounted in recent days. Ahead of the Israeli military announcements Monday, hospitals said they had received five bodies and several injured people following Israeli “artillery fire” in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.

Footage from the scene showed multiple bodies lying in the street covered in blood. The strike happened about three hours after the Israeli military issued the evacuation order. About an hour after the first evacuation order, the military issued another directive to leave parts of southern Gaza near Khan Younis. The military said it was responding with “extreme force” to Hamas actions in the area and also called on Palestinians to evacuate to Al Mawasi. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are already sheltering in Al Mawasi after fleeing Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza. The new evacuation orders mean more people will be displaced yet again, and crammed into a very small area — worsening an already critical humanitarian situation. Lena, a worker for non-profit organization Mercy Corps, told CNN she had been displaced more than a dozen times since last year. CNN is not using her real name due to concerns for her safety. “We haven’t put our clothes in wardrobes, bathed comfortably, had a meal with any sense of peace, slept on a proper bed, or had clean drinking water in over a year,” said Lena, who now lives in a shelter in central Gaza. The Israel military said it intercepted five projectiles launched from northern Gaza on Monday. Earlier in the day, nine projectiles were launched from southern Gaza, injuring two people, the military said.

The woman and hundreds of others were reliving in real time the moment terrorists stormed the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel, marking the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks in which Hamas and other militant groups killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, taking them back into Gaza. The brutality of the attack on the festival shocked the world. As revelers danced and partied in the desert, scores of Hamas terrorists stormed the site, blocked off escape routes, and embarked on a killing spree. They ambushed groups trying to hide and murdered people as they tried to escape. They shot victims at point blank range in their cars and fired machine guns and anti-tank weapons indiscriminately at those who tried to flee on foot. Over the past year, the site of the massacre – a remote location just a few miles from the Gaza perimeter – has been turned into a memorial. Instead of the vast open space, there are now hundreds of near identical cenotaphs, each featuring the name and a picture of a victim. The family of Amit Itzhak David gathers at his memorial at the site of the attack on the Nova Music Festival.

To mark the anniversary of his death, his family huddled around the memorial on Monday, hugging each other and David’s picture. The 23-year-old was killed here last year, shortly after returning from a trip to South America, where he had been celebrating the end of his compulsory military service. David’s cousin Inbar Parnassa told CNN the family doesn’t come to the site often. “It’s too difficult to be here and see all of this,” she said. Parnassa and other members of the family were all wearing matching T-shirts embroidered with David’s name and the sign of the horns – his favorite gesture.

A music lover and a former junior wrestler, Amit too was murdered at the site. The Nova Music Festival massacre was by far the deadliest of the October 7 attacks, accounting for nearly a third of the victims. There were so many dead and kidnapped that it took Israeli authorities months to determine how many people had been killed there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday that 347 people, most of them young, died at the site and some 40 others were kidnapped. Gabriel Barel’s mother, three brothers, and a best friend from the army all turned up in matching tops featuring his photograph. Barel’s brother Yeoda said the family initially believed he might have survived the attack and been taken to Gaza. People pray for the victims of the October 7 terror attack at the site of the Nova Music Festival. Ivana Kottasova/CNN But a few weeks later their hopes were crushed when Barel’s body was found. After shooting Barel dead, his attackers had set his car on fire. His remains were so badly burnt it took many weeks for him to be identified. Witnesses to the massacre say other victims were raped and subjected to sexual violence by Hamas. Hamas has denied the accusations, but the evidence of sexual violence comes from different sources — survivors who witnessed the events, first responders, medical and forensic experts. The United Nations and the International Criminal Court have offered evidence that Hamas attackers committed sexual crimes. War rages on Monday marked the first anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks, and a year since Israel began its war against the militant group in Gaza. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then. The war has sparked a major humanitarian disaster, displacing nearly all of the strip’s 2.2 million residents. As people gathered across Israel, the reminders that the war in Gaza is still raging kept coming. Throughout the morning, loud booms of outgoing fire reverberated throughout southern Israel as the IDF hit targets in the Gaza strip.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN Israel has said its goal in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas and bring back the remaining hostages, but neither has been achieved. Indeed, as the anniversary events got under way, several rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel, injuring two people. While increasingly rare, rocket launches such as these show that even after a year of intense war, militants in Gaza are still able to strike Israel. During a memorial service in kibbutz Nir Oz , the smoke trail of the rockets fired from Gaza was clearly visible in the sky.

Yehud was a volunteer medic at Nir Oz and when he realized the kibbutz was under attack and there were wounded, he rushed out to provide help. He was killed, but his remains were not found and identified until June. Yehud’s pregnant wife Sigal and three children survived the massacre. His fourth child was born just nine days later. Yehud’s sister Arbel was kidnapped and taken to Gaza with her boyfriend Ariel Cunio, alongside Cunio’s brother David, David’s wife Sharon Alony Cunio, and their three-year-old twin daughters. Alony Cunio and the two girls were released during a ceasefire deal agreed in November, but the rest of the group remains in captivity. “Dolev’s sister is still in Gaza. She’s one of the four or five civilian women still there alive. The most important thing now is to bring her and the rest of them back,” he said. Lifshitz grew up in the kibbutz and while he left at 16, he still has deep links there. His grandparents Oded and Yocheved were kidnapped from their homes in the kibbutz during the attack. Yocheved Lifshitz, who was 85 when kidnapped, spent more than two weeks in captivity. She was released alongside her neighbor and friend Nurit Cooper, 79, but both her and Cooper’s husbands were kept in Gaza. Nurit Cooper and her family were told in June that Amiram Cooper, her 84-year-old husband and one of the founders of the kibbutz, was no longer alive. His body is still in Gaza. “We cannot move on when people from the kibbutz are still there. Time stopped here,” Amat Moshe, whose grandparents were residents of the kibbutz, told CNN at the Nir Oz cemetery. Adina Moshe and her daughter Maya Shoshani Moshe mourn at the grave of Adina’s husband David. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Last October, Moshe’s grandmother Adina Moshe watched Hamas fighters storm her home and murder her husband David before kidnapping her and taking her to Gaza. She was released as part of a ceasefire deal in November last year. Sitting by David’s grave during the memorial ceremony on Monday, Adina was sobbing, her body slumped as if crushed by the horrors of the past year. Her daughter Maya Shoshani Moshe hurried to her side, trying to comfort her before bursting into tears herself. Moshe has previously spoken publicly about her ordeal in Gaza and has in the past made an emotional plea directly to Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the remaining hostages back. Gershon Baskin says he is in touch with Hamas officials about a deal and all that the Israeli Prime Minister needs to do is “sign it.” Clipped From Video video Related video Former Israeli hostage negotiator pushes for Netanyahu to sign a ceasefire deal “Again, I am asking you, Mr. Netanyahu, everything is in your hands, you’re the one who can do it, and I’m extremely scared, that if you continue along this path…there won’t be any more hostages to release,” she said in February after Netanyahu rejected the terms of a ceasefire and hostage deal put forward by Hamas. She expressed the views of many Israelis who are furious with Netanyahu. Mass protests against the prime minister and his government have once again become a common occurrence across the country and the anger burst into the public view on several occasions during the memorial events on Monday. Early in the day, family members of the hostages marched to Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, blasting a siren for two minutes outside his front door. Netanyahu did not make an appearance at the event, or any other gatherings aside from a small ceremony in Jerusalem. When hundreds of people gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday evening to commemorate the victims of the attacks, politics was meant to be off limits. But it soon became clear that for many of the family members who were speaking at the event, politics is too intertwined with the fate of their loved ones. Jonathan Shimriz, the brother of Alon Shimriz who was taken hostage and later killed in Gaza during a failed rescue operation, called for a state inquiry into the handling of the hostage crisis. “There is no personal example, no vision, no leadership, no accountability,” he told the crowd."

The US’ inability to halt Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground invasion of Lebanon, which has killed over 1,400 people in less than three weeks and displaced over 1 million more, has raised questions about whether Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is disregarding the Biden administration’s calls for more restraint like it did in Gaza, leaving the White House again looking feckless. Concerns within the Biden administration are running high, officials say, that what Israel has promised would be a limited operation will soon grow into a larger-scale and prolonged conflict. US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have also floundered . As with Gaza, US officials say Israel was initially planning for a much larger ground incursion into Lebanon before the US convinced it to scale back. But they also acknowledge what they have learned over the last year, which is that the US’ influence is limited when it comes to Israel’s military operations. “We couldn’t stop them from taking action, but we can at least try to shape what it looks like,” one senior US official told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations. The ceasefire proposal , which the US put forward with France, had called for a 21-day pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah to give the sides space to work on a larger deal to return Israeli and Lebanese civilians to their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. “We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah’s infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah’s capability, but we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday. “And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.” Senior US officials have also acknowledged that the US has limited leverage over what Israel decides to do against Iran following Tehran’s missile attack last week. The US has been urging Israel not to be overly escalatory with a retaliatory strike, the official said. But they cautioned that what Israel sees as a proportional attack may not be in line with what the rest of the world — including the US — would consider to be a measured response. President Joe Biden said last week that he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities, but it is not clear whether the US has successfully persuaded Israel to take that option off the table. “The only leverage that the Americans have right now is summoning the defense minister to Washington and buying time,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is scheduled to meet with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Wednesday, a visit the Biden administration may hope buys time for consultations and planning before Israel carries out its promised retaliation against Iran. With Gallant in Washington, Pinkas says the US likely believes Israel will wait to attack. “This would make sense in a political science simulation game, not in Israeli politics,” Pinkas said. Netanyahu was in New York when Israel carried out the massive strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. An attack against Iran, though far more complicated than striking a neighboring country, could still be carried out with the defense minister abroad, Pinkas said, especially given the acrimonious relationship between Netanyahu and Gallant. Gallant said Israel is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but Israel will ultimately make its own decision about how it retaliates. “Everything is on the table,” Gallant told CNN on Sunday. ‘The right moment’ for diplomacy The US still wants to see Lebanon ceasefire talks resume, officials said, and US officials continue to believe that the conflict can only be resolved diplomatically. “We’re going to be having regular consultations with the Israelis, with the Lebanese and others, regarding the right moment to press for such an agreement,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday. But “the Israelis have to get beyond some things before we can revisit those conversations,” said one senior administration official. That official and another source said it is not even clear at this point who the US would be dealing with on any ceasefire talks. Nasrallah and other members of Hezbollah’s senior leadership are now dead as a result of Israel’s operations in Lebanon. And while one US official expressed hope that the Lebanese government could now exert more control over the militant group, the Lebanese state is experiencing a similar power vacuum, having been without a president or fully empowered Cabinet since October 2022. Austin said Friday that he believes the Lebanese government has an important opportunity  to demonstrate “that it wants to care for its people” and siphon support away from Hezbollah, particularly now that the group’s chain of command “has really been stripped away at the strategic and operational level.” But Israel’s punishing air campaign in Beirut could make it harder for a functioning Lebanese government to emerge from the rubble, one of the officials noted. “What’s going on in Beirut is not what we had wanted,” he said. Austin and other senior members of Biden’s national security team – including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines – convened in the Oval Office on September 30 for several hours, discussing Israel’s intensifying operations in Lebanon. Earlier in the day, a reluctant Biden told reporters he’d be “comfortable with [Israel] stopping” the campaign in Lebanon that risked further inflaming the region. Behind closed doors, sources say, Biden offered reluctant support for eliminating Hezbollah infrastructure along Israel’s border and in southern Lebanon, as long as Israel’s operations remained limited in nature. While the US has been generally supportive of that strategy, several officials including Austin have voiced concerns to Israel about mitigating civilian harm in its airstrikes —particularly in southern Beirut, a densely populated area where several residential buildings have been flattened in recent weeks. “The secretary has been very clear about the importance of taking civilian safety into account when planning and conducting operations, and that hasn’t changed,” Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Monday when asked whether he supports Israel’s operations in Beirut. “That continues to be a topic of discussion between [Austin] and Minister Gallant.” Israel says it is working to mitigate civilian casualties, noting that it has issued evacuation notices to Lebanese residents in recent days before conducting operations. But CNN teams in Beirut last week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. US officials are also concerned about the operations Israel is conducting so close to Beirut’s main airport, which could threaten the ability of American citizens to leave the country via the limited commercial options that remain. Ryder said the US is in discussions with Israel about the airport as it relates to the safety of Americans living in the country, and State Department spokesperson Miller said the US “has made clear” to Israel that it wants the roads to the airport in Beirut to “continue to be operational.” CNN’s MJ Lee and Alex Marquardt contributed reporting."

But the shocking terror attacks from Hamas — the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust — brought with it a flood of outside reporters and focus of the world as the ensuing war rages on and seemingly expands. In the year since the devastating war began, a record number of media workers have lost their lives, the vast majority as the result of the Israeli military’s bombardment of Gaza. Reporters have faced physical threats for their coverage and major obstacles in getting information out of the warzone - especially from Gaza. Journalists have also endured internal newsroom pressure and vitriolic attacks from readers and viewers over any perceived bias or error. The October 7 attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza has roiled the region like never before, challenging the news media’s coverage and upending the region’s politics and policy for generations to come. An ‘unprecedented’ toll The year since the war began has been the deadliest for media workers since most journalism and press freedom organizations have started tracking journalist deaths in conflict. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders , at least 128 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war, nearly all of them Palestinian media workers in Gaza killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes. Some of the journalists died while wearing protective gear identifying them as members of the press. Multiple news organizations and free press groups have accused the Israeli military of deliberately targeting journalists. RE'IM, ISRAEL - OCTOBER 07: Family and friends gather at the Nova festival memorial to mark the first anniversary since Hamas attacked one year ago on October 07, 2024 in Re'im, Israel. Various commemorations are taking place around Israel to mark the  anniversary of the Hamas attacks in Israel. On October 7, 2023, members of Hamas mounted a series of attacks and raids on Israeli citizens in the Gaza Envelope border area of Israel. 251 Israelis and foreigners were kidnapped with nearly 100 still unaccounted for and 1139 people were killed. (Photo by Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images) Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images Related live-story Israel marks anniversary of Hamas attacks as Middle East war rages “One year in, Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza has exacted an unprecedented and horrific toll on Palestinian journalists and the region’s media landscape,” CPJ said . The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not intentionally target journalists, but that it cannot guarantee the safety of reporters in an “active military zone” and has accused Hamas of deliberately placing military operations “in the vicinity of journalists and civilians.” It has also accused a handful of Palestinian journalists as having participated in the Oct. 7 attack or being members of Hamas, something the media organizations have largely and vehemently denied . But even excluding these accusations, the toll on media workers is astronomical. Many media organizations, including CNN, evacuated their full-time staff in the enclave with their families as soon as possible. Gaza was never an easy place to report from, between restrictions on entry and exit and pressure from Hamas against any inkling of dissent. But now, seemingly nowhere is safe, and the journalists who are left are operating in harsh conditions and having to contend with just surviving in an active war zone. “A few brave Palestinian journalists in Gaza have continued to work for international media, braving extremely difficult conditions to continue reporting, the likes of which few veteran war reporters have experienced,” said Tania Kraemer, chair of the Foreign Press Association based in Jerusalem and a correspondent for German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle. “They face the constant threat of Israeli bombardment and have a hard time moving around. They also face the challenges faced by other Palestinians in Gaza: They are displaced, often living in tents without sufficient basic supplies in a situation of widespread chaos and lawlessness and are responsible for their families.” Reporters in Israel have also noted a marked increase in physical attacks, with the Union of Journalists in Israel noting at least 40 such attacks since October 7, from security forces as well as civilians. Four Israeli journalists were killed in the October 7 attacks, and others barely survived . Access and pressure One of the biggest challenges for international news organizations has been the complete blockade of the Gaza strip by Israel (and supported by Egypt) of foreign reporters entering the enclave. Although the Israeli military has taken international reporters on dozens of “embeds” with their troops, the reporters on these trips have no freedom of movement and are not allowed to speak to Palestinians. The raw footage is also subject to Israeli military censorship. CNN’s Clarissa Ward is one of the only foreign journalists to have entered the strip without the Israeli military, when she embedded with a United Arab Emirates field hospital crew . The FPA has petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to force the military to allow journalists to enter Gaza independently. So far, they’ve been unsuccessful. The Israeli government has also taken unprecedented steps that have pressured international press in Israel - most notably by shutting down Al Jazeera’s operations in Israel and the West Bank, alleging the network is “being used to incite terror, to support terrorist activities and that the channel’s broadcasts endanger … security and public order.” Al Jazeera, the Israeli Journalists Union, the FPA and many international organizations have slammed the move. CNN video Related video ‘I want her back alive, not in a bag’: A year of anguish for mothers in Israel and Gaza Israeli authorities have also become far more aggressive with the foreign press - at one point earlier this year Israeli authorities seized the video equipment of an Associated Press team that was airing live footage of the Gaza skyline as seen from southern Israel. Within a day, the equipment was hastily returned after swift backlash from the US and free press groups. Constant vitriol For the foreign journalists covering the conflict, the internal and external pressures over their reporting have been unlike anything they’ve ever experienced, several reporters who spoke with CNN said. All spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about sensitive subjects. An American journalist covering the conflict told CNN he’s taken on criticism, including from within his own newsroom, for interviewing figures that others found abhorrent whether they be an Israeli soldier, a Palestinian civilian, a rescued Israeli hostage or a member of Hamas. “Old school journalism is that you are curious about every player, and you want to understand what motivates them, and you want to understand their story, and you want to see things through their eyes, but I’ve experienced just really shocking pushback,” he said. On social media, the criticism has been more intense. “American journalists are talking to all the sides. That’s what we do. It’s the audiences that reject that very principle,” the reporter said. The reporter has come to see that Palestinians and Israelis, and those that support them, are experiencing the war with each other from “irreconcilable worlds” that are not able to understand “how their pain is wrapped up in the other people’s pain.” Nic Robertson reports from the site of the Nova Festival massacre in Israel, where pain and sorrow run deep in the families of those killed by Hamas last October 7. Clipped From Video video Related video Revisiting the site of the of Nova Music Festival massacre, one year on “You’re trying to do this superhuman task, which is be in everybody’s shoes and and try to convey and be true to the fullness of this war,” he said. But “this story really fundamentally makes you kind of question all the journalistic tenants that you were taught.” BBC News CEO Deborah Turness wrote in a memo ahead of the October 7 anniversary that “this is the most polarizing conflict that any of us have experienced in our careers as journalists.” “[I]f there is one thing we have learned more than any other in the past year, it’s that such is the depth of the polarization in this war, so many have come to see impartial reporting as being somehow against them, because it does not solely reflect their view of the conflict,” she wrote. A choice of words In the Middle East, a single word, or even the order in which certain phrases are uttered, can convey some sort of perceived bias. When should a person or a group be labeled a terrorist? What about a war crime? When should a military operation be called an invasion? Even laying out a timeline of when this latest conflict began is loaded with meaning. Some reporters noted that in recent years American and other foreign media have started shifting how they describe aspects of the conflict, such as calling the West Bank “occupied,” and noting Israeli villages in the West Bank as “illegal settlements under international law.” “People have woken up to things that maybe we didn’t pay attention to before,” a foreign reporter based in the region said. The war has made reporters and their audiences “a lot more vigilant and cynical,” with credibility issues from both Palestinian and Israeli sides. Janine Zacharia, a lecturer at Stanford University’s Department of Communications and former Jerusalem Bureau Chief for The Washington Post, said the news media can often get mired in a word choice debate when they shouldn’t. “People say, ‘You shouldn’t say militants. You should say terrorists on one side,’ and then the other side says, ‘You’ve got to call this a genocide. How can you not call this a genocide?’ So, I go back to what I learned at Reuters in the ‘90s, which is to say what it is, say what happened,” Zacharia said. “It’s better to say what’s happening more specifically on the ground and resist, when you can, labels that are disputed.” Professor William Lafi Youmans of George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs said he has found that there “has been an intensification of sedimented, institutionalized bias” toward Israeli framing over the past year, especially in television news. CNN video Related video IDF soldiers warned about attack before Oct. 7 Youmans said his research has shown “Palestinian frames” of the conflict using words like “occupation” and “apartheid,” are “rarely voiced on broadcast television” by reporters or anchors themselves, compared to “Israeli frames,”  such as describing Hamas members as “terrorists.” Youmans also noted that Israeli officials “are far more present” than Palestinian or Hamas officials. (The United States and European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Hamas is also the governing body of Gaza and administers all aspects of life there.) Others of course, argue the opposite. A former BBC governor, along with a former BBC director of television published a report claiming the broadcaster has routinely parroted anti-Israel views. The personal toll The pressures on the press in the region — Palestinian, Israeli and foreign — are of course, astronomical after a year of nonstop, difficult work. Beyond the physical threats, many have also faced mental health challenges from witnessing horrific violence both in person and from the vast documentation streaming into their newsrooms every hour. Then there’s relentless criticism of their work. One reporter told CNN he has had “physical reactions” to footage of the October 7 attacks, as well as the images and videos of victims in Gaza. Another said they can no longer eat red meat because of the images they’ve seen. Others have faced health problems from stress and have had personal relationships suffer due to their coverage. “Maybe I’m just numb,” one of the foreign reporters said with a cynical chuckle as he described what has become routine coverage of relentless airstrikes in Gaza. “You don’t want to be numb, but when you’ve done it 100 times already, that’s not a good thing.”"

Israel, its enemies and allies are all harbingers and painful witnesses to a remaking of the region’s diplomatic and political architecture on a scale that could rival the upheavals of the Arab-Israeli conflict a half-century ago. The post-October 7 changes are both inevitable and, in their current chaotic form at least, preventable. The civilian cost is mounting when diplomacy might have saved lives. A year ago it seemed the political architecture of the region was on the cusp of significant change. Propelled by US incentives, Saudi Arabia and Israel seemed closer than ever to a historic normalization of relations. Diplomacy and the deft skills needed to stitch such a complex deal together were in the ascendency. But the prospect of approaching peace and prosperity evaporated as Hamas surged through the Gaza border fences at sunrise that Saturday morning. Butchery was afoot.

Some survivors are determined to return Irrespective of whether Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was calculating he could torpedo normalization and push the Palestinian cause ahead of regional priorities for peace and economic integration, in the short term he succeeded. I can remember, with gut-churning clarity, the smell of rotting human flesh as we entered Kfar Aza, about 800 yards from the Gaza Strip. It was October 10, and Major General Itai Veruv of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was leading the first international press access to see the devastation of Hamas’ attacks. He stood at the gates, quoting General Eisenhower when he reached the Nazi death camps in World War Two: “The first thing he said was bring the press here to see.” Over the past year Israel has struggled to keep the world focused on those nation-changing events of that bloody weekend. For the first time, many Israelis realized their state was no longer the safe haven for Jews they had always believed it to be. The idea that whatever prejudice and persecution they may face around the world, in Israel they had sanctuary, was destroyed. What emerged that first week as a scramble to seal the Gaza border and chase down remaining Hamas cells inside Israel soon manifested as a red mist of revenge and retribution against the attackers, and anyone near them. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is unwilling to be a partner in a deal that would resow Middle East relations.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Israelis’ feelings of vulnerability haven’t gone, while national rage has been refined into a steely logic of regional deterrence, manifested by Israel’s right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He has interwoven his own political survival, in part to escape accusations he failed to stop Hamas’ attacks, with bombastic new tactics shredding the old rule book and its red lines that previously prevented regional escalation. It is being called “escalation for de-escalation,” but as October 7, 2024, arrives, de-escalation, and any form of day after plan from Netanyahu, are absent. The Jewish state’s relations with US President Joe Biden’s White House, its most important ally, are at their lowest ebb in a generation. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, many by US bombs and bullets in Israel’s hands, authorities in Gaza say. IDF killings and arrests of Palestinians, some of them US citizens, in the occupied West Bank are unsustainable for many of Israel’s European allies whom after a year of waiting are beginning to curb arms supplies. But the pressures on Israel to rein in its survival instincts at a time when it is riven with deep political, religious, and maybe existential divisions are having little obvious traction. CNN One Thing How October 7th Paved the Way for a Widening War In recent weeks, fears of a wider war between Israel and Iran have grown after Israel launched a series of attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran fired a barrage of missiles into Israel. The tense moment comes nearly one year after the brutal Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th and the devastation of Gaza that followed. In this episode, we examine how the last year has fundamentally reshaped the Middle East and whether any kind of peace is possible going forward.

Apple Podcasts Spotify TuneIn iHeart Radio Pandora Amazon RSS Israel’s wiliest nearby adversary and Iranian mega-proxy Hezbollah – a blight on Lebanese post-civil war democracy – which began escalating cross-border rocket attacks the day after October 7, has undergone a lightening defenestration over the past few weeks. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah and many of his top commanders have been assassinated in Israeli air strikes, its forces partially crippled, ahead of Israel’s launch of its third ground war in Lebanon in the past half-century. Hamas’ October 7 attacks, if not coordinated in detail with Iran , certainly had its blessing. The theocracy has been the Palestinian terror group’s biggest backer for decades, funneling money, military material and know-how. Iran vows to destroy Israel and chase its biggest ally the United States out of the region. It uses pro-Palestinian messaging to enflame passions on the ‘Arab street’ in the region, most of whom are Sunni like the Palestinians, and most of whose leaders consider Iran, a Shia theocracy, at best untrustworthy, at worst an adversary. In this way Iran holds off regional rivals. Children look up to the sky at the sound of airstrikes in Gaza City on Monday, Oct. 7, 2023.

(Samar Abu Elouf/The New York Times) Samar Abu Elouf/The New York Times/Redux gallery Related gallery The defining images of the Israel-Hamas war The past year has revealed the extent of its plans and co-opting of Shia communities to build up pro-Iranian militias. Yemen’s minority Houthis are no longer only anti-Saudi stooges for the Shia clerics in Tehran, but have turned their Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles and drones on Tel Aviv. Iran has also, aided and fronted by the Houthis, begun blocking Red Sea commercial shipping – more than a thousand miles from Israel – on the pretext of supporting the Gazans. Tehran’s Shia proxies in Iraq have also answered its calls and begun escalating drone attacks on Israel. It is a multi-fronted war, escalating faster than would have ever seemed possible a year ago. Back then rocket sirens in central Israel were not part of daily life. Today parents inside their home shelters in Tel Aviv scan cell phones for messages from their children, serving on the front lines as they too once did. Each generation here is trained to fight in the defense of the nation; where the country divide is over how long to keep that fight going before switching to diplomacy. The reality is, the longer the escalation goes on, the less control the country and its prime minister will have over the outcome. Potential regional partners like Saudi Arabia are now demanding a steeper and steeper diplomatic off-ramp for Netanyahu. The normalization between Israel and the most powerful Gulf state that seemed so close before October 7, is for now out of reach, Netanyahu unwilling and too toxic to be a partner in the deal. It was a deal that would have given Biden a legacy to be proud of; for Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, MBS, the legitimacy and security he craves; and Netanyahu, an inoculation against a millennia of animus. Saudi Arabia’s price now is an “irreversible path” to a Palestinian state, which is anathema to Netanyahu, his extreme nationalist right-wing cabinet, and in the wake of October 7, even further beyond the pale for much of the rest of the country too. Days before the anniversary, a veteran sage of UAE diplomacy, Anwar Gargash, foreshadowed the influential Gulf state’s direction of travel, saying “the era of militia with sectarian and regional dimensions has cost the Arabs dearly.” An end to Iran’s proxy powerplays and a path to a Palestinian state. The question is how to get there from here, particularly as the butcher’s cleaver is ascendant over the diplomat. For now, in the absence of successful peace talks, uncertainty is the new certainty."

In addition to ongoing bloodshed in Gaza, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified across swaths of Lebanon. Israel’s ambassador to the UN said 70,000 Israeli civilians have evacuated the northern part of their country after an onslaught of Hezbollah rockets and drones. The UN reported that 90,000 Lebanese civilians have fled their homes to avoid Israeli airstrikes. Meanwhile, hospitals in Gaza continue to struggle with overwhelming casualties and a lack of resources amid Israel’s ongoing operations there. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting began in the aftermath of the Hamas incursion into Israel one year ago.

As attention shifts to Lebanon after Israeli forces escalated their attacks on the Hezbollah militant group, Israel continues to operate across Gaza and is again focusing on an area it previously said was rid of Hamas. Elsewhere in Gaza, at least 25 people are confirmed dead after Israeli airstrikes hit a mosque and a school in the center of the territory, hospital officials say. Israel said Hamas was embedded in both buildings. Israel carried out airstrikes overnight Saturday into Sunday in northern Gaza including against what the military said were “weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure sites, terrorist cells, and additional military infrastructure sites.” In a statement, the military said it had detected the presence of Hamas members there, as well as efforts by them “to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area,” and was moving forward with the operation to “dismantle.” Hamas’s military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said it was engaged in “fierce fights” with Israeli forces in northern Gaza. Jabalya is a densely populated refugee camp that was among the first places targeted early on in Israel’s response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks one year ago. CNN Related article Israel’s kibbutz Be’eri became the symbol of Hamas’ brutality. Some survivors are determined to return Dozens of families in the area have packed up their belongings and fled once again after warnings from the Israeli military of the fresh ground operation in Jabalya, which is home to Gaza’s biggest refugee camp. The Israeli military issued a fresh evacuation order for residents in northern Gaza, adding it had expanded the scope of the “humanitarian area” in Al-Mawasi. “People left their homes this morning, and they don’t know where to go, carrying some simple belongings. There are no means of transportation,” Abu Alaa Asaf, a resident of Beit Lahiya, told CNN. “We heard the sounds of explosions all night long as if the war started today,” Asaf said Some residents of northern Gaza are refusing to move, saying there is no safe place left in the enclave. Mohammad Ibrahim, 36, from Jabalya, told CNN: “I, along with my two sons, have stayed in Jabalya and will not go anywhere. There is no safe place in Gaza, and death is the same here or there.” Jabalya is home to Palestinians who have been displaced multiple times during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The camp has already been targeted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) several times during the war. In May, CNN reported that the Israeli military had renewed its fighting in northern Gaza where it had claimed, in January, to have dismantled Hamas’ command structure. During that period, the Israeli military said Hamas was trying to “reassemble” in the area, raising doubts about whether Israel’s goal of eradicating the group in the enclave is realistic. In the separate incident in central Gaza, a mosque was targeted by Israeli forces early Sunday, killing at least 25 people, while another strike on a school killed four people, hospital officials said, CNN video showed chaotic scenes as bodies were pulled from rubble after the overnight attack on the religious site in Deir el Balah, where Palestinians were sheltering. “The mosque was a shelter for displaced people, there are no militants or anything inside,” said Nabil Nadda, who was nearby when the strike happened. “Just people who have no shelter, tents, or homes so they sheltered in the mosque.” The Israeli military confirmed it carrying out strikes on both sites, calling them “precise” and said were targeting Hamas “command and control” centers. The renewed fighting comes on the eve of the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, which saw Hamas kill around 1,200 people in Israel and seize more than 250 hostages. The Israeli offensive that followed in Gaza – which Israel says is aimed at destroying Hamas – has killed more than 41,000 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/us/anti-jewish-threats-us-adl/index.html,"‘Shocking,’ historic spike in anti-Jewish threats across the US, ADL says","Threats to Jews in the United States spiked over 200% in the one-year period since the deadly October 7th terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, according to new data obtained by CNN from the Anti-Defamation League.","Oct 7, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Josh Campbell,Middle East,"CNN — Threats to Jews in the United States tripled in the one-year period since the deadly October 7 terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, preliminary data provided to CNN by the Anti-Defamation League shows. More than 10,000 antisemitic incidents occurred between October 7, 2023, and September 2024 – up from 3,325 incidents the prior year. That marks the most incidents recorded in a 12-month period by the organization since it began tracking threats in 1979. Since last October’s terrorist attack, “Jewish Americans haven’t had a single moment of respite,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “Instead, we’ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.” The new preliminary figures released ahead of an upcoming full report by the organization come as police agencies across the country have ramped up patrols around Jewish and Muslim institutions as a precaution in response to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, Monday’s October 7 anniversary and the Jewish High Holidays. Since the war between Israel and Hamas began, reports of hate crimes and bias incidents targeting Jews, Muslims and Arabs have surged across the United States. In April, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it had received 8,061 reports of anti-Muslim bias in 2023, the highest number in the 28 years the group has tracked hate. “If you see something, say something,” Greenblatt said on Sunday in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. “We need people to report incidents. We need people to speak up. We should not be afraid in our own country.” On Friday, the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint public advisory indicating the anniversary of October 7 and continued Middle East turmoil could serve as motivators for acts of violence by extremists. ADL’s threat figures included more than 150 incidents of physical assault, more than 1,840 acts of vandalism and more than 8,000 antisemitic incidents involving verbal or written harassment. The organization noted at least 1,200 antisemitic incidents occurred on US college campuses over the past year, representing a 500% spike from the previous year’s data in the same category. US colleges and universities became a flash point earlier this year after thousands of protesters took to campuses from coast to coast to demonstrate in support of Palestinians facing bombardment from Israel’s military response to the October 7 terror attack. The Gaza health ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israeli launched its war against Hamas. Israel, meanwhile, says it has killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently confirm either set of figures, in part due to limited access afforded international journalists into the conflict zone. While US college protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, several were marked by violence, including clashes with law enforcement officials attempting to clear makeshift camps, numerous reports of antisemitic intimidation of Jewish students and faculty, and instances of assaults by counter-demonstrators. “ADL’s preliminary data also found that over 3,000 of all incidents took place during anti-Israel rallies, which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,” the organization said in a statement. According to the FBI, which enforces federal hate crime laws and collects statistics on acts of violence, threats to Jews in the U.S. far exceed any other category of crimes based on religion. “The Jewish community is uniquely – uniquely – targeted by pretty much every terrorist organization across the spectrum,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray in testimony before Congress shortly after the October 7 attack. “And when you look at a group that makes up 2.4%, roughly, of the American population,” Wray said, “it should be jarring to everyone that that same population accounts for something like 60% of all religious-based hate crimes.”"

Its tiled roof has caved in, windows smashed, littering the floors with sharp shards of terracotta and glass – the debris, still untouched, of a day of horror for Israel. “This house tells the story of Be’eri,” says Yarden Tzemach, a farmer and surviving resident of the kibbutz, one of the Israeli communities near Gaza that was overrun by Hamas militants last year. “In this house, people were murdered. A family , including three children, were kidnapped from here,” he says. Outside, beneath the fruit trees in the back yard, a toddler’s ride-on toy car, adorned with stickers of Winnie the Pooh, sits amid the rubble, a stark reminder of the lives shattered here. In some neighborhoods of Be’eri, barely a building was left intact. More than 100 of its 1,100 residents were killed and another 30 abducted to Gaza on October 7. Home after home was burned out or reduced to rubble and – a year on – many remain as poignant monuments to an ongoing trauma. At least 10 residents of the kibbutz, all friends and neighbors of each other, are among the more than 100 Israelis believed to still be held hostage.

Elsewhere in the administration building, two posters are taped in a window – one showing the names and faces of the kibbutz residents who were killed, and another listing those who are held hostage. Solvy, the Be’eri finance chairman, himself an Israeli veteran of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, is one of nearly 100 residents to have so far returned. Despite his personal loss, he came back to his house three months ago and is now helping lead efforts to bring kibbutz Be’eri, formerly a self-sustaining farming community, back to life. “I said to all the people that the best recovery is coming home.

And many of those who want to come back, he says, are unable to do so until the extensive damage has been repaired and homes rebuilt – a massive renovation project that means it will be at least 2 years, according to Solvy, before the majority of residents can return home. “There is no infrastructure for kids, there are no schools, so people with families cannot come back yet,” he explains.

The conversation, scheduled to last 10 minutes, ended up going 20, according to Wa’el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action , a group aimed at boosting the Muslim American vote. Harris did not make any promises, he said, but told them “that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.” “She pledged to work with our community, include our community, and (said) that she completely understands what we’re saying. She is hopeful that if she wins, she’ll be able to deliver on all of this once she’s president,” Alzayat told CNN. Alzayat said he and other Arab American leaders in the room had been contacted and invited within the previous 48 hours. Their message to Harris was simple, he said. She needed “to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don’t agree with.” The meeting came amid increasing frustration over Harris’ response to Israel’s recent escalations in Lebanon and concerns that her campaign was not willing to hear from critical voices. Harris is hamstrung, in part, because of her position: Vice presidents do not set US foreign policy. But as the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has expanded to a multifront conflict involving Iran, which launched missiles at Israel this week , and Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and Yemen, prominent Arab American groups have been pushing for more. Leaders at the meeting told Harris there is a critical need for both expanded evacuation efforts from Lebanon and immediate humanitarian aid for US citizens and the displaced families, one of the attendees told CNN. Assad Turfe, a Lebanese American and the deputy executive of Wayne County, said the recently announced $157 million in US humanitarian aid relief for Lebanon is not enough — but that it is better than nothing. “While this is still a drop in the bucket compared to what is truly needed, it’s a start, and this $157 million can make a difference if directed properly,” Turfe told CNN in a statement. Turfe also shared his deeply personal connection to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. “In 2006, I lost both of my grandmothers to Israeli bombs during the conflict in Lebanon. Today, as the violence rages on in Lebanon and Gaza, my family is once again facing the horrors of war, with my uncle, his wife, and their children fleeing for their lives,” Turfe said.

Emgage Action endorsed Harris last month while acknowledging “ strong disappointment ” with the Biden administration’s stance on Gaza. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez were among the prominent Democrats in the room for Friday’s meeting, according to Alzayat, along with local elected officials and Edward Gabriel, the former US ambassador to Morocco who now runs the nonprofit American Task Force on Lebanon. “We want her to push the president to end the war. We want her to commit to ending the war if she becomes president. We want her to speak directly to our communities about the pain and suffering,” Alzayat said he and other outside advocates told the vice president. “We want her and we want the administration to do a better job in providing assistance to American citizens who are trapped in Lebanon.” The Harris campaign has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. According to pool reports of the Friday gathering, a campaign official said that Harris “discussed her efforts to end the war in Gaza, such that: Israel is secure, hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, self-determination.” “On Lebanon, the vice president expressed concern about civilian casualties and displacement, and reiterated the administration’s position that, ultimately, a diplomatic solution is the best path to achieve stability and protect civilians. The vice president also discussed efforts to prevent regional war,” the official said. Absent from Friday’s guest list were leaders of the “Uncommitted” movement, which sprung up during the Democratic primaries this year in opposition to the Biden administration’s policy on the war in Gaza. Harris interacted with leaders of the group in early August during a photo line at the Detroit airport. The group has called on the vice president to hold meetings with families affected by the war after her campaign and national Democrats denied the group’s previous request for a Palestinian American to speak during the Democratic convention in Chicago this summer. Uncommitted leaders have since announced that their group will not endorse Harris , though they also warned against a vote for Donald Trump or, in states where they might appear on the ballot, third-party candidates. Uncommitted movement co-founder Abbas Alawieh, a former Capitol Hill staffer, confirmed Friday that his group was not invited to the meeting with Harris. In a social media post , Alawieh said he was “glad our pressure is helping yield more engagement. What we need right now is for the @VP to specifically say that as president she will respect international humanitarian and U.S. law and stop sending the Israeli military weapons for war crimes.” John King talks with Michigan voters Anushka Jalitsagi and Jade Grey in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

He cited growing frustration with what he described as a campaign more concerned with optics than addressing the anger and anxiety among Arab American voters. Zogby was part of a Wednesday call with Harris national security adviser Phil Gordon that the White House described as a virtual gathering with “Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American community leaders” to discuss the latest developments in the Middle East. “There was no ground broken. I wasn’t quite sure what the intent was other than to just say … that they met with leaders. There were no leaders,” Zogby said of the Wednesday conversation. That call and other communications with the Harris campaign, and Biden’s before that, have irked the longtime Democratic pollster. And Israel’s escalation in Lebanon has also turned up the heat in states like Michigan, where Lebanese Americans have made up a major part of the Democratic coalition. “With Lebanon in flames, they’ve got a bigger job. And I don’t think they’re ready to handle it,” Zogby said of the Harris campaign. “It’s sort of like trying to sell a car to somebody with terminal cancer. ‘What’re you talking for? I have bigger things on my mind right now.’” Abed Ayoub, the national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said there have been “many meetings with both the campaign and administration. They know our concerns and demands.” “Our position and work is focused on bringing an immediate ceasefire, and an end to the genocide in Palestine and the war on Lebanon,” said Ayoub, who noted that his group has nearly 130,000 active voters as members, including 7,500 in Michigan. This week, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, took the campaign’s pitch to Emgage Action’s “Million Muslim Votes: A Way Forward” summit. “I know the pain of this community is deep. Our hearts are broken. The concern of the vice president and Harris and I - it’s on our minds every day. The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families fleeing for safety, over and over again,” Walz said at the virtual event.

The official added that it is “really hard to tell” if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7 attacks to retaliate. “We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees,” the official said when asked by CNN if Israel has assured the US that Iran’s nuclear sites are off the table. US officials have voiced support for Israel responding to Iran’s missile attack earlier this week, with multiple officials publicly saying there must be consequences. At the same time, officials have also voiced concerns about a regional conflagration as they grapple with an increasingly volatile Middle East. President Joe Biden said earlier this week the US would not support Israel targeting Iran’s nuclear program. “If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields,” Biden said at a press briefing Friday.

The US has been working for almost a year to prevent the conflict from turning into a bigger war – and has so far done so, the official said. Right now, “this is on the edge,” the official added. Biden said Friday that US officials are in touch with their Israeli counterparts “12 hours a day.” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that there are “major efforts on both sides to keep lines of communication open and to make sure that perspectives are understood.” “There have been moments of surprise, I don’t think that’s a secret, over the course the last couple of months,” he acknowledged. “With respect to the Iranian attack on Israel, it is not just Israel that is thinking about its response options; it is also the United States,” Campbell said at an event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Our dominant message is, ‘let’s take great care in whatever we do with respect to Iran,’” Campbell said.

The bombardment, which Israel says is targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the country, marks the world’s “most intense aerial campaign” outside of Gaza in the last two decades, according to the conflict monitoring group Airwars. Israel’s strikes are occurring at “a level and intensity that Israel’s own allies just simply would not have carried out in the last 20 years,” Emily Tripp, director of the UK-based group, told CNN. She pointed to the United States-led military campaign against ISIS in 2017, where, at the height of the battle for Raqqa – the terror group’s de facto capital – 500 munitions were deployed in a single day. Over the course of two days, on September 24 and September 25, the Israel military said it used 2,000 munitions and carried out 3,000 strikes. In comparison, for most of America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the US carried out less than 3,000 strikes a year, barring the first year of the invasion, where around 6,500 strikes were carried out – according to data from Airwars analyzed by CNN. “This isn’t normal,” Tripp said of both the scale and size of Israel’s strikes on Lebanon.  While Israel’s air campaign is extremely “unusual,” Tripp said its assault on Gaza over the last year – where nearly 60% of buildings are estimated to have been damaged from Israeli strikes – have normalized such mass assaults. Israel says it takes steps to minimize civilian harm, like making phone calls and sending text messages to residents in buildings designated for attack. Human rights groups like Amnesty International say such warnings do not absolve Israel of responsibilities under international humanitarian law to limit civilian harm. CNN has previously reported on Israel’s devastating use of 2,000-pound bombs , which experts blame for the high death toll in Gaza and appear to have been deployed in the airstrikes that killed Hezbollah’s leader , Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon. The massive munitions have impacted civilian infrastructure in Gaza and now Lebanon. CNN teams in Beirut this week found that many Israeli strikes happened without prior warning. Israel also sends evacuation orders by text in the middle of the night, when most people are sleeping. As a result, the death toll in Lebanon continues to rise, with a fifth of its population now displaced. Umm Mohammed and her five-year-old son who escaped the Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon, are now sheltering under a tarpaulin on a seaside boardwalk in Beirut. Jomana Karadsheh/CNN Hezbollah and Israel have consistently been exchanging fire since October 8, the day after the Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group, has said that it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire in Gaza – where the Israeli bombardment has killed more than 41,000 people in the past year, according to the ministry of health in the territory – is reached. The majority of the fire exchanged between Israel and Hezbollah since the start of the war has come from Israeli strikes, drones, shelling and missiles on Lebanese territory, according to data from ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data), an organization that collects data on violent conflict. Israel has launched nearly 9,000 attacks into Lebanon since October 8; Hezbollah launched 1,500 attacks in that same time frame, according to the ACLED data. On September 25, Israel further escalated its air campaign with an intense barrage of strikes across swathes of Lebanon, marking the deadliest day for Lebanon since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war – and a turning point in the current conflict. While most of Israel’s airstrikes over the past year have targeted southern Lebanon, Israel has also ramped up its attacks on Lebanon’s capital in recent weeks, with multiple airstrikes in southern Beirut flattening residential buildings and heavily populated civilian areas. A rapid succession of strikes has killed at least seven high-ranking Hezbollah commanders and officials in recent weeks, dealing the most significant blow to the group since its formation in the early 1980s. Those strikes have mostly been concentrated in the city’s southern Dahiyeh neighborhood, a densely packed residential area and Hezbollah stronghold. It was there that Israel assassinated the militant group’s leader in an air raid on his underground bunker on September 27. But as Israel’s campaign to disarm Hezbollah continues, civilians are paying the highest price, including 127 children who have been killed in less than three weeks, according to the health ministry. On September 23 alone, at least 558 people – including 50 children and 94 women – were killed. Women and girls are also particularly affected by the displacement caused by the airstrikes, according to Lebanon’s country director at the humanitarian agency CARE International. Nearly half of the people in Lebanon’s emergency shelters for displaced people are children, and the facilities are operating beyond capacity, Michael Adams said. Now, Israel is targeting central Beirut  – not its suburbs – with airstrikes for the first time in nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, a quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military evacuation orders​ as Israel intensifies its ground operation in the south, with its inhabitants pushed more than 30 miles north of their homes. More than 100 villages in southern Lebanon have now been issued the evacuation notices, stoking fears of an expanded ground invasion. Residents have no idea when they might be able to return - or what they might find remaining. CNN’s Allegra Goodwin, Eyad Kourdi and Soph Warnes contributed to this report."

But we’d always admire the view and say: ‘When? When is it going to come?’” the 32-year-old software engineer told CNN. “We always thought that the October 7 (attack) would happen here, we always talked about it,” he said, rolling a cigarette outside a hotel on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, about 40 miles from Kiryat Shmona. Pinhas’ parents and his elderly grandmother have been living in this hotel for almost a year, ever since they were evacuated from Kiryat Shmona following the October 7 terror attacks.

Ivana Kottasova/CNN Kiryat Shmona, which sits in a pocket of Israeli land surrounded by Lebanon, just a couple of miles to the south and east from the border, sits on the opposite side of Israel to where the Hamas-led attacks took place last year. But its proximity to Lebanon makes it vulnerable to Hezbollah , the Iran-backed militant group that has been attacking Israel on a regular basis over the past year, in support of Hamas. Israel has responded with cross-border attacks and the two sides have been engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation since October 8. Hezbollah has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. The city was hit multiple times in recent months, most recently by a barrage of rockets that caused heavy damage and several fires on Friday morning, according to Israeli police.

What Israel does next will be pivotal But Pinhas told CNN it wasn’t the rockets that forced him and his family to evacuate their homes. There have always been rocket attacks in Kiryat Shmona. “When I was growing up, it wasn’t just sirens like now… it was someone blaring from a car, ‘everybody get to shelters! Everybody get to shelters!’ And in school, when the alarm went off, nobody was freaking out because we were used to it,” he said. “Everybody goes into the shelter, you hear the bombs and then wait for somebody to tell you it’s safe to leave,” he explained, adding that while the locals have gotten used to attacks from the skies, there has always been the worry that Hezbollah could try to storm them from the ground. “There was a warning some months before October 7, saying you need to know that the next war won’t be just rockets. They will come here. There are a lot of tunnels, and we need to prepare ourselves… and we didn’t. People are stupid. Until something happens, you don’t really act,” he said. But then came the shock of the terror attacks, when Hamas and other militant groups killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped some 250 more into Gaza . “Everything has changed then,” Pinhas said. “We thought our army was strong and prepared and suddenly you see this, shooting everywhere. I had three friends who were at the Nova festival , one of them died, two were saved,” he said. Yair Pinhas visits his family at the hotel where they have been living for almost a year after being evacuated from Kiryat Shmona. Ivana Kottasova/CNN ‘There will be a lot of deaths’ The Israeli government said the fate of people like Pinhas is among the reasons why it needs to act forcefully against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly meeting last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah had fired more than 8,000 rockets at Israel since October 8, forcing some 60,000 people to flee their homes along the border. “Israel has been tolerating this intolerable situation for nearly a year. Well, I’ve come here today to say enough is enough. We won’t rest until our citizens can return safely to their homes,” he said. Shortly after Netanyahu spoke at the UN, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a deadly strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut, targeting and killing Hezbollah’s long term leader Hassan Nasrallah .

(AP Photo/Baz Ratner) Baz Ratner/AP Related article With Hezbollah weakened, Israel’s challenge becomes knowing when to pull back Three days later, the IDF said it was launching a “limited and localized” ground operation in Lebanon. The IDF’s top spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the move was designed to prevent an October-7 style attack by Hezbollah and “to enable all 60,000 Israelis to safely return back to their homes in northern Israel.” But at least some of the people whose fates Netanyahu invoked during his speech are questioning the decision. Speaking to CNN on her terrace in the village of Shtula, Ora Hatan said she was worried the fight in the hills around the border might prove too costly for Israel. “I think that it’s very dangerous for the army to go to Lebanon, because there are many, many traps… I think that we can protect the border by plane. Or go (in) and come back… But not stay (in Lebanon), it’s too dangerous,” she said. Hatan, whose house overlooks the Lebanese border, has lived in Shtula her whole life. She said that she’s worried current warfare is much more deadly than it was in 2006,  the last time Israel invaded Lebanon. Pinhas, too, is conflicted about Israel’s decision to cross the border. “It’s very hard. On (the) one hand, I can say, yes, you’re right, because we need to go back home and we need to bring peace to our town. So my first thought is we need to do something about it, because their (Hezbollah’s) main purpose is to kill us,” he said. Ora Hatan speaks on the phone at her house near the Israeli border with Lebanon. Ivana Kottasová/CNN “But the other thing that I’m feeling, and everybody’s feeling that, is that this is very dangerous, and there will be a lot of deaths. Hezbollah, they know very well their territory there, this is their playground. This is not like in 2006, this is not a small group, we gave them a lot of time to prepare themselves and get a lot of ammunition,” he added, referencing the 2006 Israeli invasion into Lebanon which lasted 34 days and ended in a stalemate after killing some 1,100 people on the Lebanese side and about 170 Israelis. For Lebanon, this war is already deadlier. At least 1,401 people have been killed in the country since September 17 when Israel began its current bombardment, according to a CNN count based on information from the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Around 1 million people have been displaced, according to the minister in charge of Lebanon’s crisis management center. The Israeli offensive is among the most intense in decades, surpassed only by its bombing of Gaza.

A city of some 22,000, Kiryat Shmona has turned into a ghost town over the past year. Signs of destruction are clearly visible throughout its streets – shrapnel holes in facades, damage caused by falling debris, destruction caused by direct hits by rockets. On Thursday, marking the Jewish new year, the Pinhas family snuck back into Kiryat Shmona for a brief visit. “To water the plants and feed the cats. There are many street cats in Kiryat Shmona and they need feeding,” Pinhas said. Several rockets were fired at the city from Lebanon on Thursday but were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defense systems, the bright light of interceptor missiles popping up in the skies and chasing away the threat. A black and white cat, meanwhile, continued to rummage through the pile of debris lying in front of a family home destroyed in an earlier rocket attack."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/economy/israel-economy-war-impact/index.html,Israel’s economy is paying a high price for its widening war,The damage to Israel’s economy from its prolonged war against Hamas is worsening as the conflict nears the one-year mark and spills over into the wider region.,"Oct 4, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Hanna Ziady,Middle East,"London CNN — In late September, as Israel’s nearly year-long war widened and its credit rating was downgraded yet again, the country’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that, while Israel’s economy was under strain, it was resilient. “Israel’s economy bears the burden of the longest and most expensive war in the country’s history,” Smotrich said on September 28, a day after Israeli airstrikes killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon’s capital Beirut, ratcheting fears that tensions with the militant group would turn into a full-blown conflict. “The Israeli economy is a strong economy that even today attracts investments.” Almost a year after Hamas’ deadly attack on October 7, Israel is pushing forward on multiple fronts: launching a ground incursion against Hezbollah in Lebanon, carrying out airstrikes in Gaza and Beirut , and threatening retaliation for Iran’s ballistic missile attack earlier this week. As the conflict spills over into the wider region , the economic costs will spiral too, both for Israel and other countries in the Middle East. “If recent escalations turn into a longer and more intense war, this will take a heavier toll on economic activity and growth (in Israel),” Karnit Flug, a former governor of Israel’s central bank, told CNN on October 1. The war has significantly worsened the situation in Gaza, pushing it into an economic and humanitarian crisis long ago, and the West Bank is “undergoing a rapid and alarming economic decline,” the United Nations said in a report last month. The Lebanese economy, meanwhile, could contract by up to 5% this year due to cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, according to BMI, a market research firm owned by Fitch Solutions. Israel’s economy could shrink even more than that, based on a worst-case estimate by the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. Even in a more benign scenario, its researchers also see Israel’s gross domestic product per head — which in recent years overtook the United Kingdom’s — falling this year, as Israel’s population grows faster than the economy and living standards decline. Before the October 7 attack and ensuing Israel-Hamas war, the International Monetary Fund forecast that Israel’s economy would grow by an enviable 3.4% this year. Now, economists’ projections range from 1% to 1.9%. Growth next year is also expected to be weaker than earlier forecasts. Yet Israel’s central bank is not in a position to cut interest rates to breathe life into the economy because inflation is accelerating, propelled by rising wages and soaring government spending to fund the war. ‘Long-term’ economic damage The Bank of Israel estimated in May that costs arising from the war would total 250 billion shekels ($66 billion) through the end of next year, including military outlays and civilian expenses, such as on housing for thousands of Israelis forced to flee their homes in the north and south. That is equivalent to roughly 12% of Israel’s GDP. Those costs look set to rise further as fiercer fighting with Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, adds to the government’s defense bill and delays the return of Israelis to their homes in the country’s north. Israel launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah on September 30. Smotrich, the finance minister, is confident that Israel’s economy will bounce back once the war ends, but economists are concerned the damage will far outlast the conflict. Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, pictured in June 2024. Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images Flug, the former Bank of Israel governor and now vice-president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute, says there is a risk the Israeli government cuts investment to free up resources for defense. “That will reduce the potential growth (of the economy) going forward,” she said. Researchers at the Institute for National Security Studies are similarly downbeat. Even a withdrawal from Gaza and calm on the border with Lebanon ﻿would leave Israel’s economy in a weaker position than before the war, they said in a report in August. “Israel is expected to suffer long-term economic damage regardless of the outcome,” they wrote. “The anticipated decline in growth rates in all scenarios compared to pre-war economic forecasts and the increase in defense expenditures could exacerbate the risk of a recession reminiscent of the lost decade following the Yom Kippur War.” The 1973 war, also known as the Arab-Israeli war, launched by Egypt and Syria against Israel’s forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, ushered in a long period of economic stagnation in Israel, partly as the country massively ramped up defense spending. Likewise, potential tax hikes and cuts to non-defense spending — some already mooted by Smotrich — to fund what many expect to become a permanently enlarged military, could hurt economic growth. Such measures, coupled with a weakened sense of security, could also spur an exodus of highly educated Israelis, notably tech entrepreneurs, Flug warned. “It doesn’t have to be in very large numbers, because the tech sector is very dependent on a few thousand of the most innovative, creative and entrepreneurial individuals,” she said of a sector that accounts for a hefty 20% of Israel’s economic output. A Jewish man walks past closed shops in Jerusalem's Old City on September 11, 2024. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images A large-scale departure of high-earning taxpayers would further dent Israel’s finances, which have taken a knock from the war. The government has delayed publishing a budget for next year as it grapples with competing demands that make it hard to balance its books. The conflict has caused Israel’s budget deficit — the difference between government spending and revenue, mostly from taxes — to double to 8% of GDP, from 4% before the war. Government borrowing has soared and become more expensive, as investors demand higher returns to buy Israeli bonds and other assets. Multiple downgrades to Israel’s credit ratings made by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are likely to raise the country’s cost of borrowing even further. In late August — a month before Israel carried out strikes on Lebanon’s capital and the ground incursion against Hezbollah in the country’s south — the Institute for National Security Studies estimated that just one month of “high-intensity warfare” in Lebanon against the militant group, with “intensive attacks” in the opposite direction that damage Israeli infrastructure, could cause Israel’s budget deficit to soar to 15% and its GDP to contract by up to 10% this year. Uncertainty ‘the biggest factor’ To shrink the fiscal hole, the government can’t rely on a healthy flow of tax revenue from businesses, many of which are collapsing, while others are reluctant to invest while it’s unclear how long the war will last. Coface BDi, a major business analytics company in Israel, estimates that 60,000 Israeli firms will shut this year, up from an annual average of around 40,000. Most of these are small, with up to five employees. “Uncertainty is just bad for the economy, bad for investment,” said Avi Hasson, the CEO of Startup Nation Central, a non-profit that promotes Israel’s tech industry globally. In a recent report, Hasson warned that the remarkable resilience of Israel’s tech sector so far “will not be sustainable” in the face of the uncertainty created by the prolonged conflict and the government’s “destructive” economic policy. Even before the October 7 attack, government plans to weaken the judiciary were prompting some Israeli tech companies to incorporate in the United States . The insecurity created by the war has exacerbated that trend, with most new tech companies formally registered overseas, despite tax incentives to incorporate locally, and a large number considering moving some of their operations outside Israel, Hasson told CNN last month. He remains bullish on Israeli tech, pointing to robust fundraising, but cautions that the industry’s future growth “depends on regional stability and responsible government policies.” Apartment blocks and office buildings under construction in Tel Aviv in August 2024. Florion Goga/Reuters Other sectors of Israel’s economy, while less important than tech, have been hit much harder. The agriculture and construction sectors have struggled to fill gaps left by Palestinians whose work permits have been suspended since October last year, pushing up prices for fresh vegetables and leading to a steep decline in housebuilding. Tourism has also taken a knock, with arrivals down sharply this year. Israel’s tourism ministry has estimated that the drop in foreign tourists has translated into 18.7 billion shekels ($4.9 billion) in lost revenue since the start of the war. The Norman, a boutique hotel in Tel Aviv, has had to lay off some staff and cut its prices by up to 25%, partly because some of its facilities — including its Japanese rooftop restaurant — remain closed to save on costs. Occupancy levels have fallen from above 80% before war to below 50% currently, according to the hotel’s general manager Yaron Liberman. “We know the day when the war will finish it’s going to be crazy here as far as business coming back,” he told CNN in mid-September, citing correspondence from would-be guests keen to visit Israel but unable to book flights or secure travel insurance. But for now, “the biggest factor is the uncertainty,” Liberman said. “When is the war going to end?”"

For nearly a week, Israel has been bombarding Hezbollah-dominated residential neighborhoods in the southern suburbs of Beirut. But this strike in a Shia quarter near the parliament building – a part of the city that has been spared since the 2006 war with Israel – signaled that the scope of Israel’s campaign may be quickly expanding. Windows across the skyline lit up just as the crash and boom of the missile roused people from sleep. A dark plume of smoke rose from the heart of the capital — people frantically called their loved ones as they tried to work out where Israel’s bombs had hit this time. The strike had bombed an office belonging to the Islamic Health Authority, affiliated with Hezbollah, in the central Bashura neighborhood, killing nine people including seven medics, according to the health ministry and the Islamic Health Authority itself. On the street impacted by the strike, people wandered in a daze. Women cradled babies in their arms, as they weaved through the carnage. Unlike the southern suburbs and other parts of the country, there was no warning to evacuate this Shia-majority neighborhood. Down the road is the Mohammad al-Amin mosque, a colossal landmark in the city, now an emblem for the constant state of movement of the roughly 1 million people displaced by Israel’s air offensive in Lebanon which began last Monday. Families fleeing the central Beirut strike on Thursday streamed into the mosque’s grounds. Just as they arrived, many of those who had already been camped out there were packing up their belongings to flee again. The newly displaced were replacing those already made homeless, who were now seeking safer grounds north of the city. Smoke billows over Beirut after overnight Israeli air strikes on October 3, 2024. Joseph Campbell/Reuters “The whole mosque shook. People ran away thinking they were going to be bombed,” said a middle-aged women named Fatima. She sat on a folded up cardboard box, leaning against a column. “And just as they fled, others came.” “If I weren’t so sick, I would have left too. But I don’t have the energy to be displaced again.” The Mostafa family from the southern Beirut suburbs share three mattresses amongst themselves amid the mosque’s looming colonnades. “I can’t afford to leave this place,” said Mostafa Mostafa. “Isn’t it such a shame, what’s happened? We were a proud Lebanese family with a roof over our heads. Our home gave us dignity. Now look at the state of us.” Fears of mission creep Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has killed over 1,300 people since it began on September 17, according to a CNN tally of Lebanon’s health ministry statements. Israel’s war cabinet said it aimed to repatriate 60,000 people displaced by Hezbollah’s rocket fire in the country’s northern-most territory. Hezbollah for its part said it would only agree to a ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border when the Israeli offensive in Gaza ends. Israel says that its strikes have targeted Hezbollah’s weapons depots, command and control structures and its general infrastructure. But many of those killed are believed to be civilians, according to the health ministry which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. An air warfare expert told CNN that the ferocity of the campaign in Lebanon already matches that of Gaza, where a ground, air and naval offensive levelled large parts of the besieged strip. The war here may have just arrived at yet another dangerous juncture. Israel has amassed its troops on the border and begun its ground war. It has rained down artillery and drone strikes on the area, forcing people to flee as the Israeli military seek to pave the way for an invasion of the south of the country and establish a establish a buffer zone.

According to multiple reports, Israeli forces have breached the armistice line between Lebanon and Israel several times in the last two days, conducting raids and enduring fatalities, and then withdrawing Meanwhile Israel’s targeting of Hezbollah’s civilian arms, such as the health authority on Thursday morning and its media center later in the afternoon, widened the scope of its stated goals to destroy the Iran-backed group’s command and control as well as its arsenal. It has raised the specter of mission creep, thrusting the country, no stranger to conflict and crises, into uncharted waters. “We are now literally paralyzed. We cannot do anything,” said Mahdi, an alumnus of the American University of Beirut, a five minute drive from the site of the attack on the Islamic Health Authority.

As we remain extremely shocked by what is happening, and our thoughts are with those who are suffering, we urge all parties to restore peace to the region with immediate effect.” CNN has reached out to both the Palestine Football Association (PFA) and the Israel Football Association (IFA) for comment on the decision. The PFA called for FIFA to ban the IFA, its national teams and club teams earlier this year. The original PFA motion was tabled in April before being raised at FIFA’s Congress in May with a decision expected in July. The timeframe for a decision was then delayed multiple times before Thursday’s announcement. FIFA did not disclose when it would announce results of the investigation. The PFA argued that the IFA should be banned from world football because of the “violation of international law through the occupation of the Gaza Strip; Racism and discrimination against Palestinian athletes in two Israeli clubs and violation of FIFA statutes through the league participation of five Israeli clubs from illegal settlements on Palestinian territory.” These claims have been rejected by the IFA. FIFA charged an independent panel to pull together evidence which was presented on Thursday to the 37 members of the FIFA council. The FIFA council said it adopted two conclusions and recommendations following today’s hearing. “The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offence of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,” the outcome read. “The FIFA Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate – and subsequently advise the FIFA Council on – the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.” Both men’s national teams are in action next week. Palestine plays Iraq in World Cup qualifying on October 10 and Israel plays France in the Nations League on the same day."

Seven people were killed and 16 wounded in the attack on Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, a port neighborhood in southern Tel Aviv, according to Israeli Police. The incident happened just minutes before Iran launched a barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, its largest-ever such attack , sending sirens blaring across the country and residents running to bomb shelters. Video posted online showed Lev Kreitman, who served six months as a reservist with the Israeli military in Gaza, firing a gun at an unknown target before running away. The footage was filmed from a nearby building in Jaffa and appears to show Kreitman wearing a pink shirt, white shorts and flip flops. In another video, Kreitman was seen walking in the background among Israeli soldiers who were at the scene of the attack. Speaking to CNN affiliate Channel 11, Kreitman said he had been carrying his personal handgun after his time with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Recalling Tuesday’s incident, he said how he spotted what he described as “two terrorists,” one moving toward him. “The other goes somewhere else, runs somewhere else, and I’m here, right where we’re standing, I surprised him from the side, shoot,” Kreitman said, adding he understood straight away it was an attack. “I tried to do my best in the very crazy situation, amid alarms, missiles, and interceptions in the sky,” he said.

The trance festival in southern Israel’s Negev Desert was one target of the militant group’s rampage in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others kidnapped and taken to Gaza. Israel’s ensuing war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 people, created a humanitarian catastrophe and left much of the Palestinian enclave in ruins. Police said Wednesday that two gunmen had begun their “killing spree” by opening fire on passengers aboard a light rail car that had stopped at a station in Jaffa. They had then continued their attack on foot on Jerusalem Boulevard, according to police. The attackers were stopped by security forces and civilians who used personal guns, police added. “They had an M-16 type weapon, cartridges and a knife in their possession,” police said in a statement. Medics said they treated victims at several sites on Jerusalem Boulevard, including near train tracks, in the street, at a synagogue and in a butcher’s shop. The injured were taken to hospitals while air-raid alarms sounded in the region and throughout Israel.

American officials are not privately trying to persuade Israel to hold back on retaliating against Iran, two senior administration officials told CNN, a notable difference from April when Biden encouraged Israel to “take the win” following the successful interception of a barrage of Iranian drones and missiles. Instead, Biden hopes Israel will adopt a measured approach that can both uphold its right to strike back while avoiding action that could prompt further retaliation and tip the region into full-scale war. “No one’s saying don’t respond,” one senior administration official said. “No one’s saying, ‘Take the win.’” How that message will be received by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains to be seen, particularly as his political standing appears more assured following successful efforts to degrade Hezbollah in Lebanon. “Iran made a big mistake, and it will pay for it,” he said at the start of a security cabinet meeting Tuesday. Biden’s efforts at influencing his Israeli counterpart over the past year have been largely ineffective, and the two men have not spoken since August. Biden told reporters Wednesday he plans to speak to Netanyahu “relatively soon,” but didn’t appear to have a conversation on the books. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said discussions with Israel are ongoing and highlighted the risks of the situation. “The region is really balancing on a knife’s edge and real concerns about an even broader escalation … which could imperil not just Israel, but our strategic interests as well,” Campbell said Wednesday. The stakes of the moment could not be higher. Biden has watched with mounting concern as tensions in the region have spiraled. Attempts at brokering ceasefire agreements both in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border have been largely fruitless. And the pending American presidential election has elevated the stakes of trying to manage the crisis. The scale of Tuesday’s attack far outstripped the shower of projectiles Iran fired toward Israel in April. Israel and the United States were again successful in thwarting the missiles, in part due to a monthslong effort at coordinating a response. But the scale of the attack, which Biden called “brazen” in the hours after it happened, led American officials to conclude that a response from Israel was warranted. “Israel has a right to respond. It should be a proportional response,” Biden told reporters Wednesday following a virtual call with leaders from the Group of 7 industrialized nations. He said the leaders were in agreement on that point and were preparing to slap new sanctions on Iran. That is a different tone than mid-April, when US officials encouraged Israel to recognize that Iran had inflicted limited damage and urged them move on. Israel did respond against Iran, but in a limited way, striking an air defense system in Isfahan. Now, a bigger Israeli counterattack is expected that could include a range of targets. The administration currently assesses it’s unlikely Israel would target Iran’s nuclear sites, though one senior official said Israel still hasn’t decided on where it might strike. ‘Taking a beat and thinking about it’ “They are doing the smart thing and taking a beat and thinking about it,” the official said. Biden said Wednesday he does not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. “The answer is no,” he responded when questioned about the prospect of Israel launching a retaliatory strike on sites related to Iran’s nuclear program. Such a decision by Israel would almost certainly trigger the out-of-control conflict Biden has been working to prevent in the year since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7. For Netanyahu and some his most hawkish advisers, however, it could eliminate what is viewed as an existential threat to Israel once and for all. In the aftermath of this week’s attacks, the US is closely monitoring any activity surrounding Iran’s nuclear program, but they have not seen any recent changes, two US officials said. A central US concern is the possibility of Iran turning to bolster its nuclear program after Israel successfully degraded its proxies in Lebanon and Gaza and foiled its ballistic missile attack. While there are no signals currently that Iran will do that, or is planning to, US officials are still monitoring for the possibility of such a move. There has not been a dramatic shift in Iran’s nuclear posture recently, though over the last year Iran has further produced fissile material for its nuclear program. Earlier this year Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Iran’s breakout time – the amount of time needed to produce enough nuclear material for a nuclear weapon – “is now probably one or two weeks.” No Israelis were hurt or killed in Tuesday’s Iranian attack, which appeared to target military and intelligence facilities. One Palestinian man was killed in the West Bank by falling shrapnel from an interceptor missile launched by Israel, according to the hospital where he was treated. With the two-day Jewish new year holiday Rosh Hashanah starting on Wednesday, there is some expectation an Israeli reprisal could still be days away. “They have the holiday so that buys time and space,” one of the senior US officials said. Yet waiting days for a response also has the effect of prolonging anticipation in a region already on a razor’s edge, especially as Israel’s operation against Hezbollah continues. CNN reported Wednesday that US officials and Israeli believe about 50% of the Iranian proxy group’s arsenal has been destroyed. Inside the White House, there is acute recognition that how the next weeks play out will have some effect on the presidential election. There is little Vice President Kamala Harris — the Democratic nominee — wants less than a full-scale regional war that her opponent can use to accuse the Biden administration of incompetence. A close observer of American politics, Netanyahu is similarly aware of how Israel’s actions in the coming weeks could impact the race. Some Western officials believe he sees an opening in the high-stakes political moment to take decisive action against Iran, aware that Biden and Harris have faced criticism from all sides on their handling of the war. For her part, Harris emerged Tuesday afternoon to read a carefully worded statement about the Iranian strikes in Israel. “I’m clear eyed,” she said, not diverting from prepared remarks. “Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East, and today’s attack on Israel only further demonstrates that fact.”"

The conflict would not be contained in Gaza, the thinking went – Hezbollah would attack Israel from the north, the Houthis from Yemen, and Iranian proxies from Iraq. Israel would be forced to respond, it would come into direct conflict with Iran, and the wider war would be upon us. Nearly one year later, all those things have come to pass. A day after Iran launched its largest ever ballistic missile attack on Israel – and as Israeli troops battle Hezbollah fighters on the ground in Lebanon – regional war is effectively here. The big question now is: Will it escalate, or cool? Israel’s leaders stand at a juncture. When Iran first staged a missile attack in April, in retaliation for an Israeli strike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Israel was restrained, striking only an Iranian air defense installation in response. But Iran’s attack on Tuesday night was unprecedented in its ferocity. Despite some strikes on Israeli bases, damage was minimal, nearly all missiles were intercepted, and one person – a Palestinian man struck by shrapnel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank – was killed. Israel now faces a choice, a former senior Israeli military official told CNN: “Are you responding to the intention or to the results?” Iran’s government has “absolutely no interest in a broader war,” government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Wednesday, adding that the country restrained itself after the assassination in July of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran “despite demands” from its people to respond. Israelis take cover as projectiles launched from Iran are intercepted in the skies over Rosh Haayin. Maya Alleruzzo/AP Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ridden a string of assassinations around the Middle East to a remarkable political rehabilitation. Israel’s bombing campaign in Lebanon has devastated the civilian population – displacing more than 1 million people – but has achieved a long-coveted goal of at least temporarily neutering a persistent threat to the north. Why not seize the moment to weaken the patron state itself, Iran? “The elimination of Nasrallah is a necessary condition in achieving the objectives we have set: Returning the residents of the north safely to their homes and changing the balance of power in the region for years,” Netanyahu said in the wake of a massive strike in Beirut last month that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Two days later, he addressed Iranians themselves, saying, “when Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, everything will be different.” His stance is in tune with Israeli public opinion too. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is leading the charge pushing for a maximalist response to Tehran’s attack, proposing that Israel bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, which the US and others say are responsible for a weapons program, a charge Iran has long denied. “Sometimes history knocks on your door and you’ve got to seize the moment,” he told CNN on Tuesday . “If we don’t do it now, I don’t see it ever happening.” Iran’s two arms to fight Israel – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – “are temporarily paralyzed,” Bennett said. “So it’s like a boxer out in the ring without arms for the next few minutes. Now is the time that we can attack, because Iran is fully vulnerable.” Smoke rises following Israel's bombardment in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. Baz Ratner/AP That response, of course, carries with it the danger of the unknown. Hezbollah is certainly weakened, but no one knows for certain how much capacity it still has. The US government believes that Iran could build a bomb in just weeks once it decides to do so. Short of the nuclear option, Tehran has other ways of applying further pressure on Israel and its allies. Escalating responses could spiral completely out of anyone’s control and drag allies into the fight. The former senior Israeli military official explained that “there are always schools of thought.” Bennett’s, according to the official, is that “it’s time to neutralize the whole axis of evil. We started with Hamas, then Hezbollah. It is now the time for Iran, maybe Syria.” The former official said they had no direct knowledge of Israel’s plans but requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “Last night it seemed to me like it was going to be an overwhelming response,” they said. “This morning, I am getting messages that they are taking the time to think.” A more restrained response would see Israel target a military facility, as Iran did on Tuesday in Israel. “You could hit infrastructure, very similar to what happened in Yemen,” the former official, referring to an Israeli bombing campaign on the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah on Sunday. “National export of oil, or anything else.” The unknown factor is how far Israel’s most important ally – the United States – will go in supporting its response. “We have made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday. “It is too early for me to tell you anything publicly in terms of our assessment or in terms of what our expectations are of the Israelis or the advice that we would give them.”"

Officials told CNN the increased police presence at key locations is out of an abundance of caution as a deterrent and was not based on any specific threats. Despite the lack of any known credible threats, law enforcement officials have described the potential for violence from so-called “lone wolf” attackers as among their most serious concerns during what they have described as a heightened threat environment . The increased patrols come as Rosh Hashanah – which is the first of the high holidays and considered the Jewish New Year – is set to begin at sunset Wednesday and end at nightfall Friday. Next week, Yom Kippur , the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, will be celebrated beginning Friday at sunset through nightfall on Saturday. The NYPD assumed an increased patrol posture on Monday, a law enforcement source told CNN, which is expected to be maintained throughout the next two weeks. NYPD will also partner with state police for explosive detection missions at bridges and tunnels, and helicopter units will be used for radiation detection, the source said. Los Angeles police department leaders recently participated in a security town hall with Jewish community leaders in Southern California to discuss the ramping up of patrols during the religious holidays. The LAPD has routinely increased its presence at both Jewish and Muslim houses of worship based on turmoil in the Middle East. At the town hall last week, the LAPD said its patrols would include an increased number of officers on the beat, command post vehicles, and horse mounted units. The meeting was intended to reassure members of the Jewish community, many of whom have expressed concerns about security after an anti-Semitic attack in the city last year where two men were shot leaving a Jewish synagogue by a man who was sentenced Monday to 35 years in federal prison. Chicago police said the department plans to give “special attention to houses of worship” and will be monitoring all activity. “While there is no actionable intelligence at this time, we will have an increased police presence to ensure the city’s faith communities are not only safe, but feel safe,” said the department in a statement. Asked about Tuesday’s attack on Israel, a spokesperson for the Miami Beach Police Department said it had “heightened our uniformed presence across the city to ensure public safety.” The Philadelphia Police Department told CNN it was closely monitoring the situation in Israel “and assessing any potential impacts on our local community. Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken proactive measures, including increased patrols around local Jewish and Islamic places of worship and community centers, to ensure the safety of all community members.” In addition to law enforcement agencies, national Jewish security organizations have been working to identify any potential threats to houses of worship in the US. “What we have previously told Jewish institutions is that at this time, there is no known credible threat to the Jewish Community in the U.S.,” said Oren Segal, Vice President of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, adding the organization recommends places of worship remain open during the high holidays. “However, given the heightened tensions and increased risk to the community at this time, we recommend institutions review and implement a series of security precautions and procedures,” Segal said.

Here’s what we know,"The Middle East is edging ever closer toward a full-blown regional war as Israel vowed to respond to Iran’s huge barrage of ballistic missiles fired at the country on Tuesday night, capping a day of dramatic military escalation in the region.","Oct 2, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Helen Regan,Middle East,"CNN — The Middle East is edging ever closer toward a full-blown regional war as Israel vowed to respond to Iran’s huge barrage of ballistic missiles fired at the country on Tuesday night, capping a day of dramatic military escalation in the region. “Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said hours after the unprecedented attack. Iran launched a salvo of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets, its largest ever such attack, sending sirens blaring across Israel and activating the country’s sophisticated defensive systems. Iran’s leadership said the attack was intended as a warning to Israel not to enter a direct war with its longtime enemy, and any Israeli response to the barrage would be met with “stronger and more painful” blows. The escalation came about 24 hours after Israel launched a ground war in Lebanon to go after Hezbollah, a powerful militant group that is backed by Iran, and days after Israel killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah in a strike on Beirut. Here’s what we know. Regional war widens Tuesday’s attack has further changed the dynamics of the conflict, transitioning from a war involving Iran’s proxies toward a direct confrontation between two regional military powerhouses. An Israeli military source told CNN several Iranian missiles struck Israeli military bases during the attack, but insisted there was no major damage to the facilities. It’s the second time Iran has launched an aerial attack on Israel this year, but Tuesday’s barrage was of a different magnitude. In April, Iran launched a large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel – the first such direct assault on the country from its soil – in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria. Israel's anti-missile system intercepts rockets after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, on October 1, 2024. Amir Cohen/Reuters Iran gave 72 hours notice ahead of that attack, which was widely seen as designed to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle with almost all of the 300 projectiles knocked out of the sky by Israel’s defense systems. Israel responded a week later with a limited strike on Iran. This time, Israel learned about the imminent threat just hours before Tehran launched the strikes, with targets including the headquarters of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, in Tel Aviv, Israel’s second largest city, Nevatim Air Base and Tel Nof Air Base. Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran’s Tuesday barrage was twice as large as the April attack. It also included many more ballistic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, posing a real threat to Israeli citizens – many of whom evacuated to shelters during the attack. While the Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, some landed on Israeli soil and appeared to cause damage. Shock waves caused by the attack also damaged homes in central Israel, authorities in the country said. Has diplomacy in the Middle East failed? Diplomacy has so far failed to broker a deal between Israel and Hezbollah, and the ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Hamas and Israel have floundered. Even until a few weeks ago, some senior US officials privately believed that through its diplomatic and deterrence efforts, Washington had helped to successfully thwart a large-scale Iranian attack against Israel, sources told CNN. “I think Nasrallah was the final straw” for Iran, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. With no off-ramp, and Israel appearing unwilling to compromise with its regional enemies, Tuesday’s attack is perhaps the clearest sign a much-feared regional war may be about to ignite. Meanwhile, both Israel and the US downplayed the effectiveness of the strike. Israel said the attack “failed.” How we got here In almost a year of war, increasing escalations have repeatedly brought the region to the edge of an all-out conflict. In recent days, Israel’s ground incursion into southern Lebanon opened up a whole new front and it has ramped up attacks against other Iran-backed militants, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen. Israel has eliminated Hezbollah’s leadership with a series of attacks and massive airstrikes across Lebanon that have targeted the group’s infrastructure and capabilities, but which have also killed more than 1,000 people, displaced about 1 million, and destroyed homes and neighborhoods.

Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images In Gaza, Israel’s war against Hamas grinds on almost a year after the Palestinian militant group’s attack on Israel. The ensuing war has killed more than 41,000 people, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and left much of the enclave in ruins. Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are all part of an Iranian-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war began. They say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. What might both sides do next? Iran has attempted to characterize its attack as a calibrated response to repeated escalations from Israel. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Tuesday’s missile strikes focused on Israeli security and military targets and was in response to Israel’s killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, including Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran in July. Following the assassination of Hamas’ most public figure after attending the inauguration of Iran’s new president, the world held its breath as it waited to see how Tehran would respond. For months, that response never came and tensions appeared to de-escalate given the grave consequences of an all-out war in the Middle East. But Israel’s assassinations and the widening war in Lebanon has rapidly changed that equation. In this screengrab taken from a video, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a meeting with his political-security Cabinet on October 1, 2024. PMO On Saturday, Netanyahu gave a fiery speech directed at Iran, saying Israel was “changing the balance of power in the region” and that “there is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach.” Nasrallah’s death was necessary, he said, to returning thousands of residents to their homes along the Lebanon border displaced by Hezbollah rocket attacks, and to prevent the group from launching a large-scale attack on Israel. US officials have long assessed that both Iran and senior Hezbollah leadership has wanted to avoid all-out war with Israel, even as both have exchanged fire. One big fear for US and Arab diplomats is the possibility of Israel striking inside Iran, potentially against its nuclear facilities. Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett urged Israel to retaliate by destroying its nuclear program. But Iran has made clear that any response from Israel would result in further escalation. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said Tuesday’s operation was “only a portion of our power.” Israel is likely eyeing Iran’s nuclear facilities as it determines its response to Tehran’s missile attack, according to Malcolm Davis, senior analyst for defense strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “From Israel’s perspective, it cannot allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. There would certainly be strong pressure within Netanyahu’s cabinet to attack those nuclear facilities and essentially set back the Iranian nuclear weapons program, potentially for years,” Davis told CNN’s Becky Anderson. And Hezbollah itself also remains a dangerous adversary for Israel with an arsenal of military assets it could bring to bear. However, Salam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, believes Tehran is likely hoping “there will be some restraint.” “Iran is trying to throw down some red lines, knowing full well that it is in a defensive position, that Hezbollah is compromised, and that it doesn’t have the traditional conventional capabilities to fight Israel,” he told CNN’s Anderson.

US Navy destroyers fired interceptors against the Iranian missiles and in recent weeks, the US has moved more of its troop s and warships to the region. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began, US troops have also been the target of escalating attacks by Iran-backed proxy groups. In January, three US Army soldiers were killed and more than 30 service members injured in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan. During that time, the US has repeatedly stood firm with Israel. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US will “never hesitate” to protect US forces and interest in the Middle East, and that the US remains ready and “postured” to defend its own forces and Israel.

The aerial assault, far more serious than a similar strike in April, has raised the stakes in what is already an extremely tense moment across the Middle East as a dangerous regional conflict spirals. Here’s a look at Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities and the defensive systems employed by Israeli and other forces in the region.

Kenneth McKenzie told Congress in 2023 that Iran had “over 3,000” ballistic missiles, according to a report this year from the Iran Watch website at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Ballistic missiles’ trajectories carry them outside or near the limits of Earth’s atmosphere, before the warhead payload separates from the rocket that carried it aloft and plunges back into the atmosphere and onto its target.

The Shahab-3 is the foundation for all Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles using a liquid propellant, according to Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES). The Missile Threat Project says the Shahab-3 entered service in 2003, can carry a warhead of 760 to 1,200 kilograms (1,675 to 2,645 pounds) and can be fired from mobile launchers as well as silos. Iran Watch says the newest variants of the Shahab-3, the Ghadr and Emad missiles, have accuracies of as close to 300 meters (almost 1,000 feet) of their intended targets.

(AP Photo/Baz Ratner) Baz Ratner/AP Related article With Hezbollah weakened, Israel’s challenge becomes knowing when to pull back Iranian media reported that Tehran used a new missile, the Fattah-1, in the attacks. Tehran describes the Fattah-1 as a “hypersonic” missile – meaning it travels at Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound (about 3,800 miles per hour, 6,100 kilometers per hour). But analysts point out that almost all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic speed during their flights, especially as they dive towards their targets. The term “hypersonic” is often used to refer to what are called hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles, highly advanced weapons that can maneuver at hypersonic speed inside Earth’s atmosphere. That makes such weapons extremely hard to shoot down. Fattah-1 is neither of those, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who wrote on the subject last year. Hinz says the Fattah-1 appears to have a warhead on a “maneuverable reentry vehicle,” which enables it to make adjustments to avoid missile defenses during a short portion of its dive to its target. Still, this ability would be an improvement on Iran’s earlier missiles, Hinz says. But analysts were skeptical that Iran would have used the new missile for the first time on Tuesday night. “It’s one of their newest ballistic missiles, and they have a lot to lose from using it,” said Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army. “Israel would get an idea of its capabilities just from being used. There’s also the chance it could fail to function, giving Israel an even greater idea of its capabilities. They get free propaganda and risk nothing by saying it was used.” Israel’s missile defenses Israel operates a range of systems to block attacks from everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them out of the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets. Much attention has been given to its highly effective Iron Dome system, which is used to combat incoming rockets and artillery weapons. But the Iron Dome is the bottom layer of Israel’s missile defense and is not the system that would have been used to combat the ballistic missiles launched on Tuesday night, according to the country’s Missile Defense Organization (IMDO). The next rung up the missile defense ladder is David’s Sling, which protects against short- and medium-range threats, according to the IMDO.

Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States. The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS. Some 180 ballistic missiles had been launched from Iran against Israel and intercepted in the sky across Israel on October 1, 2024. Matan Golan/SIPAPRE/AP The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the Arrow 2 an upgrade on the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role. Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets. CNN Related article Israel says Iran ‘will pay’ for launching a major missile attack against it During Tuesday night’s attack, the US military said it fired at least 12 anti-missile munitions against the incoming Iranian missiles. The US response came from the Navy guided-missile destroyers USS Cole and USS Bulkeley which were operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said. The Pentagon did not specify the interceptors used, but the US destroyers are equipped with the Aegis ballistic missile defense system, with interceptor missiles that can strike and destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their mid-course or terminal phases. Jordan’s air force also intercepted Iranian missiles on Tuesday night, a Jordanian official said, but no specifics were given. During an Iranian attack on Israel in April, Israeli and US warplanes shot down a large number of the incoming Iranian munitions. But Iran carried out that attack largely with slower-moving drones, which were much easier intercepts for the fighter jets than the ballistic warheads falling vertically on targets in Israel.

CNN teams on the ground in multiple locations in Israel observed dozens of missiles piercing through the skies as sirens blasted across the country. At least one person was killed and several  were injured during the attack, according to the Israeli military. The IDF’s international spokesman Nadav Shoshani told CNN’s Jake Tapper that one Palestinian was killed in Jericho as a result of the attacks. Israel has vowed to respond to the attack – sparking worries among its allies that the conflict in the Middle East could escalate further. Speaking hours after the assault, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies.” Video Ad Feedback Video shows Iranian missiles in the skies across Israel 01:16 - Source: CNN The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. It said it intercepted many of the missiles, although some landed on the ground in Israel and the occupied West Bank. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said later on Tuesday that the attack by Iran was “effectively defeated.” While the attack was over relatively quickly, it is clear that it has further raised the stakes in what is already an extremely tense moment. World leaders have long warned the conflict between Israel and Iran’s proxies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon could spiral into a wider regional war. All eyes will now be on how Israel responds. US President Joe Biden said the United States was “fully supportive” of Israel. But he said his administration was still discussing with Israel what kind of response would be appropriate. “We’re going to get all the data straight, we’re in constant contact with the Israeli government and our counterparts and that remains to be seen,” he said. Israel is already fighting on two fronts. It has been at war with Hamas in Gaza since the deadly October 7 terrorist attack by the group on southern Israel. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, with much of the strip reduced to rubble. And while Israel and Hezbollah have been trading cross-border fire for much of the past year, Iran launched the barrage on Tuesday just hours after Israel announced it launched a “limited and localized” ground operation in Lebanon. Sending Israeli troops into Lebanon would have been seen as a major escalation by Iran. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it targeted Israel in response to the killing of Nasrallah and others, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. After the barrage of missiles was launched, the Iranian mission to the United Nations said that Tehran carried out a response to “the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime.” The mission said on X that if Israel should “dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.” US warned about ‘imminent attack’ The White House warned earlier on Tuesday that Iran was poised to launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel soon, instantly ratcheting up fears of all-out war in the region. People in Tel Aviv and other cities have been told to stay near shelters or other protected areas and the atmosphere on the streets was noticeably tense. Video Ad Feedback National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan gives an update on Iran's attack 01:43 - Source: CNN In a statement released mid-morning, just hours before Tehran launched the attack, the White House said it had “indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel,” adding the United States was “actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack.” Israel assessed that Iran was likely to attack three Israeli air bases and an intelligence base located just north of Tel Aviv, a person briefed on the matter said before the attack. The IRGC said it targeted three Israeli military bases around Tel Aviv, according to the semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News. The intelligence base in Glilot was evacuated Tuesday afternoon, the person said, and the Israeli military has put contingency plans for the safety of personnel at those bases into effect. Two videos from the attack geolocated by CNN showed a number of Iranian missiles striking Nevatim air base in southern Israel based. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the videos, but did not immediately receive a response. Iran previously targeted the same base during a similar April 13 attack. Israel weighing its response US and Arab diplomats have been concerned about the scale of Israel’s response. One major concern on their mind is Israel possibly using a forthcoming Iranian strike to respond by striking inside Iran, potentially against its nuclear facilities. “There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that’s true of the entire Middle East,” Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said during his speech at the United Nations last week. The US was earlier prepared to do whatever it can to help Israel intercept anything Iran directed its way, similar to how the US offered its assistance in April , when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles towards Israel — the vast majority of which were successfully intercepted, a US official said. After the attack, Biden praised the role US played in thwarting Iran’s missiles, calling the attack “defeated and ineffective.” “This is testament to Israeli military capability, and US military. It’s also a testament to intensive planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack we expected,” he said. Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the attack and said she supported Biden’s decision to direct US military to help Israel shoot down Iranian missiles. Harris, who is the Democratic presidential nominee, said she was in the Situation Room earlier on Tuesday alongside Biden, and received updates from their national security team, adding that they “ensured that the protection of US personnel in the region is paramount.” Meanwhile, former president and the Republican nominee Donald Trump argued Iran launched the attack because “they don’t respect our country anymore,” and argued the US was diminished on the world stage because of Biden and Harris’ leadership.

Israel has described its initial ground incursion into southern Lebanon as such, although its key ally, the Biden administration, has already suggested that what may initially begin as small in scope could risk dragging on . It will take a remarkable amount of efficiency and discipline from the Israeli military and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to know when it is time to stop. Militaries are not particularly keen on pulling back, especially in large scale operations. If the incursion is easygoing, it could incentivize the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to push forward, sensing a weakened enemy against which swift progress can be made. If the going gets tough, the IDF can suggest the mission is more imperative than ever, and that they must push on. But, quite remarkably after two weeks of technological wizardry and ruthless, calculated attacks against Hezbollah – starting with the simultaneous explosion of communication devices and culminating in the killing of the militant group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah – the playing field may shift. The Israeli military are now walking into the ground trap that their adversary has been setting for them for well over a decade. IDF video Related video IDF releases footage showing underground tunnels in Lebanon They may discover that Hezbollah, its leadership decapitated , is so enfeebled that it is genuinely a less challenging task than imagined to mop up what remains of its ground troops after months of heavy airstrikes. But southern Lebanon was always going to be where the Iran-backed group held the home advantage. Its tunnel network provides them an endless maze for Israeli forces. And so, knowing when to stop is going to be key to this not becoming a quagmire for Israel. Almost every modern war that has dragged on for years began with the idea that it would all be over in a matter of weeks. While Israel’s operations over the past three weeks have been brutal, they have shown discipline and superior intelligence. But we’re now entering a new phase of this conflict in which key decisions must be made by an Israeli prime minister who was has shown himself to be maximalist in his military steps, and who is also desperately in need of a prolonged conflict to maintain his grip on power. It is going to take some extraordinarily swift dismantling of Hezbollah by the IDF for Netanyahu to be able to pull his forces out in a matter of days, and avoid months of not quite being sure how this all ends. Does Israel’s Lebanon operation increase the chances of wider war with Iran? The US warned Tuesday of a possible retaliatory ballistic missile strike by Iran on Israel, but that does not translate in to guaranteed damage, given the April interceptions of dozens of similar rockets, and Iran has clearly shown that - so far - it does not have the resources nor the willingness to lead a wider regional response against Israel. Smoke billows near a village in southern Lebanon after an Israeli airstrike, as seen from northern Israel on October 1, 2024. Jim Urquhart/Reuters But this is also an increased hazard for the civilians of Lebanon and some form of enduring peace, or at least sustainable calm, in the region. The less likely a wider conflagration is, the less leverage the US and Europe have over the Netanyahu administration. Time and again the West has managed to pull the region back from a brink they have said is perilously close. But now all the red lines to Israel’s north have literally seen troops march over them, and it really is not clear if Iran has any viable means of intervention at this time, outside of missile attacks that it has tried before to little avail. Yet the arc of retaliation is long, and Iran may exact retribution in ways not imminent yet still horrifically destabilizing – such as its very advanced nuclear program. But immediately they don’t seem to be able to deter Israel in any way. IDF Related article Israeli troops have launched a ground offensive in southern Lebanon. Here’s what we know And so, a fearful month begins, bedeviled by US electoral paralysis, in which any notions of the outgoing Biden administration being able to rein in Israel seem a little fanciful. The White House is, it seems, being told about huge escalations, like the assassination of Nasrallah last week, as they actually happen. If US Vice President Kamala Harris wins, her White House may decide to switch off the taps and slow Israel’s moves. And even Donald Trump, who seems to want all wars to stop, may have less of an appetite for a lengthy Israeli operation deep inside Lebanon that he ends up partially paying for. But on the hustings neither candidate wants to give the other the chance of labeling them weak on defending Israel. Netanyahu’s full intentions remain unclear. The closure of towns around Metula in northern Israel and shelling across the border has led to some speculation the IDF might be attempting a lightning race West towards the Lebanese city of Tyre, effectively cutting off all of Hezbollah in the country’s south. While this may be attractive strategically on a map, it is potentially a huge task with a lot of unkind geography in its way. But this is emblematic of the extraordinary jeopardy Israel now finds itself in. With a maximalist leader who had appeared to have shunned all diplomacy, it must now set a limited scope on an operation that it also hopes can permanently redefine the security threat to its north. It must find a way of inflicting significant damage on an adversary that has never been so weak, but also avoid getting caught in a trap. The Israeli prime minister has sanctioned actions over the past fortnight that have seemed tactically astute despite an apparent disregard for civilian casualties. But they are an outlier in the scope of the past year. The open sore of Gaza – a conflict without a perceivable end, or idea solution for coexistence and political accommodation for the Palestinians – shows how belligerent the current war cabinet can be when faced with larger strategic decisions. For Israel’s military endeavor to last weeks and not months, they will need extraordinary and rare success, discipline, and political wisdom."

Here’s what we know,"Israel has launched a ground operation across its northern border into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, opening a new and dangerous phase in almost a year of war.","Oct 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Helen Regan,Middle East,"CNN — Israel has launched a ground operation across its northern border into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, opening a new and dangerous phase in almost a year of war. The incursion, which Israel’s National Security Cabinet has called the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, marks the fourth time that Israeli soldiers have publicly entered Lebanese soil in nearly 50 years, and the first since Israel’s 34-day war in the country in 2006. Israeli troops laid the groundwork for what it called a “limited ground operation” in recent days, ramping up airstrikes that have killed hundreds of people, destroyed homes and displaced about 1 million people in Lebanon. The latest escalation comes after Israel killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on Friday and decimated the leadership of the most powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East. Here’s what we know. Extent of incursion unclear Israeli officials have characterized the incursion into southern Lebanon as limited in scope, saying there will be “no long-term occupation.” Officials have, however, declined to say how deep Israeli troops would venture into the country or how long the operation is expected to last. On Tuesday, the Israeli military called on residents in more than two dozen villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate approximately 30 miles into the country. An Israeli security official told reporters on condition of anonymity Tuesday morning that the operation does not amount to an invasion or incursion, describing it instead as “localized raids” that are “very limited in scope and in the area of operation.” The official said there were so far “no clashes” on the ground between the IDF and Hezbollah, but refused to comment on whether Israeli tanks have entered Lebanon and would not elaborate on how deep into Lebanese territory Israeli troops have advanced, saying they were focused on the border areas. “The amount of forces and the type of forces are more appropriate to something of a limited raid, and not, for example, things we’ve seen in Gaza with very, very large forces,” the official added. Hezbollah rejected the claim that Israeli forces had entered southern Lebanon, describing them as “lies,” according to a statement by spokesman Mohamed Afif on Tuesday. A source from the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said the Israeli military has staged some “sporadic raids” across the Lebanon-Israel border but its troops have not remained on Lebanese soil. The assessment that Israel has not yet launched a full-scale invasion was supported by two other high-level Lebanese security sources. A man stands on the rubble of buildings near the site of the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's southern suburbs, on September 29, 2024. Hassan Ammar/AP The Israeli military earlier said it was focused on removing “immediate threats” from Lebanese villages along the border, including Hezbollah’s ability to infiltrate northern Israel. Israeli soldiers, including paratroopers and commandos, as well as armored corps troops have been “preparing for limited, localized, targeted operations in southern Lebanon,” the Israeli military said , adding that soldiers have been training for weeks and had gained skills and operational experience in Gaza over many months. While the extent of Israel’s military plans inside Lebanon remain unclear, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become increasingly defiant of international calls for restraint and de-escalation, as well as widespread outrage over growing civilian casualties in Lebanon and Gaza. Previous military operations initially declared by Israel to be limited in their goals have proved to be anything but. Examples include Israel’s years-long occupation of southern Lebanon that began in 1982 with the stated aim of a brief and limited mission to destroy the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in the country. More recently, Israel’s military declared a “limited” operation in Rafah, southern Gaza that has left the city in ruins. What happened ahead of the incursion? Shortly before the incursion, Israel’s National Security Cabinet approved the “next phase” of its war with Hezbollah, according to Israeli media. In preparation, the Israeli military launched small raids and artillery fire across the Lebanon border, and sealed off several communities in northern Israel, limiting the movement of civilians there. The Lebanese army had also evacuated observation posts at the southern border and moved to barracks in the border villages, according to a Lebanese security source. The Army Command later denied reports it withdrew. CNN is unable to independently verify the Lebanese army’s movements. Meanwhile, Israel’s air force once again bombed the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut, predominantly Shia neighborhoods where Hezbollah has a stronghold. It follows Israeli airstrikes that hit inside Beirut’s city limits early Monday for the first time since the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel. The Lebanese health ministry said on Monday that at least 95 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in just 24 hours, and another 172 others injured.

Why are Israeli troops now in Lebanon? Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah have been engaged in a tit-for-tat escalation since the war in Gaza began following Hamas’ attack on Israel last October. Hezbollah first attacked Israel on October 8 and has said it will not stop striking Israel until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave, much of which has been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombs and fighting. In recent weeks, Israel has refocused its military objectives north with a new war aim to return displaced residents to their homes along the Lebanon border. About 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah’s rocket attacks. What’s unfolded is some of the fiercest fighting between the two longtime foes since the 2006 Lebanon war, which killed 1,100 in the country. Nearly 50 Israeli civilians and 121 Israeli soldiers were also killed. Last month, pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon in a coordinated Israeli attack that killed dozens of people and maimed thousands, including women and children. Israel has also stepped up a relentless bombing campaign across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure and leadership, but the strikes have also decimated homes and neighborhoods in densely populated areas. Massive airstrikes in southern Beirut have killed a string of Hezbollah leaders , as well as more than 1,000 people. The Iran question The latest developments raise questions about how a weakened Hezbollah will respond, and the extent to which its backer Iran could get involved, once more ratcheting up fears of a wider regional war . Hezbollah is part of an Iran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began.

Reuters Related article What might come next as Hezbollah reels from Nasrallah’s killing and Israel mulls a Lebanon ground incursion? In a fiery speech on Sunday, Netanyahu said one of Israel’s goals is “changing the balance of power in the region” and that “there is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach.” Killing Hezbollah leader Nasrallah and wiping out the group’s capabilities to launch a large-scale attack on Israel were “necessary” conditions to achieve that goal, he said. Israel has also ramped up attacks on multiple fronts against other Iran-backed militants, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen . But despite the recent Israeli strikes on its proxies, Iran has appeared wary of moving into direct conflict with its longtime enemy, even as their decades-long shadow war has been pushed further into the open. Many observers fear any direct Iranian retaliation could draw the United States further into the conflict. In a weekly news conference on Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani described Israel’s actions in Lebanon as “criminal,” and said that while the Islamic Republic is “not a warmonger… No measures and adventurism against Iran’s national security will go unanswered,” state-run IRNA reported. How has the US reacted? Attention has focused on how the once-mighty US is increasingly powerless to rein in its ally or to influence other major belligerents in a fast-worsening regional crisis . US officials told CNN they were informed by their Israeli counterparts that the incursion into Lebanon was expected to be limited in scope and duration. 30 September 2024, Lebanon, Qliyaa: Heavy smoke of Israeli air raids billows from the southern Lebanese border town Khiam.

President Joe Biden last week unveiled a 21-day ceasefire proposal , backed by other US allies, that was almost immediately rejected by Netanyahu – to the frustration of the White House. The US is a key provider of Israel’s weapons — it likely supplied the 2,000-pound bombs used to kill Hezbollah’s leader — but Biden and his advisers have continued to call for a diplomatic resolution. How has the world responded? Several states and UN bodies have warned of the impact on civilians in Lebanon and the risk of further regional instability. The European Union renewed its call for an immediate ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. In a statement on Monday, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell called for “the respect of international humanitarian law in all circumstances,” and said the “sovereignty of both Israel and Lebanon has to be guaranteed.” UNIFIL said in a statement that “any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity,” urging “all actors to step back from such escalatory acts which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed,” it added.” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot urged Israel on Monday “to refrain from any ground incursion” into Lebanon, and called on both sides to agree to a ceasefire. The United Arab Emirates expressed “deep concern” over the recent escalations, fearing its “impact on regional stability,” the state-run Emirates News Agency (WAM) reported, adding that the Gulf state “reaffirmed its unwavering position towards the unity of Lebanon, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity.” The UAE also directed an urgent $100 million relief package to the people of Lebanon. Jordan expressed “its rejection of the Israeli aggression” against Lebanon. Saudi Arabia said it “stresses the need to preserve Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” while Qatar expressed solidarity with Lebanon as well as “readiness to provide support to the people to confront the consequences of the Israeli aggression.” Turkey condemned Israel’s ground operation, calling it “a violation of sovereignty and an unlawful act of occupation,” according to the state-run Anadolu news agency . The United Nations’ agency for humanitarian emergencies (OCHA) warned of the devastating impact on civilians of the recent escalations in Lebanon. The UN agency urged the international community to “urgently promote de-escalation and ensure that all parties respect international humanitarian law, while prioritizing immediate humanitarian assistance to the affected people.” The UN’s World Food Programme has also launched an emergency project to scale up food assistance for up to 1 million people in need in Lebanon.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Monday launched the next stage of its onslaught against Hezbollah with what the Israel Defense Forces called a “limited ground operation” into Lebanon — despite weeks of requests from Washington for restraint and familiar (and spurned) calls for de-escalation. This came just hours after President Joe Biden said “we should have a ceasefire now,” when asked what he knew about Israeli special forces’ previous raids into southern Lebanon. “I’m comfortable with them stopping,” the president said. His comments only underscored the chasm between the US and Israeli governments on a day when Netanyahu told Iranians in a broadcast, “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.” The disconnect is widening as it coincides with the endgame of a cliffhanger US election. Biden’s room for maneuver is limited if he is to avoid exacerbating the domestic political impact of war in the Middle East — a factor Netanyahu, a consummate operator in US politics, surely understands. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, has largely stuck to the administration line — despite earlier comments that suggested she might take a slightly harder rhetorical stance toward Netanyahu while emphasizing the plight of Palestinian civilians. Video Ad Feedback Sen. Chris Van Hollen: 'Unacceptable' to transfer offensive weapons to Israel unless our values are met 13:55 - Source: CNN A humiliating pattern for the US on repeat The pattern of American impotency and Israeli defiance has played repeatedly since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, which prompted the Israeli pounding of Gaza and the more recent attempt to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu often acts first and consults the US later, even when his actions are certain to buckle American diplomatic efforts and compound fears the US will get dragged into a disastrous regional war. The US was not informed in advance, for example, about the Israeli airstrike Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah even though its global shockwaves were bound to be severe. This Israeli approach has often made the Biden administration appear a spectator rather than an active player in events, as should befit a superpower. Months of grueling shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Antony Blinken have mostly drawn a blank. And the US has incessantly pushed for a Gaza ceasefire that neither Netanyahu nor Hamas seems to want. This is not just a diplomatic embarrassment. Any time an American president is publicly spurned, there is a cost to their personal prestige and perceptions of US global power. And the likelihood is growing that Biden, who came to office professing to be a foreign policy expert, will leave the White House in a few months with a raging Middle East war set to stain his legacy. But the Israeli leader’s bet that, for all its reservations, the Biden administration will remain the guarantor of the Jewish state’s security has paid off. For instance, the US and its allies helped repel a massive Iranian missile and drone attack against Israel in April. The strikes followed an Israeli strike that the US didn’t know about in advance on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus that killed eight senior Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers. And so far, Biden, who has long prided himself on being one of the most pro-Israeli politicians in US history, has been loath to use the leverage he does have — for instance, permanently cutting off US military supplies for Israel, a step that would have huge political reverberations ahead of the election and leave him accused of deserting an ally fighting terror. Netanyahu often seems to be taking conscious advantage of Biden’s instincts, reasoning he’ll swallow any level of provocation. A deep symbolic irony encapsulates the duality of the US position in the conflict: a CNN analysis found that American-manufactured 2,000-pound bombs were likely used in the attack on Nasrallah, which threatens to ignite the regional conflagration that would be so ruinous to US interests and diplomatic goals. The price of US-Israeli tensions But the months of Israeli disregard for the administration’s political and strategic concerns have come at a stiff cost. Relations between Biden and Netanyahu are very tense. And growing antagonism often bursts into the open — most recently when US officials were furious the Israeli leader dissed an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire proposal by a groups of nations led by the US. Washington demanded the Israelis put out a statement to remedy the diplomatic embarrassment, CNN’s MJ Lee, Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hansler reported last week. Ret. Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on “CNN This Morning” that conversations between Israeli and US officials ahead of the expected Israeli move into southern Lebanon were “pretty tense … especially at the upper levels.” He added: “The key thing to keep in mind is that Israel has basically deliberately kept the US uninformed when it came to the details of their operations.” On the one side, Leighton said, “The US is trying to restrain the Israelis; they’re trying to limit the scope of military action that the Israelis are conducting. The Israelis are looking at this from a military standpoint right now, and they’re seeing the capability and the possibility of going and basically eliminating Hezbollah as a threat to northern Israel and potentially as a threat at all.” Why has the US-Israeli split widened? The last year’s events have forced the United States and Israel into a situation in which the critical national interests of each state as perceived by its elected leaders are in direct conflict. The Netanyahu government interpreted the October 7 attacks as a graphic manifestation of an existential threat to the state of Israel and Jews in the Middle East. With that mindset, even intense ill feeling with the White House can be tolerated. And the sense that Israel is waging a battle for its survival makes it easier for leaders to justify to themselves the massive Palestinian civilian casualties from Israeli actions against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, even if the rest of the world sees the carnage as heinously disproportionate. The United States might warn against the threat of a regional war, but Israel believes it’s been embroiled in such a conflict for years against proxy groups taking direction or inspiration from its enemies in Iran’s clerical leadership. But events look different through Washington’s wider strategic and historic lens amid worries that Israel’s short-term victories are not sustainable and may simply be laying the predicate for decades more insecurity and warfare. America’s national interests do not just lie in the preservation of Israel. The White House is desperate to avoid being sucked into another bitter conflict in the Middle East, given the two decades it took to extract American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Outposts of US soldiers still in the region, including in Syria and Iraq, also remain highly vulnerable to attacks by Iranian proxies as the deaths of three US service personnel in a drone attack on Jordan in January showed. The global and political implications of the year of rage in the region are also huge. For instance, months of attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have seen US and allied naval forces often under fire and intercepting missiles from Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Cascading economic impacts from slowed supply chains, as shipping lines send cargo on a longer route around Africa, are also considerable. The clashes are unlikely to end while Israel blasts Gaza and Lebanon. Israeli thinks it’s winning, fueling its reluctance to stop There are also contrasting military perceptions between Israel and the US. Israel has wiped out many of its most dangerous enemies in stunning intelligence and military actions. In addition to the elimination of Nasrallah, who built Hezbollah into a grave threat to Israel in 30 years, Hamas has also accused Israel of killing Ismail Haniyeh, one of its top leaders, in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. It has also killed other senior members of the two groups in strikes in Syria, Lebanon, Iran and in Gaza. Israeli-detonated attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies injured or killed thousands of Hezbollah operatives. So why would Netanyahu not press ahead with the greatest Israeli strategic success in decades whatever Biden says? But Washington has much wider concerns. They include the horrendous civilian casualties and humanitarian disasters in Gaza and Lebanon, a state that has enjoyed a few decades of comparative stability after a murderous civil war, which raged between 1975 and 1990, and caused considerable US bloodshed. The deaths of thousands of civilians is not just a tragedy in itself, it creates severe pressure on the US from its allies and tarnishes America’s image by association. The longer the war goes on, the greater the threat that conflicts intensifying across the region could all join into one perilous multi-front war and that a direct conflict could break out between the US and its arch enemy Iran. A regional war would have disastrous economic consequences and could further deflect from the US goal of mobilizing for its new superpower showdown with China. Venomous politics are changing long-held truths about the US-Israel relationship There are also intractable political factors pulling the governments apart. For most of Israel’s existence, it would have been politically and strategically ruinous for a prime minister to show such contempt for a US president. But Netanyahu’s own march to the far right and the reliance of his coalition on ultra-orthodox parties means that his priority is appeasing the most extreme domestic elements to stay in power. The weakness of centrist and left-wing parties in Israel means a dearth of alternative leaders like late prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin or Shimon Peres, who were ideologically and temperamentally in tune with US presidents. The rise of incendiary and radical leaders like Nasrallah and Hamas officials also means there are no partners on the other side open to traditional US peacemaking. Even legendary US secretary of state and peace-shuttler James Baker would have struggled with this regional cast of characters. American calls for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict may ultimately reflect the only possible route to an ending of a generationslong confrontation — but they also seem utterly divorced from the realities of the blood-soaked Middle East in 2024. And many observers in Washington have long suspected that Netanyahu has a strong personal interest in perpetually waging war to redeem his own failure to stop the October 7 attacks and to keep postponing his legal reckoning as he faces serious criminal charges. America’s own venomous political reality is also eroding US power in the Middle East. Support for Israel was once an unshakable principle that united Republicans and Democrats. But Netanyahu’s meddling in US politics for years — over the Iranian nuclear issue, for instance — has alienated many Democrats and their party’s move to the left has further tempered backing for Israel. Ex-President Donald Trump indulged and encouraged the most radical of Netanyahu’s policies — further politicizing the US-Israel relationship. And pro-Trump Republicans are goading him to go further — at least partly to weaken Biden and his chosen successor, Harris. Biden and Harris are in a dicey political spot a month before the election. Biden’s failure to rein in Israel in Gaza and now Lebanon – and the consequential human carnage – has split the Democratic Party and threatens to drive down turnout among progressives and Arab American voters, especially in swing states like Michigan. But any move to punish Israel could damage Harris among moderate and swing state voters, who are being barraged with negative Trump ads claiming she and Biden are weak and leading the United States into World War III. This is just one of many reasons why Netanyahu is incentivized to expand his war no matter how powerless it makes America look. This story has been updated with additional developments."

Joint defenses are being prepared to ward off an attack with changes in US military posture, the official added. The Biden administration spearheaded a multi-national defense of Israel in mid-April when Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel in response to the Israeli bombing of senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers in Syria. The US official declined to say what kind of attack is expected from Iran or specify the moves the US military is making. Fears of a broader regional war in the Middle East have spiked in recent weeks as Israel intensifies its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Iran-backed group vows to continue its fight, even as a growing number of its top commander have been killed. The Pentagon said in a statement Sunday night that “should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people.” Defense Department Spokesman Gen. Patrick Ryder noted “a significant amount of capability in the region,” including the USS Abrahm Lincoln Carrier Strike Group. Nasrallah was killed in a massive Israeli bombing in southern Beirut on Friday. He led the most powerful of Iran’s Middle East proxies for decades and his death is a potentially crippling setback for Hezbollah as well as a major blow to Iran’s control in the region. Biden administration officials are also defending their decision to announce the “breakthrough” of a ceasefire proposal last week between Israel and Hezbollah that quickly turned into an embarrassment for the administration when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear Israeli forces would instead continue to pound the Lebanese militant group. US officials argue that Israel changed its mind Wednesday night after the proposal – which was signed onto by 11 other allies - was announced. Israel decided they had an opportunity to target Nasrallah, a US official said. The US official told CNN the US-led statement issued Wednesday had been greenlit by Israel after working on it together for several days. On a hastily-arranged call that night, senior Biden administration officials told reporters with confidence: “the ceasefire will be for 21 days” across the Lebanon-Israel border. They believed it would go into effect quickly so that diplomatic efforts could take over to lead to a more permanent truce. But hours later Netanyahu said Israel “will continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might.” Israeli officials tried to explain what happened as an “honest misunderstanding.” They say they thought what the US, France and other countries were proposing “was the start of a process that could ultimately lead to a ceasefire.” But “Americans thought it was the end of the process and the start of a ceasefire,” a senior Israeli official told CNN. What gave American officials confidence was that they had been dealing directly with one of Netanyahu’s closest aides, Ron Dermer. He and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had launched the discussions two days prior, on Monday. The US official claimed on Sunday that the administration retreated from pushing last week’s ceasefire plan once they learned Israel may try to take out Nasrallah. But the White House insists the efforts to reach a diplomatic solution in order to get tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli civilians back to their homes are still alive. “I think what we would agree on is that there needs to be an effort to de-escalate here,” the White House’s national security spokesman John Kirby told CNN on Sunday. “We believe and continue to believe that an all-out war with Hezbollah, certainly with Iran, is not the way to do that. If you want to get those folks back home safely and sustainably, we believe that a diplomatic path is the right path,” he added."

Israel’s leader sees an opportunity opening up for a fundamental reconfiguration of power in Middle East and he may assume that Hezbollah are mortally wounded. Total victory, however, is elusive, and those who get what they wish for often live to regret it. Since Sept 17, Israel has dealt the Iran-backed militant group one body blow after another in Lebanon — first the pager and walkie talkie blasts, then a massive air strike on southern Beirut which killed senior commander Ibrahim Aqil (along with at least two dozen civilians), followed three days later by the start of a brutal bombing campaign. By Friday evening – when Nasrallah was killed in a bombing that flattened multiple buildings – Hizballah’s senior leadership had been almost totally eliminated.

Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images Related live-story Hezbollah leader’s killing escalates war with Israel Yet recent history offers only bitter lessons for Israeli leaders — and others — who entertain grand ambitions for tectonic changes in Lebanon, and in the Middle East in general. In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the goal of crushing the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Beyond that, it hoped to establish a malleable Christian-dominated government in Beirut and to drive Syrian forces out of the country. It failed at all three. Yes, Palestinian armed groups in Lebanon were compelled to leave the country under an American-brokered deal that sent them into exile in Tunisia, Yemen and elsewhere. But the goal of quashing Palestinian national aspirations along with the PLO failed. Five years later, the First Palestinian Intifada, or uprising,broke out in Gaza and spread to the West Bank. Today the Palestinians are as adamant and restive as they’ve ever been in their rejection of Israeli occupation. Two Lebanese women walk in a West Beirut street devastated by Israeli shelling during the ""Operation Peace for Galilee"" on July 24, 1982. Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images Israel’s main ally in Lebanon at the time of the invasion was Bashir Al-Gemayel, a Maronite Christian militia leader who was elected by parliament, but before he took office was assassinated in a massive blast in east Beirut. His brother, Amin, replaced him, and under his leadership and with active American involvement and encouragement in May 1983 Lebanon and Israel signed an agreement for the establishment of normal bilateral relations. In the face of intense opposition, the government fell the following February and soon the agreement was abrogated. The US, which had deployed troops to Beirut after the September 1982 Sabra-Shatila massacres, pulled out after its embassy was twice bombed, along with the US marines and French army barracks in October 1983. The Lebanese civil war re-erupted and raged on more than six years. Syrian forces, which had entered Lebanon in 1976 as a “deterrence force” under an Arab League mandate, didn’t leave until 2005 after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the 1982 Israeli invasion was the birth of Hezbollah, which went on to wage a relentless guerrilla war that compelled Israel to unilaterally withdraw from south Lebanon – significantly the first and only time an Arab military force successfully pushed Israel to retreat from Arab land. This new group, with Iran’s help, proved to be far more lethal and effective than the Palestinian militants Israel had successfully driven out. Hezbollah went on to fight Israel to a standstill in the 2006 war, and in the following years grew only stronger, with significant Iranian help.

Clipped From Video video Related video Kirby: ‘I don’t think anybody’s mourning’ Nasrallah but ‘there needs to be an effort to de-escalate’ Beyond Lebanon and Israel, there is the example of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, a lesson in the wages of unfettered hubris. As the Iraqi army crumbled and US troops raced to Baghdad, the George W. Bush administration entertained fantasies that the fall of Saddam Hussein would lead to the toppling of regimes in Tehran and Damascus, and ignite a flowering of liberal democracies across the region. Instead the US occupation of Iraq descended into a blood bath of sectarian violence, in which the US paid dearly in blood and treasure, the people of Iraq even more. The killing of Saddam Hussain allowed Iran to spread its influence to the very heart of the political establishment in Baghdad. Al-Qaeda, shattered by the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, was reborn in Iraq’s Sunni triangle, and eventually morphed into the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. As I write this, I see smoke rising from across Beirut’s battered southern suburbs and recall the words of then-US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who, during the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war, said all the bloodshed and destruction we were witnessing then were “the birth pangs of the new Middle East.” Beware of those who promise a new dawn, the birth of a new Middle East, a new balance of power in the region. Lebanon is a microcosm of all that can go wrong. It’s the land of unintended consequences."

The Iran-backed group’s long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed on Friday in a massive bombardment that was the first of the nearly 48 hours of incessant airstrikes. Scores of top commanders and officials were killed alongside him as well as in the attacks that followed. Many civilians are also believed to have been killed. More than 24 hours after Nasrallah’s body was recovered from the deep pit left behind by the heavy bombs that killed him, a funeral for the militant leader is yet to be scheduled – highly unusual in Islamic tradition where the dead receive a quick burial. The group is also yet to appoint a new secretary general, defying long-held expectations that the group would rapidly unfurl a succession plan after Nasrallah’s death.

History has a warning This has added to a pervading sense that Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group which for decades dominated the country’s politics, had swiftly become a ghost organization. In one fell swoop, Israel seemed to remove not just the group’s leadership, but perhaps also all its contingency plans , further evidence of the profound scope of Israel’s infiltration of the group’s ranks. “It’s fabricated. There’s no proof that he’s dead,” said Hassan, a Hezbollah supporter leaning on a parked moped, his eyes glassy with tears. “He’s going to appear soon and he’s going to surprise us.” Abu Mohamad, a middle-aged Shia man displaced from southern Lebanon to a sidewalk in central Beirut, said, “It doesn’t matter if he’s alive or dead, because a leader like Nasrallah lives in us always,” he said. “We will continue on the path he set, and we will return to our homes.” Nasrallah inspired strong feelings in the Lebanese – revered and reviled in equal measure.

Umm Mohammed and her five-year-old son escaped the Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon, displaced to a tarpaulin on a seaside boardwalk. Jomana Karadsheh/CNN Lebanese authorities believe just under 1,100 people have been killed and around 1 million have been displaced by Israel’s intensified bombardment campaign since it began last Monday. A response, Israel says, to the rocket attacks from Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas attacked on October 7, and which have forced 60,000 people from their homes in northern Israel. Lebanon’s border villages have also been emptied of around 100,000 villagers by Israeli attacks in turn. Still, Hezbollah has vowed to keep up its border rocket fire until the end of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Now, large parts of the densely populated southern suburbs have been devastated. The displaced have taken to the relatively affluent, and still untouched, western parts of the capital where they have camped out on sidewalks, parks, schools, churches and mosques.

Many of the country’s displaced have lost loved ones but can barely find the time to grieve as they scramble for shelter and food. Those not yet personally impacted by the bombardment must contend with the unknown territory into which the death of Nasrallah and his cadre of senior leaders has thrust the country. “The assassination of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah came to open a wound in the heart of the Lebanese,” the Patriarch of the Maronite Church, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi said at Sunday Mass. Rahi has long been one of Hezbollah’s most prominent critics. In January he implicitly criticized Hezbollah for dragging the south of Lebanon into conflict with its cross-border rocket and drone attacks on Israel. Hezbollah has repeatedly vowed not to cease fire on its southern border until the end of Israel’s ongoing offensive in Gaza. Rahi had also condemned “the culture of death that has brought nothing but imaginary victories and shameful defeats to our country.” Nasrallah’s main Sunni foes have also condemned the assassination. “The assassination of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has brought Lebanon and the region to a new phase of violence. It was a cowardly act that we condemn in every way,” Lebanon’s former Prime Minister Saad Hariri said in a post on X. “We disagreed a lot with the late (Nasrallah) and with his party, and we met infrequently. However Lebanon serves as a tent for all, and in these extremely challenging times, our unity and our solidarity remains foundational,” Hariri continued. Lebanon’s complex confessional power-sharing structure has mean that divisions frequently spark internal strife, political paralysis and even violence. But Israel, technically classified in Lebanon as an “enemy state,” has historically brought the fragmented country together, albeit temporarily. Meanwhile, civilians wandering the streets for safety have borne the cost of this new war.

A visual guide,Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Here’s a look at their military arsenal and how it compares to Israel.,"Sep 29, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Lou Robinson,Middle East,"CNN — Hezbollah is believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world. Backed by Iran and based in the eastern Mediterranean country of Lebanon, the Shiite Islamist group has been engaged in confrontations with Israeli forces on Lebanon’s southern border since October 8. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks. Cross-border hostilities have since escalated, culminating in the death of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut. The cross-border conflict and recent developments have raised the specter of a regional conflagration and amplified intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. Though no match for Israel’s military might, Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated arsenal has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel. Israel would also have to contend with Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The group is part of an Iran-led axis of militants spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq. Some of these groups have increased coordination significantly since October, when Israel launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked the country. This axis is known in Israel as the “ring of fire.” For nearly a year, Hezbollah’s partners in the region have been engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies. Yemen’s Houthis have sporadically fired at vessels in the Red Sea, an artery of global trade, as well as on Israel. Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of hardline Shiite factions, has also launched attacks on US positions in that country. The axis has conditioned the cessation of those hostilities on a ceasefire in Gaza, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in Gaza, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader. In September, Israel stepped up its direct confrontation with Hezbollah. In back-to-back attacks , hundreds of Hezbollah’s pagers and walkie-talkies exploded, killing at least 37 people and injuring thousands, before an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander. In response, Hezbollah has vowed “a battle without limits.” Following the twin communications attacks, Hezbollah launched what it said was a ballistic missile at Israel, targeting the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad. It is believed to be the first ballistic missile to be launched by militant group toward Israel. The strike, which was intercepted, reached near the bustling city of Tel Aviv. Hezbollah’s fighting force emerged from the rubble of Israel’s 1982 invasion of Beirut. At the time, it was a rag-tag group of Islamist fighters supported by Iran’s fledgling Islamic Republic. This was followed by a meteoric rise in the group’s military and political might. In 2000, its guerrilla fighters forced Israeli forces to withdraw from south Lebanon, ending a more-than-20-year occupation. In 2006, it survived a 34-day war with Israel that wreaked havoc on Lebanon. During Syria’s uprising-turned-civil war in the 2010s, it fought on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as he brutally quashed armed opposition forces and inflicted a huge civilian death toll. As it fought in the trenches of that nearly decade-long war, Hezbollah became seasoned in urban warfare and solidified its alliances with other Iran-backed groups fighting in Syria. It also cleared a vital supply route for weapons between Iran and Lebanon, via its partners in Iraq and Syria, further bolstering its arsenal. Hezbollah’s military capabilities have notably grown since its last war with Israel in 2006. Military analysts estimate Hezbollah to have between 30,000 and 50,000 troops, but earlier this year its leader Nasrallah claimed it has more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles. Experts say the group’s biggest military asset is the long-range ballistic missile, of which it is estimated to have thousands, including 1,500 precision missiles with ranges of 250–300 kilometers (155–186 miles). Throughout its decades-long conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has been engaged in asymmetric warfare. It has sought to grow its political and military might, while seeking to establish deterrence despite Israel’s military superiority. But Hezbollah threads the needle carefully. Provoking Israel’s full firepower could significantly degrade the group’s capabilities, setting it back years – if not decades – and destroying large parts of Lebanon, which has buckled under the weight of its years-long financial crisis. The group has already lost more than around 500 fighters, including commanders, in border confrontations with Israel since October, according to Hezbollah statements and a CNN tally. On the Lebanese side of the border, over 94,000 people have been displaced. The impact on Israel has also been considerable, with more than 62,000 people displaced from its northern border area, and scores killed, including soldiers and civilians. As the confrontations at the border continue, Hezbollah has sought, with some success, to undermine Israel’s vaunted missile defense system known as the Iron Dome. It has tried to do so by attacking its platforms and overwhelming it with swarms of drones and short-range missiles in order to open a path for other projectiles to reach deeper into Israeli territory. The full extent of Hezbollah’s arsenal is not clear. In response to Israel’s twin wireless device attacks, Hezbollah fired a barrage of missiles across the border into northern Israel, and said it hit an air base with Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles – a longer-range weapon not known to have been used so far in nearly a year of conflict. Hezbollah’s chances of survival in an all-out war with Israel is hinged on whether or not it can outsmart these systems which have in recent months intercepted thousands of airborne weapons from Iran, Gaza and Lebanon.

Nasrallah’s killing, in a huge set of Israeli airstrikes on his underground headquarters in Beirut on Friday, marks a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group, which has been firing on Israel since the start of its war against Hamas in Gaza. It is also the latest in a string of major blows to Hezbollah, which has now lost multiple commanders and was already reeling after pagers and walkie-talkies owned by its members exploded earlier this month, killing dozens and maiming thousands. Israel has warned that a “new era” of war was beginning with its “center of gravity” moving north, in a reference to the Lebanon border. One of its stated war aims is to return tens of thousands of its own civilians displaced by cross-border fighting. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Lebanon due to the recent fighting, while more than a thousand have been killed since the airstrikes escalated last week, according to Lebanese government officials. Israel has raised the possibility of a ground incursion into Lebanon, which, if undertaken, would be the fourth Israeli invasion of the country in the past 50 years. Hezbollah has vowed that it will “continue its fight to confront the enemy,” while Iran, which backs the group as part of its network of regional proxies, has given an assurance of its solidarity . Here’s what we know so far and where things might go next. Escalating conflict Israel has pounded what it says are Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese capital of Beirut and elsewhere in the country on Friday and Saturday, including the attack on the capital’s southern suburbs that killed Nasrallah. Some of the strikes have come in densely populated areas, flattening residential buildings. Israel has said Hezbollah stores weapons in civilian buildings, which the group denies, and accuses Hezbollah of using residents as “human shields.” Lebanese civilians say they cannot heed warnings from Israel’s military to avoid places where Hezbollah is operating, because the group is highly secretive. The warnings also often come just minutes before a building is struck. Residents from Beirut’s southern suburbs have been fleeing to escape Israeli bombardment, with many seen sleeping in public places with no space left in makeshift shelters.

Carl Court/Getty Images The latest attacks come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off a ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States and France that called for a 21-day pause in fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border. The White House has said it had “no knowledge of or participation in” Israel’s Friday attack on Beirut, with US President Joe Biden describing Nasrallah’s death as a “measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, while calling for de-escalation in conflicts across the Middle East. The US sees the possibility of a limited ground incursion into Lebanon as Israel moves forces to its northern border, CNN reported earlier, citing a senior administration official and a US official. But the officials stressed that Israel does not appear to have made a decision on whether to carry out a ground incursion. Earlier Saturday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner said the military was preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion, but it was only one option being considered. What will Hezbollah – or Iran – do? In the wake of Nasrallah’s killing – and the attack on pagers and walkie-talkies – Hezbollah’s remaining leaders are likely to be assessing how to meet, communicate and respond. Some of the factors that will impact that response – such as the extent to which Israeli strikes have reduced the group’s munitions – remain unknown. But analysts say the setbacks faced by the group are unlikely to leave it completely weakened. “Hezbollah has taken the biggest blow to its military infrastructure since its inception,” said Hanin Ghaddar , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and author of “Hezbollahland.” The group, however, still retains skilled commanders, as well as many of its most powerful assets – including precision-guided missiles and long-range missiles that could inflict significant damage to Israel’s military and civilian infrastructure, said Ghaddar. So far, there has not been a major barrage of rockets from Hezbollah that has caused significant, known damage to Israeli targets. And even in the wake of Nasrallah’s killing the group has yet to launch a major retaliation at the level that could see Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system overwhelmed and its power grid affected.

Baz Ratner/AP But the latest development raises the potential for a shift. Hezbollah will almost certainly respond, according to Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region, who told CNN: “The response is likely to be big enough that the odds it will prompt a full-scale war will skyrocket.” Another key question is the extent to which Iran could get involved. The state has appeared wary of moving into direct conflict with Israel, even as their long-standing shadow war has been pushed further into the open in recent months – and observers say direct Iranian retaliation could also draw the US further into the conflict. A senior US official said the US believes Iran will intervene in the conflict if they judge that they are about to “lose” Hezbollah. The combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah had already taken hundreds of fighters off the battlefield, according to that official and another person familiar with the intelligence. Iran’s embassy in Lebanon in a social media post Friday called Nasrallah’s killing a “serious escalation that changes the rules of the game,” and said its perpetrator “will be punished and disciplined appropriately.” The Iranian envoy to the United Nations on Saturday also requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council to “condemn Israel’s actions in the strongest possible terms.” But the space for diplomacy seems limited, especially as months of work on a ceasefire deal for the war in Gaza have seen little lasting progress. Pointing to the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Hezbollah, and Israel and Iran, former US State Department Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN: “None of these wars of attrition are going to end any time soon… there are no transformative, diplomatic Hollywood endings.” “At best, it’s a question of deterrence, management and maybe, if Hezbollah, the Israelis and the Iranians are open to it… agreements that will contain conflict,” he said.

His death marks a major moment in recent Middle East history, but the long-term consequences are uncertain. It raises a key question: Do “decapitation strikes” killing the leaders of terrorist groups cripple them? The short answer is not really. Israel should know from its own history that such strikes don’t always succeed in crippling a militant group. In 2008, Israel killed Hezbollah’s military leader , Imad Mughniyeh, in Damascus, Syria, yet the group only gathered strength in the years that followed. Four years earlier, Israel killed a founder of Hamas , Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in an airstrike. Yet, the group did not collapse, and almost two decades later it still carried out the October 7 attacks in Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis in a single day. More recently, in July, Israel said it killed one of the October 7 masterminds, Mohammed Deif , a key Hamas military commander, yet the militant group fights on in Gaza. The US has its own history of killing terrorist leaders in the hope that it will cripple its foes. When Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a US bombing raid in 2006, it was treated as a major breakthrough because al Qaeda in Iraq was significantly contributing to the civil war that was then tearing the country apart. Yet eight years later, al Qaeda in Iraq eventually morphed into ISIS , which took over territory the size of Portugal and presided over a population of some eight million people in Iraq and Syria. ISIS also carried out devastating terrorist attacks in the West, for instance, in Paris in 2015 that killed 130 people. What actually ended ISIS’s geographical “caliphate” was not a strike on its leadership but a ground campaign against the terrorist army from 2014 to 2019 waged by the Iraqi military and Syrian Kurdish forces backed by thousands of US troops and significant American airpower. ISIS’s base, the second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, was largely destroyed during this war. In May 2016, then-President Barack Obama authorized a drone strike in Pakistan that killed the overall leader of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour. Yet, today, the Taliban control all of Afghanistan. Then-President Donald Trump ordered a strike in Baghdad, Iraq, in early January 2020 that killed Qasem Soleimani , the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Quds Force who was crucial to Iran’s relationships with its proxy forces in the region such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen and Shia militias in Iraq. After Soleimani was killed, Trump said, “Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.” Yet, his death had no lasting impact on Iran’s regional power and ambitions, and Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis in Yemen have continued their attacks on Israeli targets and Shia militias continued their attacks on American targets in Iraq. The United States has designated the Taliban, the Houthis, Hamas, ISIS and Hezbollah as terrorist groups. What can disable a terrorist group? What can cripple a terrorist group is a sustained campaign to take out as many of its leaders and middle managers as possible. A CIA drone campaign that was ramped up in 2008 in Pakistan’s tribal regions bordering Afghanistan killed many of al Qaeda’s leaders, according to New America , a research institution (where I am a vice president). Documents recovered by the US Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011 show that al Qaeda’s leader regularly wrote to his followers living in the country’s tribal regions, urging them to move around only on cloudy days when the drones were less effective. As a result, bin Laden was planning to pull all his followers out of the tribal region and resettle them in other parts of Pakistan. Bin Laden’s death certainly significantly contributed to undercutting al Qaeda’s appeal to terrorists and its abilities to carry out attacks since it was bin Laden who had founded the group, had directed its most lethal operations, and members of the group had sworn a personal oath of allegiance to him. Bin Laden’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, didn’t have the charisma or the organizational skills to resuscitate al Qaeda, and Zawahiri himself was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan two years ago. The UN estimates there are about four hundred members of al Qaeda living in Afghanistan today. While al Qaeda is a relatively small terrorist group, Hezbollah has been in existence for four decades and is backed by Iran, which is a key player in the region and has an army of some 30,000 soldiers armed with an extensive arsenal , including some 150,000 rockets and missiles. The killing of Nasrallah is a key prize for Israel as part of its larger wave of attacks on Hezbollah that intensified earlier this month with its covert action exploding thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies followed by massive airstrikes that have taken out infrastructure and other senior leaders. But it’s too early to write the militant group off, though it’s clearly in disarray. History suggests it will reorganize and appoint other leaders to continue its long fight against Israel."

Nasrallah, who had led the powerful group for more than 30 years and was a hugely influential figure in the region, died when Israeli fighter jets struck in an area of the capital’s southern suburbs known as Dahiyeh. The killing of Nasrallah marks a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which has intensified in recent weeks, prompting fears that it could spill over into a regional war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Nasrallah had been operating from the headquarters and “advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel.” Hezbollah described Nasrallah as a “sacred martyr” and vowed to continue its fight against Israel. He was among several Hezbollah fighters – and a senior Iranian commander – killed in the strike on Friday. “The leadership of Hezbollah pledges to the most supreme, sacred, and dearest martyr in our journey, filled with sacrifices and martyrs, that it will continue its fight to confront the enemy, in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defense of Lebanon and its steadfast and honorable people,” the group said in a statement. The Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar TV channel switched to Quranic recitations – an Islamic gesture declaring mourning. Hamas issued a statement mourning Nasrallah, as did other regional allies . In Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati declared three days of mourning. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared five days of national mourning and warned that Israel faces “crushing blows” to come. The powerful Iraqi cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr also announced three days of mourning in Iraq, referring to Nasrallah as a “companion in the path of resistance.” A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. Hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on September 17, killing at least nine people and wounding around 2,800 in blasts the Iran-backed militant group blamed on Israel. AFP/Getty Images Related article Israel concealed explosives inside batteries of pagers sold to Hezbollah, Lebanese officials say Nasrallah turned Hezbollah into the most robustly armed non-state group in the region – commanding a dedicated following across Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. It is the most dominant political force in crisis-ridden Lebanon. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization . Fears of an all-out war peaked earlier this month, after Israel unleashed a wave of lethal explosions of communications devices, targeting Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. Some of those killed were civilian bystanders. Then on Monday , Israel launched an intensive aerial campaign in southern and eastern Lebanon, in what was the deadliest day for the country in nearly two decades . Hezbollah has fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel in response to the attacks. Israeli bombs in Lebanon have since killed at least 700 people, and thousands more have been injured, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday. Nearly 120,000 others have been displaced, according to OCHA, in a country where both Lebanese and refugees from other countries were already facing sharp poverty, economic instability and limited access to healthcare. Estimates in Lebanon suggest that number could be much higher. An Israeli military official said they did not yet know how many civilians were killed in Israel’s strike on southern Beirut that killed Nasrallah. A man rides his motorbike through a neighborhood levelled by Israeli strikes, in the Hadath district, of Beirut's southern suburbs, on Saturday. AFP/Getty Images Questions have swirled over how the Iran-backed group will respond to Israel’s persistent bombing campaign, and now the killing of its leader. Hezbollah’s response has so far been relatively contained. Israeli officials cited two key reasons for this: Nearly all of Hezbollah’s senior commanders have been killed, leaving its command-and-control structure in disarray, and Israeli airstrikes have debilitated much of the operational infrastructure Hezbollah would use to carry out significant retaliation. But one Israeli official acknowledged that Israel knows it has not taken out Hezbollah’s entire capabilities and that its senior commanders are replaceable. How Hezbollah regroups and what direction it receives from Iran also remain to be seen . A senior member of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC), was also killed in the Israeli attack, according to Iranian state media. Abbas Nilforoshan, who served as a military adviser during the Syrian civil war, was likely meeting Nasrallah when Israel struck. The commander was sanctioned by the US treasury for his role in suppressing protests during the 2022 Iranian demonstration after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in custody of Iran’s morality police. Israel expands war on multiple fronts For most of the past year, Israel and Hezbollah have traded skirmishes at the border, following Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks into southern Israel. Hamas killed 1,200 in the attacks and abducted more than 250 others, according to Israeli authorities. Hezbollah says it has been firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, and Palestinians trying to survive Israeli attacks in Gaza , which have killed 41,586 people and injured another 96,210, according to the Ministry of Health there. Around 60,000 Israeli civilians have been forced from their homes by Hezbollah rocket fire that began on October 8. The Lebanese militant group is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the region – spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq – that says it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza rages on.

Western leaders have warned of devastating consequences, as Israel intensifies attacks in the region. Hussein Malla/AP As the Israeli military intensifies its war on multiple fronts in the region, Western allies have warned of catastrophic consequences in Lebanon – which they say could even exceed the irrevocable destruction and human devastation in Gaza. The strike that killed Nasrallah was also a clear signal that Israel was not close to accepting a ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, backed by the US , according to Mick Mulroy, a former top Middle East official at the Defense Department. Hezbollah is also now unlikely to be interested in the negotiations. On Saturday, US President Joe Biden called Nasrallah’s killing a “measure of justice for his many victims,” including Americans, but called for de-escalation. The US “fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups,” Biden said in a statement. “Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means,” he added. Meanwhile, Israeli forces renewed their attacks in the densely populated Dahiyeh neighborhood into Saturday. Israeli strikes razed buildings to rubble. At least 33 people were killed and 195 others injured in Saturday’s attacks, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Since Monday, Israel’s attacks in Lebanon have left around one million people displaced, according to Nasser Yassin, the minister in charge of Lebanon’s crisis management center. A CNN team on the ground reported large flashes and thuds of impacting Israeli missiles echoed across the capital Saturday. Officials announced that hospitals in Dahiyeh would be evacuated “due to developments in the aggression.” The IDF said it was targeting what it alleges are buildings used by Hezbollah as command centers, weapons productions and storage sites. Hezbollah has denied that its weapons are being stored in civilian buildings targeted by Israeli strikes. The IDF said a senior Hezbollah intelligence leader, Hassan Khalil Yassin, was killed in a Saturday airstrike in the Dahiyeh area. The IDF said Yassin worked with Hezbollah’s offensive units to personally plan terror attacks against Israeli civilians on the northern border and deep within Israeli territory. ‘Biggest crisis of all’ Gunfire erupted in Beirut on Saturday afternoon – a gesture to mark martyrdom, believed by Muslims to be one of the highest honors in Islam. Many Hezbollah supporters were initially skeptical after Israel said it believed Nasrallah had been killed. Moments before Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death, a woman and a man said they expected the group’s leader to “surprise us all with an appearance.” “He’s not in Lebanon. I know in my heart he isn’t,” said one elderly Shia woman in a black chador, smiling. Less than five minutes later, the announcement of his death came. “He was martyred,” she kept repeating. “This is the biggest crisis of all,” she added. A man trying to console her said: “Martyrdom was what he wanted … And it’s what he received.” Another woman broke down crying as she recited verses from the Quran with tears streaming down her face. In the Dahiyeh neighborhood, where Nasrallah was killed, loud chants of: “We submit to you Nasrallah,” and “We will never accept humiliation,” were heard.

His death caps a series of devastating blows for the group, already reeling from the humiliation of having its communications network comprehensively infiltrated, and suggests that one of Israel’s most formidable enemies is deeply wounded. One of the founding members of the group formed four decades ago with the aid of Iran, Nasrallah ascended to the top of Hezbollah in 1992. He replaced his predecessor and mentor, Abbas Musawi, as secretary-general of Hezbollah, after he was killed by an Israeli helicopter strike. Born to a grocer and his wife in Beirut in August 1960, Nasrallah spent his early adolescence under the shadow of Lebanon’s civil war. His family were forced to flee the capital when the fighting erupted in 1975, moving further south to a village near the coastal city of Tyre. One year later, Nasrallah moved to Iraq to attend a Shiite seminary. But he was swiftly expelled during the persecution of Shiite Muslims under Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s repressive regime – returning to Lebanon to study under his teacher, Musawi. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, responding to attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organization, Nasrallah rallied a group of fighters to resist the occupation – which would evolve into Hezbollah. Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon’s territory that year , and were held responsible for the killing of at least 17,000 people, according to reports and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at a Beirut refugee camp. Nasrallah, pictured on March 11, 1999, addresses guerrillas battling Israeli forces in Lebanon's occupied south. Hezbollah was formed more than a decade earlier, by Lebanese fighters resisting Israel's invasion. Ho New/Reuters Transformation of Hezbollah Known for his fiery speeches, the leader oversaw the transformation of Hezbollah, from a rag-tag group of militants in the 1980s to an organization that mounted a concerted campaign to drive out Israeli occupation in 2000. The Lebanese militant group became a regional fighting force under Nasrallah. He led the growth of Hezbollah’s forces – his fighters and reservists are thought to number 100,000 – as well as the proliferation of its arsenal, which boasts long-range as well as medium and short-range missiles and drones. Nasrallah commands a dedicated following of hundreds of thousands of largely Shiite Muslims – in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. His influence in the Iran-backed so-called axis of resistance grew exponentially after the US assassinated Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani, the architect of the region-wide axis, in 2020 . Hezbollah is the most robustly armed non-state group in the region – and is the most dominant political force in crisis-ridden Lebanon. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization . People sit in a cafe in Beirut to watch a speech by Nasrallah, on September 19.

Fears of an all-out war peaked earlier this month, after Israel unleashed a wave of lethal explosions across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah fighters. Many of those killed were civilian bystanders . In the days since, hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon have been forced from their homes by Israeli attacks . In total, since October 7, more than 1,500 civilians in Lebanon have been killed and over 200,000 people displaced, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Lebanese officials estimate the true number of displaced is closer to half a million. Human rights advocates have fiercely condemned the violence – including UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who warned that Lebanon is suffering its bloodiest period “in a generation” and called on Israel and Hezbollah to “stop the killing and destruction.”"

As Iran watches its most prized non-state ally take a beating, questions are raised about how it might respond.","Sep 28, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Abbas Al Lawati,Middle East,"CNN — Israel’s audacious assassination of Hezbollah’s leader on Friday has rattled the group, delivering its most severe blow since its founding. This has led its Iranian backers to warn that Israel has entered a dangerous phase of the conflict by altering the rules of engagement. As Tehran watches its most prized non-state ally take a beating, questions are mounting about how it may respond. The Jewish state significantly escalated its yearlong conflict with the group after expanding its Gaza war objectives on September 17 to include its northern front with Hezbollah. The following day, thousands of pagers used by its members exploded simultaneously, with walkie-talkies targeted the day after that. Israel then began an air assault that killed several Hezbollah commanders and led to the highest number of casualties in Lebanon in almost two decades. And on Friday, Israel struck what it said was Hezbollah’s headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut, killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah. How much has Hezbollah been degraded? The Israeli military has claimed that the group’s chain of command “has been almost completely dismantled ” after it killed a series of what it says are top officials in the organization this week. “Hezbollah has taken the biggest blow to its military infrastructure since its inception. In addition to losing weapon depots and facilities, the group has lost most of its senior commanders, and its communications network is broken,” said Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and author of “Hezbollahland.” Rescuers sift through the rubble at the scene of an Israeli strike that targeted Beirut's southern suburbs a day earlier, as search and rescue operations continue on September 21. AFP/Getty Images Despite its losses however, the group still retains skilled commanders and many of its most powerful assets , including precision-guided missiles and long-range missiles that could inflict significant damage to Israel’s military and civilian infrastructure, said Ghaddar. Most of those missiles haven’t been deployed yet. Since Israel stepped up its campaign, Hezbollah’s military performance “has proven that it was able to absorb that shock and was able to bounce back and it has been striking hard at northern Israel for days now,” said Amal Saad, Hezbollah expert and lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University in Wales. On Wednesday, Israel intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Hezbollah near Tel Aviv, an unprecedented attack that reached deep into the country’s commercial heartland. Hezbollah said it targeted the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence agency. CNN Related article Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide While Nasrallah’s killing is unlikely to disrupt the operational continuity of the movement it is “obviously a massive, massive demoralization amongst its ranks and supporters and absolute terror which will temporarily paralyze ordinary people” within the movement, said Saad. “That doesn’t mean the organization is paralyzed,” she added. “Hezbollah is an organization that was built to absorb these types of shocks… it’s built to be resilient and outlast individual leaders.” Few contenders for Hezbollah’s leadership can match Nasrallah’s popularity, said Ghaddar, as he is closely associated with the group’s “golden days,” including the end of Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 and the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, both of which were viewed as major victories for the Lebanese group. If the group’s leadership is truly dismantled and coordination between Iran and Hezbollah is disrupted, it could prompt Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to take the lead, according to Ghaddar. “They (Iran) will have to find a way to do it themselves. But it’s not an easy option as they will (become) targets, and they don’t understand Lebanon.” Under what circumstances would Iran intervene? Ahead of the attempt on Nasrallah’s life, Iran’s official line was that Hezbollah is capable of defending itself, even as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged on Wednesday that Israel’s killing of the group’s leaders was “ definitely a loss. ” Following Friday’s airstrike however, Iran’s embassy in Lebanon indicated that Tehran’s calculations might now be shifting. “There is no doubt that this reprehensible crime and reckless behavior represent a serious escalation that changes the rules of the game, and that its perpetrator will be punished and disciplined appropriately,” the embassy said on X. Iran’s rationale for avoiding involvement in the conflict may no longer hold, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Washington DC-based Quincy Institute. “If it becomes clear (to Iran) that Hezbollah actually cannot defend itself following the bombing in Beirut, particularly if Nasrallah himself was killed, then the Iranian justification for staying out of the war has collapsed,” he said. “At that point, Iran’s credibility with the rest of its partners in the Axis (of regional militant groups) will risk collapsing if Tehran does not react.” Ambulances arrive at American University of Beirut Medical Center as almost 3,000 people, including Hezbollah fighters and medics, are injured by exploding pagers, in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 17. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Iran is likely “horrified by the effectiveness and efficiency” of Israel’s attacks but despite the targeting of Hezbollah’s top leadership, Tehran may still believe the group can defend itself and dictate the terms of an eventual ceasefire, which would help the group recover, according to  Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute. Tehran is most probably already helping Hezbollah rebuild its military command structure and providing tactical and operational advice to its leadership, he said. However, if the group nears collapse, it could “prompt a more assertive Iranian intervention,” potentially in the form of missile and drone strikes, as seen in April when Iran blamed Israel for attacking its diplomatic building in Damascus. Nadimi added that while a larger attack is unlikely, it’s not entirely out of the question. Saad, the Hezbollah expert from Cardiff University, said an intervention by Iran would likely drag the United States into the war, noting that Tehran was “the weakest link” in the conflict. “It’s the only member of the Axis that is an actual state. All the others are non-state or quasi-state actors. So, Iran has the most to lose if it participates,” she said. “(Iran) is a conventional armed force, it would probably not fare anywhere near as well as Hezbollah would in a war because it’s a completely different military infrastructure,” Saad noted. “Hezbollah knows its terrain and adversary better than anyone else.” Why Hezbollah matters to Iran Since its inception 40 years ago, the Lebanese militant group has been the crown jewel of Tehran’s so-called Axis of Resistance , a group of mostly Shiite, Iran-allied Islamist militias spanning Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen that gives Iran strategic depth against its adversaries. As a non-Arab, Shiite state, Iran sees itself as “strategically lonely” in the Middle East and therefore sees Shiites in the Sunni-dominated region “as the closest thing it has to natural allies,” Parsi said..

Can Israel afford another all-out war? “From Tehran’s perspective, Hezbollah is central to the Axis because of its capabilities and discipline, its geographical placement, and its ideological and political proximity to Iran’s Islamic Republic,” Parsi added. “The destruction of Hezbollah is not in the cards in my assessment, but if it were to occur, that would be an existential blow to the Axis.” The group is essential to “maintain a strong military component on the northern borders of Israel and keep Israel off-balance,” said Nadimi from the Washington Institute. “It will be important to maintain Hezbollah as a viable and resilient actor and ally,” he said. “Iran has designed Hezbollah with resiliency in mind and believes they can take a lot more beating before Iran feels compelled to intervene directly.” Iran looks to improve ties with the West But Iran also has domestic considerations. The escalation between Hezbollah and Israel comes at a delicate time for Iran’s new reformist president, who campaigned on improving foreign relations to lift Tehran out of the isolation that has crippled its economy. Just this week, President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the United Nations that his country is ready to engage with the West on its disputed nuclear program. He has named as his Vice President Javad Zarif, the seasoned, US-educated diplomat who became the face of Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, abandoned by the administration of former US President Donald Trump in 2018. Parsi, from the Quincy Institute, said the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 and the subsequent escalation with Hezbollah “were very badly timed” for Tehran, since they “risked prematurely bringing forward a confrontation between Iran, Hezbollah and Israel at a time that is much more strategically suitable for Israel than the Axis.” Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian addresses the 79th United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York on September 24, 2024. Mike Segar/Reuters At home, Pezeshkian must navigate between his reformist constituency, which favors detente with the West, and hardline elements within the regime that want a show of force against Israel. On Monday, the day nearly 500 Lebanese were killed in Israeli airstrikes, Pezeshkian stated in New York that Iran was ready to “lay down arms if Israel does the same.” The remark sparked intense backlash from hardliners at home for appearing weak in front of the enemy, according to reports . His statement, along with his offer to reconcile with the West in his speech to the UN General Assembly the following day, also drew criticism in some Lebanese media. Given the “profound unhappiness of much of the Iranian public” with the regime, Pezeshkian’s priority is national reconciliation, said Parsi. Still, if Hezbollah is seriously degraded, “Tehran may face a situation in which it will conclude that war is at its doorstep whether it chooses it or not and that it is, as a result, better off responding before Hezbollah is further weakened,” he said. Wary of Israel’s ‘trap’ Asked this week by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour if Iran would consider intervening in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Vice President Zarif said Tehran was wary of falling into “Israel’s trap,” which he said was aimed at expanding the hostilities by dragging other parties into it, including the US. He said that both Iran and Hezbollah had exercised restraint in the face of Israeli attacks, “but now the Israelis are crossing the line, in my view, and there is every prospect of the war getting more difficult to contain.” Hezbollah was capable of defending itself, he added, but it was incumbent on the international community to step in before the situation gets “out of hand.” Iran has yet to carry out the revenge it promised Israel after the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. This week however, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that his country would not remain “indifferent” if a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in Lebanon. “We stand with the people of Lebanon with all means,” he said at a news conference in New York ahead of a UN Security Council meeting."

And again, we anticipate that we’d see a number of people displaced, casualties that, you know, equal or exceed what we’ve seen in Gaza,” Austin told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. The defense secretary, reiterating the US desire for a “diplomatic solution,” also said a possible ground incursion by Israeli forces into Lebanon risks spiraling the situation into a regional conflict. The US and several prominent allies believed they had achieved a 21-day pause in fighting that would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said reports of an imminent deal were “incorrect” and vowed to continue to hit the Iran-backed militant group “with all our might.” Netanyahu spoke at the United Nations General Assembly Friday morning, where he vowed to continue Israel’s military efforts and warned that “there is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach.” US-led efforts to secure a ceasefire appear to have failed, and CNN has reported that the Biden administration has all but paused a push for a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Asked by Blitzer if continued US aid to Israel undermines Washington’s efforts to secure a ceasefire in Lebanon, Austin on Friday reiterated the long-standing alliance. “We’ve been clear from the very beginning that that we’re going to support Israel in its efforts to defend itself,” Austin said. “We’ve done that from the very beginning, and we’re going to continue to do that going forward.” Recent hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began after Israel decided to make returning displaced residents to their homes near the northern border an official goal of its war aims. Tens of thousands of Israelis who live in the area were evacuated shortly after the October 2023 Hamas terrorist attack, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into the region. In recent days, Israel has launched a series of strikes that have targeted Hezbollah’s leadership, and Israel’s military chief said earlier this week that the nation was preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon. Austin also was asked by Blitzer about US support for Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelensky, met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday and is meeting with former President Donald Trump on Friday. Amid ongoing debates in Washington about continued aid to the eastern European nation — especially if Trump, who has been skeptical about such support, is elected — the US is under pressure to allow Ukraine to fire long-range weapons deep into Russia. Austin said US policy about the use and range of certain weapons has not changed but said the US can’t dictate how Ukraine should use “their” weapons. “What we’ve seen recently is that Ukraine has the ability to now produce its own weaponry in terms of (unmanned aerial vehicles) that are proving to be very, very effective in that fight,” Austin said. “And some of these UAVs can range out beyond 400 kilometers, which is beyond the range of (US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems) or Storm Shadow or anything else that we would be able to provide them.” He also declined to answer a question from Blitzer about whether US policy toward Ukraine has been “irreversibly politicized” in the wake of Republican reluctance to continue arming the US ally. “Our focus will remain on making sure that we’re giving Ukraine everything that we can provide, that will prove effective in this fight,” he said.

Lebanese security officials watched a series of controlled explosions of some of the weaponized pagers , as investigations into who manufactured the wireless communication devices and how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets continued. The pagers used in the controlled explosions were switched off at the time of the attack on September 17, which meant they did not receive the message that caused the compromised devices to detonate. The officials had a front-row seat to see just how catastrophic the blasts would have been to those carrying the devices and others around them. Thousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members last week, targeting their pagers on Tuesday, and then walkie-talkies a day later. In all, the blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders. The attack blindsided the group , which had opted for analogue technologies after forgoing cell phones to avoid Israeli infiltration. A photo taken on September 18, 2024, in Beirut's southern suburbs shows the remains of exploded pagers on display at an undisclosed location. AFP/Getty Images Israel has not commented directly on the attacks, but CNN has learned that the explosions were the result of a joint operation by Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, tacitly acknowledged his country’s role the day after the pager attack, praising “excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad.” Both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks. One of the Lebanese security sources told CNN the way in which the explosive material had been hidden inside the pagers’ batteries was so sophisticated that it could not be detected, but did not elaborate further as to what sort of checks the devices had gone through before entering the country. The second high-ranking security source said that he had examined one of the compromised pagers and witnessed its controlled explosion. He told CNN that the explosive material was “laced” inside the pager’s lithium battery and virtually undetectable. He added that he had never seen anything like it. An improvised explosive device has five key components: A power source, an initiator, a detonator, an explosive charge and a case to put it all in. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said that only a detonator and explosive charge would have been needed to weaponize the pagers, which already have the other three components. “It had to be done in such a way to make it invisible,” Moorhouse said, adding that one way to do that could have been modifying the battery itself – implanting an electronic detonator and small explosive charge inside of its metal casing, which would have made it impossible to detect with imaging, for example X-rays. People gather outside American University of Beirut Medical Center on September 17, 2024, as people wounded in the pager attack pour in for treatment. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Other experts who reviewed footage of the blasts also said that explosive devices appeared to have been hidden in the pagers, suggesting a sophisticated supply chain attack involving a state actor. That tallied with initial assessments by Lebanese authorities. Lebanon’s mission to the United Nations said in a letter sent to the UN Security Council last Friday that a preliminary investigation found that the communications devices were implanted with explosives before arriving in the country, tampered with “in a professional way” by “foreign entities.” Lebanese authorities determined that the devices were detonated by sending electronic messages to them, according to the letter, which was seen by CNN. Israel was responsible for carrying out the attacks, which detonated thousands of devices simultaneously, Lebanon’s UN mission said. Mysterious supply chain stretches from Taiwan to Hungary Multiple photos from the aftermath of last week’s attacks in Lebanon show remnants of the exploded pagers – also known as beepers – that were consistent with a model made by a Taiwanese firm, Gold Apollo , and fragments of walkie-talkies identified as the make of a Japanese firm, ICOM. Lebanese authorities have said that the devices used in the attacks were Gold Apollo Rugged Pager AR-924 pagers and ICOM IC-V82 walkie-talkies. Both Gold Apollo and ICOM have distanced themselves from the compromised devices. ICOM said that the IC-V82 model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether the devices targeted in Lebanon were counterfeit or shipped from its company. Counterfeit versions are widely available for purchase on e-commerce websites, like Alibaba. Lebanon’s communications ministry said the IC-V82 radios used in the attacks were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services. International investigative efforts have largely zeroed in on the Gold Apollo AR-924 pagers – tracing the model’s licensing and manufacturing from Taiwan to apparent shell companies to try to establish how the Israeli operation may have been carried out. The New York Times reported , citing three intelligence officers briefed on the operation, that Israel had set up at least three shell companies to disguise the identities of those making the pagers – Israeli intelligence officers. The chairman and founder of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, Hsu Ching-kuang, was questioned by Taiwanese prosecutors last Thursday before being released.

Yan Zhao/AFP/Getty Images A day earlier, at the nondescript offices of Gold Apollo on the outskirts of the Taiwanese capital, Hsu, speaking to CNN and other media, vehemently denied having made the pagers bearing his company’s brand name, claiming instead that they were manufactured by a Hungarian firm, BAC Consulting. Hsu told CNN he had entered into a licensing agreement with the Budapest-registered company, signing over “sole responsibility” for the production and sale of the AR-924 model. A person called Teresa was one of his contacts for the deal, he said. Teresa Wu, a former Gold Apollo employee, was also seen leaving the prosecutors’ office in New Taipei City last Thursday evening, according to reporting by Reuters and local media staked out outside. Prosecutors in Taiwan currently list Hsu and Wu as witnesses, two senior officials in Taiwan told CNN. A person with knowledge of Gold Apollo told CNN that Wu had left the company a couple of years ago, and that they understood she had started working for BAC Consulting. CNN has reached out to Wu for comment. The logo of Taiwanese company Gold Apollo is seen outside its office in New Taipei City on September 18, 2024. Yan Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Related article Who made Hezbollah’s exploding devices? Questions swirl around a mysterious supply chain stretching from Taiwan to Hungary Wu set up a company called Apollo Systems Ltd in April of this year, listed under a Taipei address that appears to be a co-working space, according to corporate records. It is not clear if Wu was operating for BAC Consulting in Taipei under her new company name, Apollo Systems Ltd. Apollo Systems Ltd lists its website address as “www.apollosystemshk.com,” according to a database maintained by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. The Apollo Systems HK website – which was shut down by its administrator after the attack – said that the business had a manufacturing and sales hub in Taipei City and a logistics office in Hong Kong. When CNN visited the Hong Kong address, there was no sign of the company. In December 2022 and February 2023, a YouTube channel for Apollo Systems HK uploaded two videos of the Gold Apollo AR-924 pager touting its “high-capacity lithium rechargeable battery” and other features. On its YouTube channel and website, Apollo Systems HK said that it had acquired the “sole distribution rights” to Gold Apollo pager systems. It also listed the AR-924 model as a product available for purchase. The two senior Taiwanese officials who spoke with CNN said that there was no record of Gold Apollo manufacturing any AR-924 pagers in Taiwan. The officials also confirmed that Gold Apollo only manufactured pagers with AA batteries in Taiwan, not lithium batteries as found in the devices used in the attack and examined by Lebanese officials, according to CNN’s sources. Customs records in Taiwan, cited by the officials, showed that Gold Apollo shipped more than 20,000 pagers from Taiwan to the United States in the first eight months of 2024. More than 5,000 pagers were shipped to Hong Kong, while more than 3,000 pagers were shipped to Australia. The Taiwanese officials said they had also checked the order history and the source of raw components for Gold Apollo pagers, adding that pager manufacturing was tightly controlled in Taiwan and that devices undergo regular inspections. The Taiwanese prosecutors’ office is reviewing documents it obtained from Gold Apollo’s office. In a statement last Thursday, the prosecutors’ office said that there had “been no evidence found so far to suggest any involvements (sic) of Taiwanese nationals in the explosive terror attack.” Investigations into the supply chain are also ongoing in Europe, where authorities are probing the Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, and another firm linked to Bulgaria and Norway, for any connections to the pager attack targeting Hezbollah. CNN has attempted to reach BAC Consulting at its registered address, which is located in a residential area of Budapest. Last Wednesday, a receptionist working at the building said that BAC Consulting rented a space at the address but that no representative had ever physically been there. CNN has also reached out to BAC Consulting’s chief executive, Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, but has yet to receive a response. NBC News reported that Bársony-Arcidiacono had confirmed to the news outlet in a phone call that her company worked with Gold Apollo, but said, “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate.” Reporters gathered outside the registered address for BAC Consulting in Budapest, Hungary, on September 18, 2024. Jakub Porzycki/Anadolu/Getty Images/File There is no record of Gold Apollo exporting any pagers to Hungary in 2023 or 2024, the two Taiwanese officials said, citing custom records in Taiwan. In 2022, the company exported about 200 pagers to Hungary, they added. Hungarian intelligence services have interviewed Bársony-Arcidiacono several times as part of their investigation into BAC Consulting but have not found any evidence that the pagers used in the attack were manufactured in the country, the government’s press office said in a statement. “The results have clearly established that the so-called ‘beepers’ were never present on Hungarian soil, and no Hungarian company or expert was involved in their production or modification,” it said. Bulgarian authorities said they were investigating Norta Global Ltd after Hungarian media reported last week that the Sofia-based company was involved in the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah. Bulgaria’s national security agency DANS said that no pagers used in the attack were “imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria,” and that Norta Global Ltd had not carried out terrorist financing, or traded with anyone subject to sanctions. Bulgaria’s caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev told reporters last Friday that the company under investigation was “a cash flow, mailbox-type of firm,” and that its director “acted by proxy.” According to a report by Dezső András, a journalist with Hungarian news outlet Telex , Norta Global Ltd transferred more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) to BAC Consulting in several instalments between March 2023 and June 2024, money that was later sent by BAC in various payments to Gold Apollo, Apollo Systems Ltd and an unnamed Hong Kong firm. The report added that customs data from October 2022 showed that Apollo Systems Ltd. had sent one shipment to Hungary: A package containing just one pager. Norta Global Ltd was founded in April 2022 by Rinson Jose, a Norwegian national, according to Bulgarian business registration documents. CNN has tried to contact Jose on multiple platforms for comment, but he has not yet responded. Norway’s security police have started a preliminary probe into the company’s reported links to the pagers, according to a police attorney at the Norwegian Police Security Service. Hezbollah digs into devices’ supply chain Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, in an address last Thursday, said that the militant group had formed multiple internal investigative committees to get to the bottom of what happened, vowing a “reckoning” for those responsible. “Regarding the explosions, we have reached an almost certain conclusion, but we still need some time to confirm it,” Nasrallah said. “This entire matter is under thorough investigation and review, from the company that sold the devices, to manufacturing, transportation, arrival in Lebanon, and distribution, all the way to the moment of the explosion.” He added that while the apparent goal of the attack was to kill as many senior Hezbollah officials as possible, much of the leadership had been unaffected because they were carrying older pager models, suggesting that the form of communication has been used by the group for some time. “The new ones were sent elsewhere,” he said, apparently referring to the batch of pagers a Lebanese security source told CNN was purchased by Hezbollah in recent months. People watch a speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as they sit in a cafe in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, on September 19, 2024. Hassan Ammar/AP “These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons, simultaneously exploding across marketplaces, on street corners, and in homes as daily life unfolds,” UN human rights chief Volker Türk told the Security Council last Friday. “Authorities have reportedly dismantled unexploded devices in universities, banks, and hospitals.” He added that simultaneously targeting thousands of people – whether civilians or armed forces – without the knowledge of who is in possession of the targeted devices and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law. Iran’s delegate to the UN said that Israel had intended to kill at least 5,000 civilians, but some devices were deactivated or not distributed. The delegate said that Israel had again “crossed a red line,” noting that Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured. Senior UN officials warned that the devices attack marked a turning point, calling for de-escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza before a war consumes the whole of the Middle East. Others said that the technology apparently used marked “dangerous new territory” in the world of warfare.

In a hastily arranged call with reporters just moments after the release of a joint statement, top administration officials hailed the framework as “an important breakthrough.” The 21-day pause in fighting that the nations were proposing would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah. Those officials were clear: The question was not if Israel and Hezbollah would accept the ceasefire proposal, but precisely when. Both Israel and Hezbollah were “familiar with the text,” one official said, and the US felt comfortable going public with the framework, with the understanding that both sides were ready to sign on.

First, the prime minister’s office released a statement saying any reports of an imminent ceasefire was “incorrect” and that the IDF would continue fighting with “full force.” Then, the prime minister himself told the press as he got off his plane in New York City: “My policy, our policy, is clear: We continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might. We will not stop until we achieve all our goals.” Some 24 hours after the White House’s announcement of the ceasefire proposal, there has still been no indication that Israel and Hezbollah are ready to agree to it. Israel’s initial response was clearly not the reaction the White House had anticipated, and it raised immediate question of why, if Israel was on board with the proposal, its leader appeared so eager to dismiss it. “We are shocked,” said one US official, underscoring deep frustration after they had hoped Israel would accept the proposal. “Not a complete surprise, but also not helpful,” a second US official said. There were quiet rumblings in Washington that domestic politics could be at play for Netanyahu, as right-wing Israeli ministers – whom Netanyahu had depended upon to maintain his governing coalition – expressed indignation at reports of a US-backed ceasefire. One US source who suggested that the Israeli government was being swayed by the negative reaction to the proposal at home expressed frustration, saying the US would not have come out with such optimism had there not been strong private indications that the Israelis were prepared to accept the framework. The source said they did not expect negotiations to wrap up in the coming days, saying they expected the process to be long. And as long as Israel does not publicly accept it, they added, Hezbollah won’t feel pressure to either. American officials’ confidence in announcing the proposal on Wednesday had been derived, in part, because they were dealing with Ron Dermer, one of Netanyahu’s closest confidants, as they wrote and revised the statement’s text. Discussions on the ceasefire began with a conversation Monday between Dermer and Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. The impression the US officials received was that Netanyahu would support a pause in fighting, and they were encouraged to work with French officials to complete a statement that urged a 21-day ceasefire. Speaking Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be a “mistake” for Netanyahu to reject the ceasefire, but added the United States would need to increase pressure on Israel to accept its terms. Netanyahu’s apparent reversal amounted to a major disappointment, but for some officials it also underscored a reality that has existed for months: Netanyahu’s willingness to break publicly and openly with Biden, particularly when he faces internal political opposition in Israel.

Asked about the apparent disconnect between the US and Israel, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the multi-nation statement was “indeed coordinated with the Israeli side.” Discussions between the negotiations parties in New York are “ongoing,” she continued, but failed to explain why Netanyahu and his office appeared wholly uninterested in agreeing to the temporary ceasefire. White House spokesman John Kirby was even more blunt in acknowledging that he had no good explanation for Netanyahu’s comments. “I can’t speak for Prime Minister Netanyahu, I can’t answer the question why he said what he said,” he told reporters. “What I can tell you is that statement we worked on last night wasn’t just drawn up in a vacuum,” Kirby added. “It was done after careful consultation, not only with the countries that signed on to it, but Israel itself.” Kirby even acknowledged that the plan would not have been released Wednesday night had the US not believed Netanyahu and his government was on board. For now, administration officials continue to insist that discussions are ongoing and expressed hope that news could come within hours. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top Israeli officials in New York Thursday afternoon, even as many US officials were open to the possibility that Netanyahu may not get on board. Dermer and Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog demurred when asked by CNN ahead of that meeting if they are going to accept the ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah. Dermer quipped that “less is more” when speaking as a diplomat, and pointed out that their day of meetings was only just getting started. This story has been updated with additional details."

The proposal, described by one senior US official as an “important breakthrough,” comes amid deadly fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that many fear could spill into a wider conflict. Hoping to prevent such an outcome, diplomats and leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly spent the last 48 hours hurriedly working to secure a plan that would pause the fighting and allow room for diplomacy to take hold. Israel and Hezbollah have yet to agree. But US officials said both parties were “familiar” with the contours of the proposal and voiced optimism the moment was right for it to be revealed publicly. “The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,” read a joint statement from the nations released late Wednesday. President Joe Biden said the plan had been endorsed by the United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. “We were able to generate significant support from Europe, as well as the Arab nations,” Biden told reporters late Wednesday. “It’s important this war not widen.” The immediate objective of the agreement is to lower temperatures and allow residents along the border to return to their homes in Israel and Lebanon. But officials also hope the ceasefire being proposed could “open up diplomatic space” and “galvanize” a stalled ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas to halt the fighting and free the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, senior administration officials asserted in the moments after the framework was announced. Plan is the result of ‘an all-out effort’ The plan was announced after what one Biden administration official called “an all-out effort by the administration” to secure a cessation in hostilities as the conflict threatens to widen into a larger regional war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent the past few days shuttling back and forth between Arab and European partners working on the details of a proposal to stop the fighting between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah. Biden has been discussing the escalating hostilities in the Middle East with various world leaders this week on the sidelines of the General Assembly. On Wednesday, he discussed the matter with Macron, the White House said, helping to finalize the plan. Blinken led intensive behind-the-scenes diplomacy on the sidelines of the UN gathering to help broker the ceasefire proposal, a US official said. On Monday, he soft-launched the idea to his G7 counterparts, though didn’t share specific details. The ceasefire proposal was negotiated with both sides before it was rolled out publicly, according to a senior administration official. On Wednesday, Blinken and White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, one of the mediators conveying details to Hezbollah. The US had been conveying messages to Hezbollah through mediators for several days. On the margins of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting on Wednesday morning, Blinken separately pulled aside both Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask for the countries’ support for the proposal, which they both gave. Blinken dispatched his deputy chief of staff, Tom Sullivan, on Wednesday morning to meet with the political directors of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to get their support for the framework. US officials were optimistic Wednesday night that both sides will accept the deal, but some diplomats told CNN that they are concerned about both sides respecting their commitment to the ceasefire. Hope to kickstart Gaza talks After months of painstaking and so far unsuccessful negotiations to end the war in Gaza and free remaining hostages, officials said they believed this latest proposal could shake loose the moribund talks . “It buys some time and space to try to pursue an arrangement in Gaza…and the hostage deal we’ve been discussing,” one of the officials said. “And if (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar understands there is not going to be a broader regional conflict, there really is a choice here. You do the deal, release the hostages, you get an awful lot of calm in Gaza.” Earlier Wednesday night, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the United Nations Security Council that France has been working with the US to secure a 21-day ceasefire to allow negotiations and that details would be made public soon. “A diplomatic solution is indeed possible,” he said, adding that he would travel to Beirut at the end of the week to work with local stakeholders. A source said that the effort to mediate a ceasefire began in earnest for the Biden administration after Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke on the phone with top Israeli official Ron Dermer on Monday. The efforts come as Israel’s top general said Wednesday that the Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given the green light for his government to engage with the US efforts, an Israeli official told CNN. The official said that Netanyahu gave his approval with the understanding that any agreement would have to allow for the return of Israeli civilians to their homes in northern Israel. Hezbollah has long said they would only stop their rocket fire when there was quiet in Gaza, while Israel has tried to treat the two fronts as separate conflicts. The White House has also consistently argued that a ceasefire in Gaza would unlock much more, including a diplomatic deal with Hezbollah that would allow Lebanese and Israeli civilians to return home. Given the fear of escalation, American and other international officials are pushing for a deal first to end the skyrocketing Lebanon fighting so that they can then turn back to the Gaza ceasefire efforts that have been stuck. Biden and his top national security officials have regularly expressed optimism and hope that deals for both were close at hand, only to see them fall apart. Recently, US officials have said they don’t know whether Netanyahu or Sinwar have the political willingness to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking on ABC’s daytime talk show “The View,” Biden alluded to ongoing talks to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon that would unlock further peace discussions elsewhere in the region. “There’s a way to do it, and they have a possibility – I don’t want to exaggerate it, but a possibility — if we can deal with a ceasefire in Lebanon, that it can move into dealing with the West Bank, but we also have Gaza to deal with,” he said. “But it’s possible,” he said, “and I’m using every bit of energy I have with my team … to get this done. There’s a desire to see change in the region.” CNN’s Donald Judd contributed to this report. This story has been updated with additional developments."

The comments come after Israel ramped up its airstrikes in Lebanon and shot down a missile that Hezbollah said it had aimed at the headquarters of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, near Tel Aviv – the first time the Iran-backed militant group has tried to strike so deeply into Israeli territory.

Hassan Jarrah/AFP/Getty Images Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was calling up two reserve brigades because of the conflict with Hezbollah. Israel’s top general in the north, Ori Gordin, had also warned the military “must be fully prepared for maneuvers.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country “will not rest” until the northern residents can return home. “I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing: we are determined to return our residents in the north safely to their homes,” the prime minister said, amid Israel’s intense wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. “We are inflicting blows on Hezbollah that [they] did not imagine. We do it with power, we do it with guile. I promise you one thing - we will not rest until they come home,” he added. Israel has drastically stepped up its strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon this month, as it begins to pivot away from its nearly year-long war against Hamas in Gaza. Last week, Israel made returning residents to their homes in the north an explicit war aim. The next day, hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah militants exploded across Lebanon. The day after, Hezbollah walkie-talkies also exploded. The twin attacks killed dozens and injured thousands. Israel did not say it was behind the attacks, but did claim responsibility for an airstrike on southern Beirut the next day, which killed the leader of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, Ibrahim Aqil. This week, another airstrike on Beirut killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, a senior official who commanded Hezbollah’s missile units. Reeling from the biggest-ever hits to its military structure, Hezbollah began to respond, firing hundreds of missiles into Israel over the past week, but Israel’s unrelenting escalations appear to have put the group on the back foot. “You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are,” Halevi told troops Wednesday. “You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.”"

Its strike Wednesday that was intercepted near Tel Aviv managed to be both unprecedented and understated. It marked many firsts: The first time Hezbollah launched what it said was a ballistic missile at Israel; the first time a missile had reached near Tel Aviv from Lebanon; and the first time Hassan Nasrallah, the militant group’s leader, made good on his promise to respond to Israeli strikes on Beirut with Hezbollah’s own on Tel Aviv. But given the strength of Israel’s air defenses, a single missile – even a ballistic one – was always likely to have been shot down. Why, then, launch just one? As the risk of all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah – and their respective American and Iranian backers – grows each day, the lone shot on Tel Aviv could be taken as both a threat and a cease-and-desist. We have powerful weapons at our disposal, and a powerful friend at our beck and call – don’t try us, Hezbollah seemed to say. The militant group’s gloves are far from fully off – the group has a range of medium and long-range missiles in its arsenal –  but Wednesday’s strike appeared to be a signal to indicate how powerful a punch it could pack. This strike is the latest notch in Hezbollah’s managed escalation as it seeks to respond to an intensive Israeli campaign to force the armed group to cease its daily fire at Israel’s northern-most territory. Smoke rises from Israeli airstrikes in the village of Kfar Rouman, southern Lebanon, on Wednesday. Hussein Malla/AP It is worth remembering how we got here. Hezbollah joined the fight against Israel out of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks against Israel. So far, it has avoided a full-scale war with Israel. Until last week, it had largely limited its involvement to near-daily cross-border strikes that the Israeli military has returned. The strikes forced more than 60,000 Israelis to flee their homes in the north of the country, but the number of casualties remained relatively low. The Lebanese side of the border was also emptied of its nearly 100,000 residents in Israeli strikes as part of the cross-fire. But things began to spiral after a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan heights killed 12 Druze children. Israel accused Hezbollah of firing the rocket, which came from the direction of Lebanon, but Hezbollah has “firmly” denied it was behind the strike. For Israeli officials, though, the situation had become untenable. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began to pivot from fighting Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, backed by bellicose allies on his extreme right. For almost a year, Israel had waged its war in Gaza with the twin aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages it had taken. On September 16, Israel added a new objective: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to their homes. The next day, hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah militants exploded across Lebanon. The day after, Hezbollah walkie-talkies also exploded. The twin attacks killed dozens and injured thousands, delivering a humiliating blow to the group. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but CNN has learned the explosions were the result of a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s attacks did not relent. The next day, it launched an airstrike on a multi-story building in a Beirut suburb where a group of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force had met, killing its leader Ibrahim Aqil other high-level figures. This week, another airstrike killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, another senior official who commanded Hezbollah’s missile units. People displaced from their homes seek shelter in the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon, on Wednesday. Fathi Al-Masri/AFP/Getty Images Reeling from the biggest-ever hits to its military structure, Hezbollah has also discreetly expanded its war aims. It said it launched the ballistic missile Wednesday in support of Palestinians in Gaza and, crucially, in “defense of Lebanon and its people” – an explicit recognition that it is now engaged in a conflict to protect its own territory. While both sides have refrained from declaring that they are at war with each other, their ramped-up goals may make that moot. Hezbollah insists there will be no ceasefire in Lebanon until there is one in Gaza. Netanyahu’s government not only insists there will not be a ceasefire in Gaza – its pivot to Lebanon makes the possibility of a deal even more remote. Where do both sides go from here? Neither has much space to back down. As international calls to defuse the tensions grow, many Lebanese residents are not waiting to find out whether they will be successful. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said Israel’s offensive has displaced up to half a million people. Beirut’s streets are emptying, as foreign embassies urge their citizens to flee the country and many Lebanese move even further north. After years of crises, the growing military conflict is inflicting further despair on Lebanon’s increasingly exhausted population. The fact that neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese authorities have called this a war is little consolation for those in throes of bombardment and mass displacement."

People in Tel Aviv and the central city of Netanya woke up to sirens on Wednesday as Israel said its air defenses intercepted a surface-to-surface missile – the first time ever a missile fired by Hezbollah has reached close to the city, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah confirmed it launched a Qadr 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad, which it blames for attacks targeting its members, including the coordinated explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week. It is believed to be the first ballistic missile to be launched by Hezbollah toward Israel, and was fired “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza” and in “defense of Lebanon and its people,” Hezbollah said. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted near Tel Aviv, a city of more than 4 million people on the Mediterranean coast, and the air force struck its launcher in the area of Nafakhiyeh, southern Lebanon. “Following the sirens that sounded in the Tel Aviv and Netanya areas, one surface-to-surface missile was identified crossing from Lebanon and was intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array,” the Israeli military said. Israeli military spokesperson Nadav Shoshani described the missile as “heavy” and “long range.” “It’s the first time that Hezbollah has fired toward Tel Aviv,” he said. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly said that any Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital would prompt an attack on Israel’s economic center. Israel and Hezbollah’s exchange of fire continued Wednesday. Damage is seen at the site of an Israeli strike that hit the Lebanese seaside town of Jiyeh early on Wednesday.

Hasan Fneich/AFP/Getty Images The Israeli military said it hit more than 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Wednesday. At least 51 people were killed in Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the country’s minister of health. Firass Abiad said “large waves” of people had been displaced across the country. Meanwhile, around 40 projectiles crossed from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday morning, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Several were intercepted but one hit an assisted-living facility in northern Israel, with no injuries reported. Since the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas last October, Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets and drones from Lebanon targeting northern Israel. About 60,000 people have been evacuated from Israel’s northern region as a result of the cross-border fighting. Israel has maintained that fighting will continue until it is safe for those residents to return home. The missile intercept comes days after Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah killed more than 500 people across Lebanon, including dozens of children. Monday was the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly two decades. Flights at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport continued as usual Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said. Sirens were heard Wednesday in Netanya for the first time since October 7, 2023, according to Israeli authorities. Misery in Lebanon In recent days, Israel and Hezbollah have traded waves of airstrikes and rocket attacks, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes in southern Lebanon. Israel has said it is targeting Hezbollah positions and infrastructure — which it has said are embedded in residential areas — with one strike killing a senior commander , Ibrahim Qubaisi, on Tuesday. The Israeli military said Qubaisi commanded various Hezbollah missile units and was killed along with two other commanders in southern Beirut. Residents who have fled their homes in Lebanon said residential areas had been flattened and whole towns emptied. One man told CNN he witnessed “non-stop bombardment from every direction” which he described as “indiscriminate bombing.” A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on the village of Sujud.

Meanwhile Lebanese hospitals are struggling with the influx of wounded, and there are difficulties getting those in need to hospital for treatment as roads were congested with people trying to flee from Israeli strikes. British-Palestinian doctor Ghassan Abu-Sittah said the healthcare system is “very, very fragile” as it cannot cope with more than 2,000 injuries in two days. “We have received children with unfortunately, the same pattern of injuries that I used to see in Gaza,” Abu-Sittah told CNN. “Blast injuries in the face, amputations to the limbs, multiple shrapnel injuries, crushing injuries as a result of houses being demolished on top of them.” An estimated half a million people have been displaced in Lebanon, the country’s foreign minister said Tuesday, with that number set to rise further. Om Hussein’s family were among the thousands who fled the country’s south.

That war, however, was not at the top of the agenda in talks with US officials. US President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed instead prioritized their discussions around a set of technological and economic deals between both countries centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and the infrastructure needed to develop the growing technology. “The UAE is a nation of trailblazers that’s always looking to the future – always making big bets… In fact, it’s a cornerstone of our growing cooperation, in AI, in clean energy, in space, in investing in infrastructure to connect regions,” Biden said in the Oval Office on Monday alongside the UAE president. “Today we honor that legacy in carrying our relationship forward as the UAE will become a major defense partner with the United States.” Sheikh Mohammed responded that the UAE has “a firm and unwavering commitment to work with the USA for the sake of deepening the strategic partnership between our two nations” The White House said the leaders charted “an ambitious course” to lead global efforts to develop and expand advanced technologies. Clipped From Video video Related video The UAE is aiming to be an AI superpower The UAE, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020, is looking for a “different architecture” in the region based on “greater communication, stability and, I would say, longer term prosperity,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE president’s diplomatic adviser told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview. The UAE president’s visit to the US “was mostly and almost exclusively about the future,” Gargash said. “It was about the economy. It’s about technology, and about the UAE bid to partner in what is the technology of the future…The AI component was “front and center in the discussion.” The UAE is the second-largest Arab economy, a top oil exporter and major investor in the US economy. One of the US’ closest allies in the Middle East and a major recipient of US arms, it hosts 5,000 US military personnel. It now seeks to significantly upgrade the “360-degree relationship,” according to Gargash, through an ambitious plan to become a regional technology and AI hub as the US moves to protect its national security and tech industries from Chinese influence. The UAE’s relationship with China had already cost Abu Dhabi a multi-billion-dollar weapons deal with the US which would have seen the Gulf country become the first Arab nation to receive F-35 fighter jets, the crown jewel of the US Air Force, as one official told CNN in 2021 . Abandoning advanced Chinese technology The deal, struck under the Donald Trump administration, was seen as a reward for the UAE’s normalization of relations with Israel in 2020. But the Biden administration repeatedly pushed the UAE to drop China’s Huawei Technologies Co. from its telecommunications network, and claimed that the technology could pose a security risk for its weapons systems. Wary of being deprived of US technology, the UAE has since abandoned closer cooperation with China in the field of AI and semiconductors in favor of the US. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi’s state-backed technology firm G42 announced it had agreed not to engage with Chinese companies for advanced technology. The Financial Times reported earlier this year that the company had off-loaded all investments in China as a pledge to its commitment for its “US partners.” In Washington on Tuesday, Sheikh Mohamed met with the chief executives of chipmaker NVIDIA, asset manager Blackrock and Microsoft – three US firms that recently partnered with MGX , an Abu Dhabi-owned firm seeking to raise $100 billion to fund AI infrastructure, AI-enabled technology, and semiconductors in the US and beyond. Despite the focus on technology, discussions with US officials did include the war in Gaza and Lebanon, Gargash said, adding that de-escalation is the “main goal.” Beyond providing humanitarian aid in Gaza, Abu Dhabi has so far refused to contribute to the rebuilding of the territory without a clear commitment by Israel for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “It’s very complicated,” Gargash, who previously served as the UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, said. “We think that maximalist views are hindering the sort of consensus on a day after (the war). And we’re worried without a clear day after, any attempt really at the ceasefire might appear futile.” Still, he defended the UAE’s decision to normalize relations with Israel and said the agreement is a “component of a future Middle East that is based on compromise” and one that could provide a “different architecture” for the region. He said the two pillars of the UAE’s policy are stability and prosperity. “I think we also have a responsibility towards regional stability and regional prosperity….You can’t prosper alone. You have to prosper collectively.”"

In recent days, senior US officials had largely stopped making a vigorous push on the ceasefire negotiations, sources told CNN, having determined there is currently no political will on either side – Hamas or Israel’s – to end the conflict. Even as President Joe Biden and top aides refuse to abandon the effort entirely, a senior Democrat close to the White House summed up the sentiment among some officials involved in those deliberations this way: “We can’t want this more than they want it.” This person also cited a famous line from former Secretary of State James Baker, who in 1990 famously said in a message directed at the Israeli government about a Middle East peace deal: “When you’re serious about this, call us.” Another quote circulating among American officials as they assess the stalled talks is George Mitchell’s description of the process that eventually brought about the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland: “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.” Ending the Gaza conflict is Biden’s top foreign policy goal as he nears the end of his one-term presidency, but the stalled ceasefire talks are threatening to sink the president’s other priorities in the Middle East. With the clock ticking, Biden only made a perfunctory call for a ceasefire during his final United Nations address on Tuesday and planned to discuss the matter with foreign counterparts this week in New York. US officials are still in the early stages of assessing the volatile situation in Lebanon and trying to make sense of whether Israel has a well-defined end-goal when it comes to its northern neighbor. In the immediate aftermath of Israel’s covert attacks that exploded thousands of pagers and walkie talkies across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah operatives, the administration was working to determine how much the group’s capabilities had been degraded as a result. Absent a clear strategy from Israel, they are left hoping Israel’s onslaught might force Hezbollah to the table while avoiding any miscalculation that triggers a regional war. American officials see the two conflicts — in Gaza and now in Lebanon — as difficult to separate, despite Israel’s insistence that it sees them as distinct issues. “It’s a bit of a false dichotomy to suggest that any of these pieces are completely separable from the mass,” a senior State Department official said Monday. Each of them has a logic and set of dynamics to itself, but they are mutually reinforcing in many ways. “So, what we’re trying to do is, even as we continue to try to get at the core conflict that has created so much suffering over the last year, we are equally focused on ensuring that this conflict does not expand, does not intensify and engulf the entire region,” the official said. Some inside the Biden administration believe a change in approach could help hasten the end of the conflict, including bypassing the three-phase deal currently being discussed and moving to a new effort that would lay out in one go the conditions both parties would need to agree to stop fighting. No Plan B right now But there are no indications the US is actively preparing to push for any Plan B for the time being. In fact, there are currently no known plans for some of Biden’s top national security deputies who have made countless treks to the Middle East over the last year to try to facilitate a ceasefire and hostages deal – including CIA Director Bill Burns, Secretary of State Antony Blinken or White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk – to visit Israel with that goal in mind. When Blinken was last in the region earlier this month, his trip notably omitted a stop in Israel. And it’s been more than a month since Biden last spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he doesn’t plan to meet with the Israeli leader when he comes to the United States this week for his own UN speech. Some US officials are concerned that the week of speeches in New York could further inflame tensions, but they are also actively working to setup meetings on the sidelines that could drive forth ideas to end the conflict. Biden’s speech at UNGA Tuesday contained no new proposal for breaking the logjam but claimed that a diplomatic solution is still possible.  American officials continue to describe the talks as essentially moribund, with political will lacking on either side to reach an agreement. An American-drafted “bridging proposal” has yet to be formalized for presentation to Biden or either of the parties in the talks. “There have been difficulties and setbacks. We’ve had challenges getting the prime minister across the line. We’ve had challenges getting Hamas’ leader, Sinwar, across the line. But we’re determined to keep at it,” said Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday on MSNBC. “We stay up nights trying to figure out a way to get across the line on this ceasefire and hostage deal. And we have spoken out directly about our concern when we’ve seen the prime minister not take steps that we think are necessary to get to that deal,” he said. “At the moment, I would say the biggest challenge is actually that Hamas and Sinwar don’t want to do a deal. But if they do, if, if they’re prepared to come to the table, it’ll be incumbent on us to get the prime minister to the table and close this thing out.” As US officials increasingly acknowledge what appears to be the increasingly likely possibility that a ceasefire will not materialize before Biden’s term ends in January, they also accept that that means the president will not see a landmark Saudi Arabia-Israel normalization deal agreed before he leaves office. Unlike in last year’s UN speech, Biden made no mention of the possibility of Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel, which could transform the region, in his address. That likely leaves it to the next president to either continue pursuing such an arrangement or to head in a different direction. Vice President Kamala Harris has frequently cited the importance of reaching a ceasefire and hostage deal but hasn’t detailed any new approach in reaching an agreement. “Ultimately the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done,” she said last week. “I’m not going to disclose private conversations, but I will tell you I’ve had direct conversations with the prime minister, with the president of Israel, with Egyptian leaders and with our allies, and I think we’ve made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done.” Still, if the window for a ceasefire and hostages deal before the end of Biden’s presidency is slowly closing, US officials insist there is always the possibility of an unexpected turn of events in the Middle East that could quickly shift the narrative. The death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is seen as one of the biggest potential game changers. Israeli and American officials alike would heavily celebrate the outcome, and Sinwar’s killing is perhaps among the most widely discussed singular events that has the best shot of prompting an abrupt end to the war. It has been a few weeks since Sinwar last responded to messages from mediators looking to secure a hostage deal, but American officials have not received updated information about his condition."

Terror and despair gripped Lebanese residents as Israeli bombs killed more than 500 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,800 others, authorities said, as residents fled their homes desperate to reach safety. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is changing the “balance of power” on its northern front as its military said it struck 1,600 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon on Monday, followed by more strikes the following day, and has not ruled out the possibility of a ground invasion. On Tuesday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of one of its senior commanders, Ibrahim Qubaisi. The Israeli military earlier claimed it had killed the commander in an airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Several countries have warned the strikes increase the risk of a wider regional war and have called for urgent international pressure to de-escalate the situation. Despite the scale and intensity of Monday’s strikes, neither side is calling the current escalation a war. Here’s what we know. What happened? On Monday, Israel intensified its air campaign on Hezbollah, launching “extensive strikes” targeting the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. It marked the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the 2006 war and hit multiple parts of the country, mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country near Lebanon’s border with Syria and where the militant group has a strong presence. Women, children and medics were among those killed and wounded, Lebanon’s health ministry said Monday. It is unclear how many of the casualties were civilians or Hezbollah militants, but many of the locations described by Israel as Hezbollah targets are also residential neighborhoods and villages. Israel said that among the Hezbollah targets were “cruise missiles” that had a reach of hundreds of kilometers, rockets, and explosive warheads, according to military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, who claimed the munitions were stored in civilian homes. Residents began to flee their homes after their phones began pinging with text messages from Israel and calls from unknown numbers urging them to evacuate immediately. A popular Lebanese radio station said it was hacked and its broadcast interrupted by an Israeli evacuation warning. The Israeli military warned civilians to leave areas in which Hezbollah operates , such as those used to store weapons. Residents said they had little time to flee to safety before the bombing started. One resident in the southern city of Tyre on the coast of Lebanon said he heard Israeli warplanes “raining” bombs near his home from 5 a.m. local time on Monday. Classes in schools and universities were canceled across the country and some flights to and from Beirut were suspended. Many schools were closed to be used as shelters for those seeking refuge. Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet declared a “special situation” across the country, giving it the power to impose restrictions on civilian life including limits on public gatherings, an Israeli official told CNN. The strikes continued throughout Tuesday. An Israeli military spokesperson said 100 projectiles had been fired toward Israel on Tuesday, while Israel said it carried out another round of “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets in Beqaa and several areas of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said it fired multiple rocket barrages into northern Israel, targeting the Ramat David airbase, Meggido airfield, and the Amos base, all located in the vicinity of the town of Afula in northern Israel. It also said it fired rockets at the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, with Israel saying it intercepted most of the projectiles. The Israeli military also said it struck weapons storage facilities in Bint Jbeil, a town in southern Lebanon, after dozens of rockets were fired from the area. Lebanon’s health ministry said six people were killed and 15 injured in the strike on the Ghobeiry neighborhood.

Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, but video shows destruction of residential areas and the large death toll reflects the scale and intensity of the strikes. The nearly 500 killed on Monday alone is roughly half the number of Lebanese killed throughout the entire 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Israeli warplanes were also seen flying over different parts of the country late afternoon, including over Mount Lebanon where Hezbollah does not have a notable presence. Lebanon’s representative to the United Nations General Assembly said there was a mass “exodus” of people fleeing. One Lebanese NGO said more than 100,000 people had been displaced. Residents described seeing buildings collapse and towns being emptied, while images and video show roads blocked by heavy traffic in both directions as people try to flee. Reuters video  from the southern suburbs of Beirut showed debris from damaged buildings and shards of glass littering the ground.

Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said convoys of vehicles evacuating people from areas under fire had been “targeted,” as had two ambulances, a fire truck and a medical center. Two first responders were killed, he added. The death toll on Tuesday climbed to 558 people – including 50 children and 94 women – with a further 1,835 people injured, Abiad said. “We remain in the war and remain in the throes of the attacks. Our responsibilities have not ended,” Abiad added as Israel continued its attacks on Tuesday. The Israeli military said it was trying to “mitigate the harm to Lebanese civilians as much as possible,” Hagari said. Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of long using civilians as human shields while aiming rockets at Israeli citizens. More than 16,500 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the Israeli strikes, the country’s coordinator of government’s emergency preparedness told CNN Tuesday. Why is Israel attacking Lebanon? Hezbollah and Israel have been in conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October, when Israel’s war in Gaza began following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza, and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war with Hamas began. The group has said it will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on. The increasing escalations have once again brought the region to the edge of an all-out war. Last week, Hezbollah – one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the region – was left reeling after a deadly twin attack by Israel, when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members simultaneously exploded across the country. The attack was followed by an Israeli strike on a building in a densely populated southern Beirut, which killed at least 45 people including a top commander and other senior operatives, as well as women and children.

Fadel Itani/AFP/Getty Images The following days saw some of the most intense exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in almost a year of war in Gaza, as the Lebanese militant group fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than has previously been seen and Israel fired hundreds of projectiles into southern Lebanon. It came as Israel made a new war objective to return displaced residents to their homes near the northern border after being evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks. On Monday, Netanyahu said Israel was changing the “security balance” of power in the north, and separately told the security cabinet the country’s aim in Lebanon is to cut “Hezbollah from the war with Hamas,” an Israeli official told CNN. Though weakened militarily and its secretive lines of communication exposed, Hezbollah’s second-in-command has declared “a new chapter” in the confrontations which he called “a battle without limits.” Are Lebanon and Israel at war? While the airstrikes, attacks and rhetoric from both Israel and Hezbollah suggest they are in open conflict, neither side is calling the current escalation a war. The head of Israel’s military Herzi Halevi said it is “preparing for the next phases” and Netanyahu in a televised speech told the people of Lebanon that his country is not at war with them, but with Hezbollah. Iran has warned Israel of “dangerous consequences” following the strikes, with Iran’s president telling CNN on Monday that it risks tipping the region into wider conflict.

Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Leon Panetta told CNN the situation has “crossed a threshold” and warned that “we’re clearly walking into a much wider war.” World leaders will be gathering in New York for the UN General Assembly this week and there are feverish efforts behind the scenes to convince Israel not to escalate further and launch a ground incursion into Lebanon. Though the United States is Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier, a senior State Department official said the US and its partners are attempting to find a diplomatic solution . The US believes that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, but a major concern is that Iran, a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, US officials told CNN.

Sign up here. CNN — After nearly a year of fighting in Gaza, Israel is ramping up hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon, with covert operations targeting communications devices and a ferocious bombing campaign that has left hundreds dead. The fight against Hamas has strained the Israeli military, with soldiers receiving little respite, officials citing army shortages, the economy facing its steepest decline in years, and growing public pressure for a ceasefire and a hostage deal. It is unclear whether Israel intends – or will feel compelled – to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon. But the question looms: Can the country take on a second front? Since October 8, the day after Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, there has been regular cross-border fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. Hezbollah first fired at Israel to protest the war in Gaza, demanding a ceasefire there as a condition to end its attacks. The stakes were raised last week when Israel injured thousands of people across Lebanon, detonating pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. Escalating exchanges of fire have followed. Should Israel enter full-scale war with Hezbollah, experts say it will face a much stronger threat than Hamas – and commensurate costs. “Hezbollah is not Hamas,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv who served in Israel’s National Security Council under three prime ministers. Hezbollah is “a state within a state” with far more sophisticated military capabilities, he told CNN. Over the weekend , the group launched one of its deepest strikes into Israel, with the Israeli military reporting impacts in Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom and Moreshet near the port city of Haifa, around 40 km (25 miles) south of the border.

Chris McGrath/Getty Images The cross-border exchange over the past year has already led to more than 62,000 residents being evacuated from their homes in Israel’s north, and the deaths of 26 Israeli civilians and 22 soldiers and reservists, according to Israeli media. Ahead of the weekend’s escalation, over 94,000 had been displaced and more than 740 killed on the Lebanese side, including some 500 Hezbollah fighters, according to Reuters. Israeli strikes since Monday alone have killed at least another 558 people and led to the displacement of 16,500, according to Lebanese authorities. Here are some of Israel’s main challenges in a potential wider conflict with Hezbollah: A stronger enemy Iran’s closest regional partner, the Shiite Islamist group has not only showcased more sophisticated weaponry over the past year, but it also boasts strategic depth through its allies and partners across the Middle East – including in Iraq and Yemen. While Israel’s military capabilities have improved since its last war in Lebanon in 2006 – when the Jewish state did not yet have its Iron Dome defense system – so has Hezbollah’s arsenal. Military analysts estimate Hezbollah to have between 30,000 and 50,000 troops, but earlier this year its leader Hassan Nasrallah claimed it has more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles. Its biggest military asset is the long-range ballistic missile, of which it is estimated to have thousands, including 1,500 precision missiles with ranges of 250–300 kilometers (155–186 miles). During the weekend attack, Hezbollah said it targeted Israel’s Ramat David airbase with Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, longer-range weapons that are believed to have been used for the first time. The base is some 30 miles from the Lebanese border. The Israeli military did not respond to queries about whether the base was impacted. Israeli emergency services reported that three people were wounded in the attacks. ⁠Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank in Washington DC who focuses on Iran and its proxies, said that the “warhead weight of these projectiles is reminiscent of the heavy Burkan IRAM (improved rocket assisted munition) first introduced last winter against Israel by Hezbollah, but at considerably longer range.” Hezbollah’s attacks using these projectiles “are likely a way the group aims to save face without losing its head following the communications attacks and strike on senior leaders last week by Israel,” Ben Taleblu told CNN. Orna Mizrahi, a Hezbollah expert at INSS said that much of Israel’s ability to fight a two-front war rests on US support. “The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) can fight both fronts for a long time, and we have the capabilities to do it if we have the ammunition from the Americans,” Mizrahi said, adding that if there is a full-scale war, the US will likely intervene to support Israel. Israel also has a huge intelligence advantage, most notably seen in last week’s audacious attacks on Hezbollah’s communications. Stretched military Israel is a small state and its military manpower is not limitless. As it gears up for a possible second war, the IDF is diverting some of its key divisions from Gaza to its northern border. “When you are fighting more than one front, you cannot invest too much in every front,” Mizrahi said. “So it will be a different way of fighting.” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant last week said that “the center of gravity is moving north,” and that “forces, resources, energy” are now being moved. Among those units is Israel’s elite 98th Division. Also known as Utzbat HaEsh, this paratrooper division is believed to consist of 10,000 to 20,000 troops, according to Israeli media. Guzansky said that diverting resources toward Lebanon does not mean the Gaza war is over, but that Netanyahu feels compelled to deal with the northern front amid mounting domestic pressure to facilitate the return of evacuees from the area. Analysts and army officials cited in Israeli media have also repeatedly said the IDF is suffering from shortages. At the outset of the war with Hamas, the military recruited about 295,000 reservists in an effort to boost its manpower. But that number is proving insufficient.

Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images The fighting in Gaza and elsewhere has also taken its toll on soldiers, of whom 715 have so far been killed since October 7, including in the north. “This is the longest (war) of its kind in Israel’s history, longer than the War of Independence in 1948,” Guzansky said, adding that this is Hezbollah and Iran’s goal, “to weaken Israel gradually.” “To fire rockets every day, on a low scale, and to occupy the IDF, to overstretch the IDF,” he said. An economy in decline Israel’s economy has been one of the biggest casualties of the war in Gaza, taking a sharp blow from the early days of the October 7 attack. Thousands of businesses suffered as reservists abandoned their civilian lives to take up arms, and the country’s economy is shrinking at an alarming rate. “It’s devastating on the Israeli economy, on Israeli society,” Guzansky said, adding that the impacts will live on for years to come. Of all 38 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Israel showed the sharpest economic slowdown between April and June of this year, the organization said in its quarterly report. According to OECD data, Israel’s economy shrank by 4.1% in the early months of the war, and continued to contract, albeit at a slower rate, throughout the first and second quarters of 2024. First responders and Israeli security forces gather amid debris and charred vehicles in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel, following a reported strike by Lebanon's Hezbollah on September 22. Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images The contracting economy comes as Israel’s military spending skyrockets. Earlier this year, Amir Yaron, the governor of Israel’s central bank, warned that the war is expected to cost Israel up to 253 billion Israeli shekels ($67 billion) between 2023 and 2025, Israeli media reported . That’s almost 13% of Israel’s GDP, in addition to regular military expenditure, which has stood at an annual 4.5% to 6.5% of GDP, according to World Bank data. An expansion of the conflict has also impacted Israel’s credit rating, making it more expensive to take on debt, with multiple rating agencies downgrading the country since the war began. In a statement last month , credit ratings agency Moody’s warned that an all-out war with Hezbollah or Iran could have significant “credit consequences for Israeli debt issuers.” A legitimacy crisis A second front, especially one that could be far more damaging to Lebanon than to Israel, could be the final straw for many countries already critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, experts said. The global sympathy that Israel received in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attack has turned into sharp criticism due to Israel’s devastating reaction, as it now faces accusations of war crimes and genocide in international courts, which it strongly denies. Domestically, while Israelis showed a greater appetite for fighting at the outset of the Gaza war, polls show that domestic support has waned over the last months. On support for a war with Hezbollah, Israelis appear split on the matter. A survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute think tank in July found that 42% of Israelis think their country should pursue a diplomatic agreement with Hezbollah, despite the chances of an additional conflict in the future, while 38% think Israel should pursue a military victory against the group, even at the cost of significant damage to civilian areas. Despite the split in opinion, there is now less support for war with Hezbollah compared to responses in late 2023, the poll said. Guzansky said that pressure for war is likely more palpable in northern Israel, where “people that don’t have businesses anymore, families (are) broken apart… people (are) being killed.” Many of these residents, who have lived close to the frontline for nearly a year, believe that “only a full-scale war can change the reality in the north,” he added."

Hezbollah began launching drone and rocket attacks against Israel one day later, sparking months of hostilities across what had been Israel’s quietest border for years. The situation escalated last week when Israel carried out covert attacks that detonated Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel followed up by pounding Beirut and southern Lebanon with airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians and Hezbollah leaders in recent days. The group has responded with rocket attacks targeting Israeli sites including Ramat David air base east of Haifa. The US assesses that neither Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in a full-scale war, officials said. But a senior State Department official expressed skepticism to reporters Monday about Israel’s “escalate to de-escalate” strategy. “I can’t recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de-escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation,” the State Department official told reporters Monday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The biggest concern right now is that Iran, which is a key backer of Hezbollah, will get involved, the first official said. Tehran has not intervened yet, but they will if they believe they are about to lose their most powerful proxy force, Hezbollah, the official added. On Monday, Nasser Kanaani, a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, warned of “dangerous consequences” following Israel’s strikes. Israel has already seriously degraded the militant group over the last week, the first official said, killing several senior commanders and significantly impacting Hezbollah’s command and control structure, multiple officials said. “They’ve probably been taken 20 years backwards,” another official said of the combined effects of Israel’s operations against Hezbollah. The Pentagon announced Monday that the US is deploying more troops to the Middle East “out of an abundance of caution” as tensions have continued to rise in the region. The crisis increases the stakes of President Joe Biden’s speech to General Assembly on Tuesday, but expectations he can ratchet down tensions are likely to be low, especially considering the US efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have floundered. Allies scrambling for ‘concrete ideas’ Allies at the global gathering in New York are scrambling to come up with “concrete ideas” to de-escalate the situation that threatens to destabilize the region. The senior State Department official did not say if the US expects Israel to carry out a ground incursion in Lebanon if those de-escalation efforts fail but noted that it is “important for everyone to take Israeli preparations seriously.” “I would not infer from the pace or intensity of Israeli strikes on a given day, the success or failure of our efforts to get them to act with a degree of restraint,” the State Department official added. On Monday, Israel carried out strikes against 1,600 Hezbollah targets, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said, going after long-range cruise missiles and heavy rockets capable of hitting deep within Israel. Hagari said the weapons were hidden “at the heart of the villages, within civilian homes.” The massive aerial bombardment left at least 492 dead in Lebanon, according to the country’s health ministry, including 35 children and 58 women. At least 1,645 people were injured, the ministry said. The single-day death toll made it the deadliest 24 hours of conflict in the country since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The IDF said Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets toward Israel on Monday, some of which were intercepted over Haifa, the third largest city in the country and the largest city in northern Israel. Israel has told the US that a full-scale war is not the intent of its strikes, according to an Israeli official. Instead, Israel’s goal is to return 70,000 citizens, displaced since Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones on October 8, to their homes near the border with Lebanon. The goal is a diplomatic solution through escalation, the Israeli official said. But the IDF would not rule out the possibility of a ground incursion, an enormous operation that would likely require the call up a significant number of reserves and the relocation of Israeli forces to the border with Lebanon. “Is the army prepared?” Hagari asked rhetorically at a press briefing Monday. “Yes, the army is in full readiness and we will do whatever is necessary to bring back home all our citizens to the northern border safely.” The operation which caused the pagers and walkie-talkies to explode, carried out by the Mossad and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), rattled Hezbollah’s ability to communicate, officials said, especially after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah urged the militant organization in February to avoid cell phones. But even after suffering a major blow, Hezbollah remains a more formidable foe to Israel than Hamas in Gaza, with a pre-war arsenal estimated at 150,000 rockets and missiles, a stockpile built and improved with the help of Iran. Israel’s cabinet declared a “special situation” across the entire country, allowing it to impose drastic restrictions on civilian life. Those restrictions, including school closures and limits on public gatherings, are currently limited to northern Israel and near Gaza. In a sign of how seriously the government views the situation, hospitals in northern Israel were ordered to move their patients to fortified areas. Meanwhile, officials are waiting to see how Iran will react. Tehran is yet to respond militarily to the July assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian promised Monday that his country would still seek revenge. “Ismail Haniyeh was our guest. It was the day that I became the president,” Pezeshkian said at the UN. “Israel came and hit and made him a so-called martyr in order to expand the war in the region and create instability in the region.”"

As he prepares for his final high-profile speech at the United Nations on Tuesday , the crisis is overshadowing any attempt at burnishing his foreign policy legacy. Without any near-term hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza, Biden is facing new questions about his approach to the nearly year-long conflict. White House officials watched with concern over the weekend as Israeli warplanes struck targets in Lebanon while Hezbollah fired rockets and drones into northern Israel. As Biden was meeting Asia-Pacific leaders in Delaware, the crisis was unfolding in a different part of the world. The president and his aides were closely monitoring the situation from Wilmington. Biden’s aides currently view the risk of escalation as serious and real, and have been communicating on a daily basis with officials in Israel, officials said Monday. “The risk of escalation is real; it has been since October 7. There are moments where it is more acute than others. I think we are in one of those moments where it is more acute,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Speaking Sunday, Biden said he was concerned about escalation in the Middle East. But he reaffirmed his view that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas – which American officials believe would lower temperatures across the region – was still possible. “We’re going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we’re still pushing hard,” he told reporters at the White House His optimism masked fading hopes among administration officials that a deal can be reached before Biden leaves office. The president and his top national security officials have spent the past year working to prevent the war in Gaza from spreading to a wider regional conflict, with the northern front with Lebanon their chief concern. Amos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser, has spent the past several months working to prevent a second front from opening in the north, including a trip just last week meant to head off a wider escalation in the long-simmering tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Yet there have been no high-level phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Biden is not currently scheduled to met the Israeli leader when he’s in the United States at the end of this week. Sullivan told reporters on Saturday that while the risk of escalation was “acute,” there remained avenues to ease tensions. “We actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure, and we’re going to do everything that we can to bring that about,” he said. As world leaders gather in New York for the general assembly this week, some US officials are concerned that the global gathering could further enflame mounting tensions in the Middle East, two US officials said. The concern is concentrated on what countries around the world might say about the conflict while the entire world is watching, even as the US officials have been urging de-escalation for months and have reiterated that call in recent days. Typically US officials view UNGA as an opportunity to galvanize the world behind a major US push – such as supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggressions in recent years – making the anxiety that US officials are feeling this year unique. US officials are particularly bracing for the possibility of new countries recognizing Palestine as a state. Even if new countries are not added to the effort to recognize Palestine, they are watching for what the countries say that have already made the move earlier this year, such as US allies Norway, Spain and Ireland. The US will also have eyes on the speech by the leader of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, and a possible speech by Netanyahu if he attends the gathering, which is a question that remains in the air.

It’s a risky approach that could backfire long-term.","Sep 23, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Nick Paton Walsh,Middle East,"CNN — Wars of peace are rarely successful. They are normally of choice: pre-emptively attacking to neutralize a perceived threat. Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck in the tit-for-tat horror of escalation chicken for nearly a year. But over the past week Israel has clearly decided to massively amplify its attacks on the Iran-backed militant group, claiming, according to some reports, they seek to “escalate to deescalate” – to cow their adversary into a diplomatic solution. It is a highly risky and likely flawed mantra, perhaps designed to dupe their frustrated ally, the United States, into believing that the diplomatic solution, which Washington has now sunk an almost embarrassing amount of energy into, is still also Israel’s goal. But the greater the harm inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the more likely a shorter-term Israeli success has seemed. A full-scale ground war between a tired, divided Israeli military and an experienced, angry Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon would likely be disastrous for Israel. It is exactly what the militant group is good at and waiting for. Yet it is also something Israel does not for now need to get into. The past week has shown the technological chasm between the two adversaries. One must resort to technology from two decades ago to evade Israeli spyware and surveillance. The other is able to infiltrate the limited supply chain of that very device – thousands of pagers of Taiwanese design – and implant explosives that maim hundreds of senior Hezbollah operatives simultaneously, while also killing children and wounding thousands of others. Were that brutally clinical assault not enough, 24 hours later they killed yet more militants by detonating a series of walkie-talkie bombs , even at funerals for those assassinated the day before. In the ensuing panic, Israel appears able to have spotted Hezbollah members making enough mistakes that over a dozen senior figures, and a very senior commander, Ibrahim Aqil, were assassinated at the same time in a huge blast in southern Beirut Friday. And throughout it all, Hezbollah positions were hit in the south of Lebanon by repeated airstrikes. There has been significant damage to command, control, morale and equipment, all without a single Israeli boot on the ground. It is important to not dismiss the psychological and operational impact of an attack such as the pager onslaught would have on any adversary. Hezbollah members likely don’t know who in their number is left to contact or how; they will scatter; they will seek a direction; they will perhaps fail to settle on a unified response; they may even waste a little time in succession infighting. In time, they may rise and strike back harshly, but for now Israel is exploiting the initial chaos ruthlessly.

Shir Torem/Reuters Related article Hezbollah fires rockets deep into northern Israel as tensions flare. Here’s what we know Where does the “de-escalation” fit in? The Israeli hope is presumably that Hezbollah feels so damaged, and so greatly fears further damage to Lebanon’s civilians, that it agrees to withdraw to the north of the Litani River, and bow to its adversary’s demands in such a way that Israeli civilians are allowed to return home in the north of their country. It would be tough for Hassan Nasrallah – Hezbollah’s measured and focused leader who also pushed his men towards pagers from smartphones – to project weakness like that after the past week. He may be able to sell such a strategy out of necessity as one of strategic patience – to suggest this is their only choice to save Lebanon and they may later live to fight another day – but it would be tough. The Israelis, who seem to have thoroughly penetrated Hezbollah’s communications, likely have a better handle on the militant’s internal deliberations than they state in public. They may have assessed Nasrallah must eventually back down, as his organization has been exposed as weakened after expending so many experienced fighters in Syria’s civil war. Conversely, they might have calculated that Nasrallah truly is backed into a corner, and will have to lash out with a sustained rocket barrage against Israeli towns. That would leave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if a larger conflagration begins, with the unconvincing, binary justification of: “They started it.” Emergency workers use excavators to clear the rubble at the site of Friday's Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs, Lebanon on Monday, September 23. Hassan Ammar/AP Militarily, the past week has been a disaster for Hezbollah. It risks comparison to the moment Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 – when a revered monolith was exposed as neither that modern or potent at all. On the evidence of Hezbollah’s remarkable vulnerabilities in recent days, Israel may feel confident it can continue to hit them hard – that its foe is not really able to strike back meaningfully. Hezbollah can fire better rockets, for sure, but many are intercepted, and they do not have an inexhaustible supply . Does Nasrallah think this is the moment to fire his one big barrage? Or would his allies in Iran prefer him to wait for another time? If Hezbollah withdraws voluntarily – or refuses to, and the violence continues – Israel can still hit target after target with a superior air force, with apparently little concern, for now, that Hezbollah can exact too great a price on its own population centers. Israel has shown in Gaza its disregard for civilian collateral damage. The impact any increased violence is having on ordinary Lebanese will be a double-edged sword: it will extenuate the already advanced hatred for their southern neighbor, but also foment enmity towards the damage and chaos Hezbollah’s attacks have brought to Lebanon. Perhaps Netanyahu – who appears to have set on military solutions alone over the past year, perhaps for reasons of his own personal political furtherance – thinks he can bomb Hezbollah into irrelevance. Israel may, possibly, inflict so much damage it inflicts a qualitative change as to what Hezbollah can do. But wars never just stop there. Hezbollah will rebuild, as its cause is based on a specific place and people – Lebanon and its Shia. The lesson NATO slowly learned in Afghanistan would be wisely heeded here – that killing endless mid-level commanders in hourly night raids leaves you instead with only their angry, radicalized sons left to talk to when you want to negotiate. Israel is flaunting its wizardry in warfare, and able to exact vicious costs as it turns a blind eye to civilian casualties. Yet exactly what road ahead it sees is unclear. It may matter less to Netanyahu’s war cabinet if Hezbollah chooses to retreat or is bombed into it. But the lesson of violence in this region is it has a habit of echoing, often in unexpected and more savage ways, back on its perpetrators in the decades ahead."

On Saturday, Israel pounded Hezbollah targets with nearly 300 strikes in what they described as preemptive action to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah meanwhile has been launching a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel in what it says is retaliation for Israeli attacks in Lebanon. Hezbollah – the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group – has been left reeling after two days of blasts targeting pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members was followed by an Israeli strike on southern Beirut, which killed at least 45 people including a top commander and other senior operatives. Here’s what we know about the escalation of tensions. What’s happened, when and where? On Tuesday and Wednesday, Lebanon was rocked by two similar, surprise attacks . On Tuesday afternoon, pagers exploded at the same time across several parts of Lebanon, including capital Beirut, and in several towns in the central Beqaa valley, strongholds for the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Almost exactly 24 hours later, Lebanon was rocked by a second attack Wednesday, when walkie-talkies detonated in the suburbs of Beirut and in the south of the country. Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad put the death toll from both attacks at 39; 12 on Tuesday and 27 on Wednesday. The exploding devices attacks were followed by an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Friday, which killed at least 45 including senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil, and levelled a multistory building in a densely populated neighborhood.

Bilal Hussein/AP Related article A limited confrontation with Israel is extracting a seemingly unlimited price from Hezbollah The developments put the region on a knife edge, with Hezbollah targeting northern Israel with a series of rockets and missiles overnight on Saturday into Sunday, striking deeper into Israeli territory than they have done in other recent attacks. The attacks, Hezbollah said, were in response to repeated Israeli strikes in Lebanon that have led to the deaths of “many civilians.” Among the targets, Hezbollah said it hit an air base with Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, a longer-range weapon seemingly not used so far. Most were intercepted but some fell, causing damage. The Israeli military reported impacts in Kiryat Bialik, Tsur Shalom and Moreshet near the port city of Haifa, around 40 km (25 miles) south of the border, marking one of the deepest direct hits by the Iran-backed group since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. Schools have closed in many northern areas of Israel, and gatherings have been restricted. Israel meanwhile fired nearly 300 projectiles into southern Lebanon on Saturday in what the military said was pre-emptive action against a planned Hezbollah attack. Israel continued its strikes into Sunday, with Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reporting two people were killed Sunday morning in southern Lebanon. Will the conflict escalate? Exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have occurred consistently since the outbreak of war in Gaza on October 8, the day after Hamas’ attack on Israel, in skirmishes which have long sparked fears of the fighting spilling over into a wider regional conflict. Key players have at times appeared to walk right up to the brink , but tensions have de-escalated given the grave consequences of an all-out war in the Middle East. However, the intensity of attacks between Israel and Hezbollah seen over the past few days has been unprecedented, renewing fears of a wider war that could drag in the entire region, as well as Israel’s chief ally the United States. Emergency workers use excavators to clear the rubble at the site of Friday's Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs. Bilal Hussein/AP While Hezbollah’s leader has previously stated he does not want a fully-fledged regional war, experts have said he may now be under more pressure to act following the spate of explosions, and with Israel set on moving its military objectives to its northern border. CNN Related article Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide Israeli President Israel Herzog told Sky News on Sunday said that Israel “is not interested to be at war with Lebanon.” He instead blamed Hezbollah for the military escalation between the two nations. Hezbollah has admitted the attacks have left them weakened but also show little sign of pulling back. Naim Qassim – the group’s second most important figure after leader Hassan Nasrallah – said a “a battle without limits” was now underway. Why did Israel target Lebanon now? Hezbollah and Israel have been in conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October when the war in Gaza began, following Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel. Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the Middle East spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 11 months. The axis has said they will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader. Israel may have chosen this timing for the attacks because it believed Hezbollah had discovered the pagers’ capability – making it a “use it or lose it” moment, said an Israeli source familiar with national security. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also have wanted to shore up domestic support. Officials and residents from the northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes after being evacuated due to attacks, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border – which has long been understood to be a political necessity. Speaking on Sunday, Netanyahu again put the focus on ensuring the return of Israel citizens to their homes in northern Israel and to restore security in that region. Speaking ahead of a government meeting, he said: “If Hezbollah didn’t get the message - I assure you - they will get the message. We are determined to return our citizens in the north to their homes safely.” CNN’s Tamara Qiblawi, Tim Lister, Mick Krever, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Eyad Kourdi, Jessie Yeung, Hamdi Alkhshali and Lauren Izso contributed reporting."

It is unclear how many Palestinians remain north of the so-called Netzarim Corridor , which splits Gaza in two, but estimates run into the hundreds of thousands. The plan does not mention whether, when, or how civilians would be allowed to return to northern Gaza. After nearly a year of war, with no part of Gaza immune from Israeli airstrikes, Palestinians have been increasingly unwilling to heed Israeli demands to relocate. The idea comes from a group of retired Israeli military generals, who have formally presented it to the Israeli cabinet and a powerful parliamentary committee. The goal, they say, is to use siege tactics to starve Hamas fighters and force them to release 101 hostages still held in the territory. Eden Yerushalmi Hostages and Missing Families Forum Related article Slain Israeli hostage held by Hamas in ‘inhuman’ conditions underneath Gaza, sisters tell CNN “Those who leave will receive food and water,” Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli military general who is spearheading the proposal, says in a slickly produced video posted online earlier this month. “But in a week the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory, and this military territory as far as we are concerned, no supplies will enter it.” Israeli national broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate, reported on Sunday that Netanyahu, in a closed-door meeting with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said that the plan “makes a lot of sense.” “It is one of the plans being considered, but there are several others,” he said, according to Kan. “We are committed to dismantling the civilian control of Hamas.” It is unclear when the meeting took place. An Israeli official confirmed the veracity of that quote, but said, “seeing it positively does not mean adopting it.” The official said that the head of the Israel Defense Forces’ strategic division will in the coming days present to Netanyahu “several alternatives” for how to “deprive Hamas of civilian control capabilities in Gaza.” Video Ad Feedback Sisters of slain Israeli hostage: ‘They starved her before they murdered her’ 03:35 - Source: CNN Calls to adopt plan In a letter obtained by CNN, 27 members of Knesset – including three sitting ministers – have written to the government urging them to adopt it. The public face of the proposal is Eiland, who had an illustrious career rising to the rank of major general and serving as head of the prime minister’s National Security Council from 2004 to 2006. “The reality today in Gaza is that Sinwar is really not stressed,” he says in the video. “The right thing to do is to inform the approximately 300,000 residents who remained in the northern Gaza Strip, citizen residents, of the following: Not that we are suggesting you leave the northern Gaza Strip, we are ordering you to leave the northern Gaza Strip.” “In a week, the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory. And this military territory, as far as we are concerned, no supplies will enter it. That is why 5,000 terrorists who are in this situation, they can either surrender or starve.” “Dictators like Sinwar are not afraid of military pressure. They are afraid of two other things: a governmental alternative and the existence of an angry mob that can overthrow them.” The Commanders and Reserve Fighters Forum, a group of retired and reservist commanders, has championed the plan “to bring about a de facto change in the war situation.” It is not clear what the senior leadership of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) thinks of the plan. When asked for comment on the proposal, the IDF referred CNN to the Prime Minister’s Office. The plan does not tackle the question of whether Palestinians could ever return to northern Gaza, one of its backers told CNN. Video Ad Feedback Hear from children living in makeshift homes on the shores of Gaza 01:47 - Source: CNN “It will all depend on what will happen in the future,” Retired Major-General Gershon Hacohen said in a text message. “But there is no indication in the plan that they will never be able to go back.” The generals’ group claims to have presented the plan to the Israeli cabinet “several times.” The Prime Minister’s Office would not confirm to CNN whether those meetings took place. The plan has been presented to the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Meirav Cohen, a member of Knesset from the centrist Yesh Atid party, lambasted the government for allowing aid trucks into Gaza. “The only threat that they are facing is obesity,” she said during a meeting with the pressure group, including Giora Eiland. “Is this how we will bring our hostages back home? So I think that the plan that Giora and other commanders presented here is very smart. It sets clear rules. We have to implement it.” In the letter addressed to Netanyahu and his fellow ministers, 27 of the 120 members of Knesset lament that “we have not yet reached the finish line in any of the goals defined by the War Cabinet.” They call on the government to implement Eiland’s plan in northern Gaza. “After carrying out the program in this area, it is possible to carry it out in other parts of the strip,” they say."

A spokesman for the Gaza Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal, said the missile hit the Al-Zaytoun School, near Gaza City, where thousands were sheltering. The Government Media Office in Gaza said 13 children, including a 3-month-old infant were killed. Other children needed amputations, the GMO said. The Israeli military said that the compound was being used as a Hamas command center and precautions had been taken to avoid civilian casualties. Aircraft “conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a Hamas command and control center in Gaza City” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. “The command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served as the Al Falah School, was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and carry out terrorist attacks.” CNN is unable to verify whether Hamas operatives were present at the compound.

We were sitting in the schools, and suddenly missiles started raining down on us. There was no warning. Where is the conscience?” The woman, who did not give her name, added: “My message is that this war and the bloodshed should make you wake up. All of you are numb and don’t feel anything … No schools, no hospitals, no food, no water. Shame on you.” A girl who said her name was Amal, and was also sheltering at the school, asked: “What have we, the children, done to wake up and go to sleep in fear? At least stop the bombing of schools. We have no schools, no homes — where should we go? “Everyone was martyred, all of them were martyred, torn to pieces,” she said. “The Arab countries are afraid and don’t want to intervene — why are you scared? What is our fault? Call for a truce and end this. What’s wrong with you?” asked Amal. Amid a flare-up in tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Israel continues to operate in Gaza where it is seeking to destroy Hamas following the October 7 attacks, claiming the killing of a prominent Hamas operative and several other fighters. The IDF also said Saturday that troops had recently detected “armed militants” robbing a humanitarian aid truck in the Rafah area, without giving a date. While securing the humanitarian route, the IDF said, “troops identified armed militants robbing a humanitarian aid truck. In a swift operation, the troops directed drones that located the militants fleeing in a car, and they were eliminated by IAF aircraft.” The security of humanitarian convoys has been an issue for aid agencies, with looting a frequent problem.

Ibrahim Aqil, part of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, was assassinated along with several other commanders, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, accusing them of planning to raid and occupy communities in Galilee in northern Israel. Hezbollah confirmed Aqil’s death, saying he was killed “following a treacherous Israeli assassination operation.” Aqil had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States for his suspected involvement in the 1983 strike on the US Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, as well as the bombing of the Beirut Marine barracks, which killed 241 US personnel later that year. According to Hagari, the targeted commanders were “underground underneath a residential building in the heart of the Dahiyeh neighborhood, using civilians as a human shield” at the time of the attack. In total, Hezbollah confirmed the deaths of at least 16 of its operatives in the strike, which flattened a multistory residential building and was the deadliest strike between Israel and Lebanon since the October 7 attacks. The Lebanese health minister, Firass Abiad, said at a news conference Saturday that among the 31 dead are three children and seven women. Three Syrian citizens were killed, he said, and 68 people wounded. Rescue teams were still clearing the rubble Saturday, Abiad said, and searching for missing people. They had retrieved body parts that are unidentifiable. A week of surprise attacks Friday’s strike marked the fourth consecutive day of surprise attacks on Beirut and other sites across the country, even as Israeli forces continued deadly strikes and operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The first major attack against Hezbollah this week came Tuesday afternoon when pagers belonging to the militant groups’ members exploded near-simultaneously. The pagers had been used by Hezbollah to communicate after the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, encouraged members to switch to low-tech devices to prevent more of them from being assassinated. Almost exactly 24 hours later, Lebanon was rocked by a second wave of explosions, after Hezbollah walkie-talkies detonated in Beirut and the south of the country on Wednesday. Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad on Saturday said at least 39 people were killed in those twin attacks; 12 on Tuesday and 27 on Wednesday. Some 3,000 were injured. In a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, UN human rights chief Volker Türk on Friday warned that the detonation of communication devices could violate international human rights law. Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib and Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon clashed at the heated meeting, with Bou Habib calling on the council to condemn Israel’s actions and Danon slamming the Lebanese envoy for not mentioning Hezbollah. A photo taken in southern Beirut shows the remains of an exploded pager on Tuesday. AFP/Getty Images Israel initially refused to comment on Tuesday’s pager explosions, but on Wednesday tacitly acknowledged its role in the attacks. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant praised the “excellent achievements” of the IDF, together with the country’s security agency, the Shin Bet, and its intelligence agency Mossad. Gallant said a “new era” of war was beginning, and on Thursday Israel targeted Beirut for a third time, flying jets and dropping flares over the city while Nasrallah made a speech in which he pledged Israel would face a “reckoning.” Later, Israel launched one of its most intense bombardments against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in nearly a year of cross–border strikes, saying it hit about 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers. Friday’s airstrike was the third Israeli airstrike on Beirut since hostilities began last year, after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. In January, an Israeli airstrike killed Saleh Al-Arouri , deputy head of Hamas’ military wing, who had been living in Beirut. In July, a second Israeli strike on Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr . Several other Iran-backed militant groups, including the powerful Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba in Iraq have vowed revenge for Israel’s attack on southern Beirut. The groups have carried out several attacks against US forces in Iraq and Israel since Israel’s war with Hamas started. Ibrahim Aqil, pictured here on a wanted poster, had a $7 million bounty on his head from the United States.

After nearly a year of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes both in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. While the return of residents of northern Israel has long been understood to be a political necessity for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal.

Eden Yerushalmi was taken from the Nova music festival when Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel, and her body was among six recovered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late last month. Her sisters Shani and May told CNN’s Anderson Cooper they had received proof that she was alive on three occasions, including just three weeks before her death. “It’s very difficult for us. We feel like we’re in a nightmare,” Shani Yerushalmi said. “Sometimes it feels like it isn’t real, like it’s not happening to us, because the whole time we truly believed that Eden would come back home alive.” Yerushalmi’s family have learned details of her captivity from the IDF since her body was returned to Israel from Gaza. Describing the tunnel in which she was kept for several weeks, Shani said: “They barely could stand fully … they couldn’t sleep next to each other, only in a line. There were no windows, no air, no light. Barely food, and if they needed to go to the bathroom they were forced to do it in a bucket.” The IDF said the group’s bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The IDF told the family her sister was “shot in the head from very close range,” and had marks on her hands from defending herself, May told CNN. Yerushalmi’s death, along with five other Israeli captives, ignited fresh rage in the country , much of it directed at the handling of the crisis by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Netanyahu has been under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire-for-hostages deal that would secure the return of more than 100 people still held in the enclave. “In that specific tunnel we know that they were a few weeks, which is horrible. I don’t know if I could be in there a day,” Shani told CNN. Yerushalmi, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Carmel Gat, was slated to be released as part of the “humanitarian category” based on a framework deal Israel and Hamas agreed to in early July, two Israeli officials told CNN after the recovery of their bodies, with one of them adding : “Our prime minister delayed it.” The 23-year-old from Tel Aviv was a pilates instructor and working as a bartender at the Nova music festival on October 7. When sirens sounded, Yerushalmi sent a video of rocket fire to her family group chat, saying she was leaving the festival, according to the Hostages Families Forum. For four hours, she spoke with her two sisters, May and Shani, who heard everything she went through as she tried to escape. Her last words were: “They’ve caught me.” May, who chose to see Yerushalmi’s body after its return to Israel, told CNN: “We gave her a last hug to say goodbye to her. She was so thin, we could feel her bones sticking out.” Her autopsy later showed she was just 79 pounds when she died. The sisters described Yerushalmi as a friendly and warm person, with May saying: “The most important thing is that she was a hero, and she survived 11 months in those tunnels.”"

Focus is now on what Hezbollah and Israel’s next moves will be, with the United Nations Security Council due to hold an emergency meeting Friday to discuss the situation. Uncertainty remains over whether Israel’s attacks are a precursor to a ground invasion across its northern border into Lebanon and to what extent Iran-backed Hezbollah, one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the region, is capable of responding even as its leader vowed that a “reckoning will come.” Here’s what we know. What’s the fallout? In Lebanon, fear and panic have gripped residents as the attacks upended daily life to deadly and gruesome effect. A surgeon told CNN there is a long road to recovery for many of those maimed or in critical condition after wireless devices exploded in their pockets or faces. At least 37 people were killed in the attacks Tuesday and Wednesday, including children, and nearly 3,000 injured. Hezbollah said at least 38 of its members have been killed since Tuesday afternoon, but didn’t provide further details. In a speech Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned the twin attacks, calling them “massacres” that “crossed all the red lines” because the devices exploded in public areas, with civilians among those harmed. Though Hezbollah “suffered a major blow,” a “reckoning will come,” he added, and vowed the attacks would not bring the group down. The Hezbollah chief also warned Israel that fighting on the Lebanese front will not stop until hostilities end in Gaza .

Hours later, Israel launched a barrage of strikes in Lebanon, saying it hit about 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and “terrorist infrastructure sites.” Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it launched at least 17 attacks on military sites in northern Israel. Israel has signaled its readiness for war with Hezbollah. The Israeli defense minister’s warning on Wednesday that a “new era” of war was beginning was followed by the military confirming its top commander had “completed approval of plans for the northern arena” along the Lebanon border.

Hezbollah leader Nasrallah hinted at retaliation for the twin attacks but it’s unclear what capacity the group might have to launch a counterattack if many of its members are wounded, and key communication methods are no longer reliable. Despite Hezbollah appearing weakened, it is still believed to be the most heavily armed non-state group in the world with an increasingly sophisticated arsenal that has the potential to inflict significant damage on Israel. There are however signs the already secretive group may have been driven deeper underground. The usual public gathering – typically consisting of high-level party officials and supporters – to watch Nasrallah’s speech was absent on Thursday. And Nasrallah’s address – his first since the two waves of attacks – was possibly pre-recorded.

Lebanon-based Hezbollah is part of a Tehran-led axis spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 11 months. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami reportedly told Nasrallah that Israel “will soon” face “a decisive and crushing response from (the) axis of resistance.” The group also has a history of targeting Israel overseas, including a 1992 bomb attack at the Israeli embassy in Argentina that killed 29 people, and attacks on Israeli diplomats in India, Georgia and Thailand in 2012 that Israel blamed on Iran and Hezbollah , though the group denied involvement at the time.

Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Haven’t we been here before? Fears that Israel’s devastating war in Gaza could spill into a wider regional conflict have flared to varying degrees of alarm since Hamas launched its deadly October 7 killing and kidnapping rampage. Key players have at times appeared to walk right up to the brink , but tensions have de-escalated given the grave consequences of an all-out war in the Middle East. But almost every week brings another violent incident that sets the region on high alert once again, with fears that an all out war would drag in the entire region, as well as Israel’s chief ally the United States.

Alexander sat down with Tapper along with other family members of Americans being held by the terror group on Wednesday as the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s brutal October 7 attack approaches. As it stands the prospects of a deal being agreed that would free the hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza seem remote. Instead, the conflict appears to be spreading. On Thursday Israel launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and on Wednesday Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated  a “new era” of war is beginning. On the ceasefire negotiations, Alexander called for President Joe Biden to “have a tight conversation” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him to “stop moving the goalposts and stop undercutting your own negotiating team.” “This conversation needs to happen as soon as possible,” he added. Netanyahu is scheduled to be in New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly, but a source told CNN that he will not meet with Biden. Biden has previously suggested that Netanyahu is drawing out the conflict for the sake of his own political survival. Iris Weinstein Haggai, whose parents were killed on October 7, said the US government needs to do more. “It’s just unacceptable that we’re not doing all we can to push all countries and [the] international community to pressure Hamas and release these innocent hostages who are rotting,” Weinstein Haggai said. Several of the hostage families are in Washington this week, just under three weeks from the anniversary of the October 7 attacks. The families met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday, where they “expressed frustration with the lack of tangible progress” in ceasefire talks, according to a readout of their meeting. Their visit comes weeks after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, from Hamas-controlled tunnels in Gaza. Days before Goldberg-Polin’s death was confirmed, his parents made a plea for their son’s return at the Democratic National Convention. Ronen Neutra, the father of Omer Neutra, said on Wednesday he was “horrified” by Goldberg-Polin’s death. “Where is the outrage? How can it be that an American was murdered, and yet people are in the streets in New York cheering for Hamas? It’s the same organization (that) just killed an American,” he said. “So in that regard, where is the outrage? “As far as Prime Minister Netanyahu? I don’t think I have much expectations from him I’m afraid,” Neutra added. “What he says out of Israel in front of the American public and what he says in Israel that those two don’t correlate.” Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of another American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said his expectations for a breakthrough in negotiations “are low.” “All Israelis are done listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu because clearly there’s a gap between what he says in terms of his commitment to getting the hostages home and his actions,” Dekel-Chen added. “It’s clear to me, at least that he’s coming to the United Nations certainly for domestic consumption in Israel,” he said. “What he says there, I’m not sure that anyone is going to be listening unfortunately in the General Assembly.” “It’s just unacceptable that we’re not doing all we can to push all countries and [the] international community to pressure Hamas and release these innocent hostages who are rotting,” he said.

The proposal from Gal Hirsch, a close Netanyahu ally who serves as Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, would see a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza , the release in one stage of all hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the safe passage for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to be exiled out of Gaza, according to Kan 11, an Israeli national broadcaster and CNN affiliate. Reactions to the proposal have widely been that it will be a non-starter for Hamas, which has not commented on it. President Joe Biden announces a proposed ceasefire between Israel and Hamas while delivering remarks at the White House on May 31, 2024. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Related article Biden’s national security team has no imminent plans to present an updated ceasefire proposal It is unclear whether the proposal addresses the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza after a ceasefire and hostage deal – a key sticking point in stalled negotiations. And the idea that Sinwar would leave Gaza is seen as unlikely by American officials. A separate Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said the proposal was not being discussed among the Israeli negotiating team as a basis for new negotiations with Hamas, which have been at a standstill for weeks now. The Hostages Families Forum initially praised the outline, but later on Thursday called it a “cynical and cheap manipulation.” “This is fraud whose purpose is to thwart the new American initiative to release the hostages and stop the war in Gaza,” the organization said. “Soon we will celebrate a year of abandonment. This is a moral and value bankruptcy that the state has never seen before.” Talks stall The proposal comes at a time when the prospects for a deal have never been lower. The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have expressed dismay at escalating tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying that a widescale war there would only lower the chances of a hostage deal. Joe Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present the US president with an updated proposal in the Israel-Hamas war ceasefire negotiations, two senior administration officials told CNN – the latest indication that talks to end the conflict have seriously stalled. Netanyahu will not meet with Biden during his visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly next week, an Israel source familiar with the matter told CNN. Hirsch met early last week with Roger Carstens, the US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, to discuss negotiations to free the hostages held in Gaza. The notion of facilitating Sinwar’s exile has been discussed at various points in the negotiations as part of the later stages of an eventual ceasefire agreement, although there is no indication that Sinwar would agree to such terms. Gershon Baskin, who has extensive experience negotiating with Hamas, told CNN that anyone who thought Sinwar would leave Gaza “does not live in this world.” “Gaza is Sinwar’s sea and he is a fish. A fish does not come out of the sea willingly.” Nonetheless, if the agreement included the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, it would come “close to a deal that Hamas is ready for,” Baskin added. Previously, when the idea was raised of allowing top Hamas leaders like Sinwar to leave Gaza as part of a ceasefire agreement, American officials said they thought it was unlikely Sinwar would agree. They cited Israel’s assassinations of Hamas leaders in foreign capitals, and said they believed Sinwar would prefer to die fighting Israel than to leave Gaza. “I even believe that we will agree to build safe passage to the chief terrorist, the new Hitler, Sinwar – safe passage to him and whoever he wants to join him out of Gaza,” Hirsch told CNN earlier this month.

Here’s what we know,"Lebanon is reeling after facing deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members – with pagers simultaneously exploding across the country on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion on Wednesday.","Sep 19, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Jessie Yeung,Middle East,"CNN — Lebanon is reeling after facing deadly back-to-back attacks targeting Hezbollah members – with pagers simultaneously exploding across the country on Tuesday, then walkie-talkies detonating in a similar fashion on Wednesday. Panic, fear and grief have now gripped the country, with questions swirling about how the attacks could have been carried out, where the devices came from, and whether this latest development could plunge the Middle East into a wider regional conflict. At least 37 people, including children, have been killed in the attacks, which Lebanese officials have blamed on Israel . Thousands more are injured – many maimed and in critical condition after communications devices exploded in their pockets or in their face. After warning Wednesday that a “new era” of war was beginning, Israel on Thursday began to strike targets in Lebanon and says its top commander has approved plans “for the northern arena.” Here’s what we know so far. What happened, when and where? The first attack came on Tuesday afternoon when pagers exploded at the same time across several parts of Lebanon – including the capital Beirut, and in several towns in the central Beqaa valley, strongholds for the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Videos showed the bloody aftermath on streets and public spaces. In one CCTV video, a man was picking out fruit in a supermarket when an explosion detonated – leaving him groaning in pain on the ground, clutching his lower abdomen as panic breaks out around him. Lebanese hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, with limited staff attending to hundreds of bandaged and bleeding patients – some of whom had to lie on the floor as more of the injured arrived. Almost exactly 24 hours later, Lebanon was rocked by a second attack Wednesday, when walkie-talkies detonated in the suburbs of Beirut and in the south of the country. One witness, who cannot be named for security reasons, described seeing a man’s hands blown off by an exploding walkie-talkie while attending a Hezbollah funeral. Fires broke out in dozens of homes, stores, and vehicles, with videos showing smoke billowing on chaotic streets. In a speech on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah conceded the group had suffered an “unprecedented” blow. He said the twin attacks had “crossed all red lines” and pledged there would be a “reckoning.” While Nasrallah was speaking, CNN reporters in the country heard a sonic boom as an Israeli military jet flew over Beirut and dropped what appeared to be flares over the city. Minutes later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it was striking targets to “degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure.” Firefighters put out flames and a crowd gathers after a reported explosion in Saida, Lebanon, on September 18, 2024. Mahmoud Zayat/AFP/Getty Images Why would Israel target Lebanon now? Hezbollah and Israel have been at conflict for decades – but the two have ramped up their cross-border attacks on each other since last October when the war in Gaza began, following Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel. Hezbollah is part of a larger Iran-led axis across the Middle East spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has engaged in a simmering conflict with Israel and its allies over the past 11 months. The axis has said they will continue striking Israeli targets as long as the war in Gaza goes on, rebranding themselves as a “supportive front” for Palestinians in the strip, as described by a senior Hezbollah leader. Israel may have chosen this timing for the attacks because it believed Hezbollah had discovered the pagers’ capability – making it a “use it or lose it” moment, said an Israeli source familiar with national security. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also have wanted to shore up domestic support. Officials and residents from the northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes after being evacuated due to attacks, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, Israel made it a new war objective to return Israel’s northern residents to their homes near the border – which has long been understood to be a political necessity. People gather outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which saw an influx of injured patients after explosions in Lebanon's capital on September 17. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters How did it happen? There are still many questions on how Israel might have carried out its attacks this week – and where the devices that detonated came from. Hezbollah is highly secretive, and its leader has previously urged families to dump their cell phones to avoid infiltration from Israeli and US spyware. That’s why so many Hezbollah members and their families rely instead on low-tech wireless communication devices like pagers. The pagers that exploded were new and had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, a Lebanese security source told CNN. The New York Times reported that Israel planted explosives next to the battery in each pager, as well as a switch for remote detonation, citing US and other officials. When CNN tried to trace the pagers’ origin, it found a mysterious supply chain that stretched from Asia to Europe. Damaged pagers in Lebanon bore the name of a Taiwanese manufacturer – but the company said the devices were instead made and sold by a Hungarian company in Budapest. Hungarian authorities denied this, however, saying the Budapest firm was a “trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country. CNN has tried to contact the company and its chief executive, but did not receive a response. However, according to NBC News, the chief executive confirmed in a phone call that her company worked with the Taiwanese manufacturer – but denied making the pagers and said she was just “the intermediate.” CNN could not confirm her statement. Making things even stranger, the address for the company’s office is in a residential area – where other people in the building said they hardly saw people coming to work, and that the Budapest company had never physically been to the building. Late Thursday, The New York Times reported that the Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, was in fact part of an Israeli front, citing three intelligence officers briefed on the matter. The firm was one of at least three shell companies created to mask the fact that Israeli intelligence personnel were manufacturing the pagers, the officers told the Times. Meanwhile, Lebanon said the walkie-talkies that exploded were a discontinued model made by Japanese firm ICOM. The devices were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, Lebanese authorities said. ICOM said the model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether the ones used in Lebanon were counterfeit or shipped from its company. A photo taken Wednesday in Beirut shows the remains of an exploded pager. AFP/Getty Images How have Hezbollah, Israel and the world responded? Nasrallah said Israel will face a “reckoning” for its twin “massacres.” The head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, told Nasrallah that Israel will face a “crushing response,” Iran state media IRNA reported. The Lebanese government also condemned the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression” and a violation of their national sovereignty. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN on Wednesday he fears the consecutive attacks in Lebanon signal a move to an “introduction to war,” calling on the United Nations Security Council and the United States to help re-establish peace along the Lebanon-Israel border.

After the IDF strikes began on Thursday, Gallant said : “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price.” It appears US officials were largely in the dark until reports emerged of the explosions, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Israeli officials notified the US that it was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon on Tuesday but did not give any details about what they were planning, the sources said.

Almost exactly 24 hours later, walkie-talkies detonated in a fresh wave of explosions Wednesday across Lebanon, a security source told CNN. The suspected attacks against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah are the latest in a series of covert operations that Israel’s government refuses to acknowledge but which are alleged to have been carried out by Israeli operatives. Munich massacre response CNN video Related video Israel’s history of brazen clandestine missions Israel’s alleged history of planting explosives in telecommunication devices goes back as far as 1972, as part of its revenge for the killing of 11 Israelis, including athletes, at the Munich Olympics, which was carried out by the Palestinian militant group Black September. In response, Israel launched “Operation Wrath of God” and spent years tracking down those involved in the Munich Massacre. Mahmoud Hamshari, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representative in Paris, was among those targeted. Unidentified operatives reported to be linked to Israeli intelligence broke into his home and planted a bomb in his phone, before another person – posing as an Italian journalist – arranged a telephone interview with Hamshari. When he picked up the call and identified himself, the bomb was activated remotely. The ‘engineer’ Tuesday’s attacks reminded many of the 1996 killing of Yahya Ayyash , Hamas’ chief bombmaker known as “the engineer,” responsible for killing dozens of Israelis. Ayyash was killed in Gaza after his cell phone, which had been packed with 50 grams (1.76 ounces) of explosives, blew up near his head. After his killing, dozens of Israelis were killed in four retaliatory suicide bombings. Firefighters try to put out a blaze after an explosion in Saida, southern Lebanon, on Wednesday. Mahmoud Zayat/AFP/Getty Images Iranian nuclear scientists Since 2010, five Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in foreign-linked assassinations, as Israel tries to prevent its greatest adversary from developing nuclear weapons. In August 2015, at the height of the assassinations, then-Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon cryptically told the German magazine Der Spiegel that he could not be held responsible “for the life expectancy of Iranian scientists.” Experts believe Israel and the United States were responsible for deploying the complex computer virus called Stuxnet that destroyed centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. Iranian officials have said they believe the cyberattack, which targeted centrifuges including those at the Natanz and Bushehr nuclear plants, originated in Israel and the United States, but neither country has commented on the malware’s origin. Notably, Stuxnet was one of the first times a cyberattack had a manifestation outside cyberspace, causing the centrifuges to spin out of control unnoticed. The pager attack is seemingly another instance of a cyberattack causing a physical consequence, unlike stealing money from a bank account or taking down a website. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , who was Iran’s chief nuclear scientist, was assassinated east of Tehran in 2020 by a remote-controlled machine gun operating out of a nearby Nissan. Iranian officials said the weapon had used artificial intelligence and facial recognition to detect Fakhrizadeh and open fire, before the car, reportedly packed with explosives, self-destructed. Top Iranian officials blamed Israel for the assassination. Israel did not comment. Military personnel carry Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's flag-draped coffin in Tehran in November 2020. Iranian Defense Ministry/AP Human intelligence While many of these assassinations have a sci-fi aspect, experts stressed that each operation requires high levels of human intelligence that raised questions about the security protocols of Israel’s adversaries. After Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, intelligence analysts stressed that a country or actor would still have had to smuggle in specialist equipment to stage the operation. After this week’s events, some speculated that the explosions could have been caused by an Israeli cybersecurity breach that caused the lithium batteries in the pagers to overheat and detonate. But David Kennedy, a former US National Security Agency intelligence analyst, told CNN the explosions were “too large for this to be a remote and direct hack that would overload the pager and cause a lithium battery explosion.” A person is carried on a stretcher outside American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) as people, including Hezbollah fighters and medics, were wounded and killed when the pagers they use to communicate exploded across Lebanon, according to a security source, in Beirut, Lebanon September 17, 2024. REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Related article Hezbollah’s credibility depends on revenge against Israel. But its weakness has been exposed Kennedy said it was more likely that Israel had human operatives in Hezbollah who were able to intercept the supply chain and tamper with the devices. “The pagers would have been implanted with explosives and likely only to detonate when a certain message was received,” he said. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel had hidden explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah, and that a switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, according to unnamed American and other officials briefed on the operation. In some instances, Israel is thought to have relied on human intelligence assets to assassinate its enemies rather than high-tech operations. In July, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran by an explosive device that had been covertly hidden in the guest house where he was staying, two months before it was detonated, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. However, Iran claimed that Haniyeh’s assassination was carried out by a “short-range projectile,” contradicting the information told to CNN. The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.

Almost exactly 24 hours after explosions targeting the pagers of Hezbollah members killed multiple people, including children, and injured more than 2,800, Lebanon was rocked by more deadly blasts as walkie-talkies detonated in Beirut and the south of the country. At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 injured in Wednesday’s explosions, Lebanon’s health ministry said. After declining to comment on Tuesday’s blasts, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant appeared to reference the attacks during a visit Wednesday to the Ramat-David Air Force base in northern Israel. CNN video Related video ‘This will end up with a regional war,’ warns Lebanese Foreign Minister “We are at the beginning of a new era in this war and we need to adapt ourselves,” Gallant said. He praised the “excellent achievements” of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), together with the country’s security agency, the Shin Bet, and its intelligence agency Mossad. CNN previously reported that Tuesday’s operation was a joint effort between the IDF and Mossad, but Gallant’s comment is the first time an Israeli official has apparently acknowledged Israel’s role in the twin attacks. An Israeli source familiar with national security later told CNN Israel launched the pager attack in a “use it or lose it” moment when it believed Hezbollah discovered the capability. The pager explosions came hours after Israel on Monday voted to add another war objective to its conflict with Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to their homes. After nearly a year of tit-for-tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. While the return of Israeli residents has long been understood to be a political necessity for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal. On Wednesday, Netanyahu reiterated his pledge to “bring back the residents of the north safely to their homes.” A source familiar with the matter told CNN the IDF is moving the elite 98th Division from Gaza to northern Israel. “The center of gravity is moving north,” Gallant said. “The meaning is that we are diverting forces, resources, energy towards the north.” Smoke rises from a mobile shop in Sidon, south of Beirut, on Wednesday. Hassan Hankir/Reuters Fresh wave of strikes Dozens of ambulance crews from the Lebanese Red Cross were working to rescue and evacuate the injured after walkie-talkies exploded across the country Wednesday. A witness who was at a Hezbollah funeral in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Wednesday described the chaos as walkie-talkies appeared to explode at around 5 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET). The witness, who cannot be named for security reasons, told CNN they heard a loud bang followed by screaming. They said the man whose wireless device exploded was covered in blood and his hands had been blown off. Photos meanwhile show﻿ed walkie-talkies that were ripped apart in the explosions. The Lebanese Civil Defense said it was working to put out fires in 60 homes and shops that started after the walkie-talkies exploded, including one in a lithium battery store. Lebanon’s communications ministry said the walkie-talkies were a discontinued model made by Japanese firm ICOM. The IC-V82 devices were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services, the ministry said. ICOM said in a statement Wednesday it was investigating the reports and that the model linked to the explosions was discontinued a decade ago. ICOM added it could not determine whether they were counterfeit or shipped by the company, though its website says all such IC-V82 devices in circulation are counterfeit. Two damaged devices after Wednesday's explosions. Obtained by CNN Hezbollah on Tuesday vowed to respond to the Israeli pager attacks that killed at least 12 people and injured thousands across Lebanon. At least two children were killed in those blasts, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said. United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the pager attacks were a violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the use of booby traps – objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use – and called for an “independent, thorough and transparent investigation.” Speculation has mounted over how low-tech wireless communication devices could have been exploited, as well as the origins of those devices and a mysterious supply chain stretching from Taiwan to Hungary. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah. A switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, it added. But Gold Apollo denied making the pagers bearing its brand name, and pointed to a Budapest-registered distributor as the manufacturer. Hungarian authorities denied Gold Apollo’s suggestion, saying that BAC Consulting “is a trading intermediary” with no manufacturing sites in the country. Fears of escalation The twin attacks in Lebanon risk further escalating tensions in the region already heightened over Israel’s war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged parties to avert any further escalation. The UN chief said the “logic” of making all the devices explode was that of a “pre-emptive strike before a major military operation.” Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN he fears the consecutive attacks signal a move to an “introduction to war.” “It’s a scary moment and we are afraid (of) coming to war, because we don’t want a war,” said the foreign minister, calling on the UN Security Council and the United States to help re-establish peace along the Lebanon-Israel border. CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer also suggested Israel’s disruption of Hezbollah’s communications network could pave the way for an imminent military offensive in Lebanon. “The fact that Israel got into their supply network is unprecedented,” Baer said, highlighting the disruption of Hezbollah’s use of walkie-talkies as particularly damaging because the group relies on them to call in fire coordinates, move ammunition and communicate in real time. This leaves Hezbollah vulnerable if Israel moves forward with its military plans. This is a developing story and will be updated.

The fact no details about the operation were given meant US officials were in the dark until reports of hundreds of exploding pagers emerged a short time later, the sources said. CNN has learned that Israel was behind the audacious attack, which has heightened tensions in a region already on edge even further, and it was a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad and the Israeli military. The Lebanese government condemned the attack as “criminal Israeli aggression.” At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 were injured, according to health officials in Lebanon, on Wednesday after walkie-talkies detonated in a fresh wave of explosions , one day after the pager blasts killed at least 12 people. Tuesday’s explosions came as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was traveling from Washington to Cairo on Tuesday, stunning US diplomats who watched the breaking news in real time on their airplane TVs. It wasn’t the first time that Israel has taken provocative action around the same time Blinken was on a visit to the Middle East. But this specific action triggered concerns about regional escalation that the US has long been trying to avoid. Blinken said the US “did not know about nor was it involved in these incidents.” The US conveyed to Iran via a back channel that they were not involved in the attack and that Iran should not escalate, a separate US official told CNN. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was injured by the exploding pagers, according to Iranian state media. Throughout the course of the nearly year-long war in Gaza, the US has consistently sent indirect messages to Tehran about not escalating. Gallant and Austin spoke a second time later Tuesday after it became clear thousands of Hezbollah members were wounded by exploding pagers, but officials declined to go into what was discussed. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that “the US was not involved” and was “not aware of this incident that hundreds of pagers … were going to explode in Lebanon ahead of time.” Jean-Pierre’s wording was precise in that the US was not told about specifically about exploding pagers in advance. The notification from Israel was far more generic and vague, leaving US officials with questions about what the operation could be, the sources said. Since Hamas’ October 7 attack, Israel has regularly carried out strikes in Lebanon in response to the launch of Hezbollah drones and missiles. Israel has also targeted senior Hamas officials in Lebanon. The breadth of Israeli operations in Lebanon over the past 11 months added to the questions about what Israel could be planning.

The resolution was adopted in the UN General Assembly after receiving 124 votes in favor. Fourteen countries voted against, including the United States, Hungary, Israel, Argentina, Czechia, Fiji, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Forty-three nations abstained from the vote. The vote comes after the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice, said in July that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal and called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories claimed by Palestinians for a future state. In its advisory opinion, the ICJ said Israel should end its occupation “as rapidly as possible.” The UN’s resolution gives a 12-month timeline. Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the UN, called the vote a turning point “in our struggle for freedom and justice.” The resolution was put forward by observer state Palestine, which was granted new privileges – including the right to submit proposals in the assembly – in May. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, meanwhile slammed the vote outcome as “a a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism.” Neither the ICJ advisory opinion nor the assembly resolution are binding, however the two decisions could further isolate Israel as world leaders prepare to meet next week in New York for the annual UN General Assembly. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas are expected to address other world leaders at the UN on September 26. Monitoring group Human Rights Watch (HRW) welcomed Wednesday’s resolution. “Israel should immediately heed the demand of an overwhelming majority of UN member states to abide by the World Court’s historic ruling on Israel’s decades-long occupation,” Louis Charbonneau, UN director at HRW, said in a statement. Amnesty International also welcomed the resolution and called on Israel to abide by it. “This resolution vindicates long-standing calls from the Palestinian people and many countries around the world, by pursuing the implementation of the ICJ’s historic advisory opinion which confirmed Israel has a legal obligation to end its unlawful occupation of the OPT and its systemic discrimination against the occupied Palestinian population,” said Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said. During the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan heights from neighboring Arab states. Soon after, it began establishing Jewish settlements in these territories. The Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza for a future state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel considers the entirety of Jerusalem as its “eternal capital.”"

Comedian Chelsea Handler, actress Connie Britton and Bravo’s Andy Cohen are among those who have signed the letter, which asks Biden and Harris to “protect and support” Israel amid the ongoing war between the country and Hamas. “We are artists who want sustainable peace in the Middle East and recognize that the first essential step towards that peace is Hamas returning the 101 remaining hostages,” the letter, reported first by CNN, states. It comes weeks after six Israeli hostages , including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were killed by Hamas . The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the hostages’ bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The remaining hostages have been held for nearly a year, since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Among the other signatories are actors Mayim Bialik, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca Gayheart and Patricia Heaton; reality TV personalities Jill Zarin, Margaret Joseph and “The Bachelor” alum Colton Underwood; and social media influencers such as Ariel Martin, better known as Baby Ariel on TikTok, where she has over 36 million followers, and dancer Montana Tucker, who has nearly 10 million followers on TikTok. The letter, which is signed by both Jewish and non-Jewish performers and artists, was organized by four Jewish advocacy groups: StopAntisemitism, End Jew Hatred, 2024 New Voices and StandWithUs. “We are approaching one year since 251 hostages were brutally stolen from their lives and 1200 were murdered. It is so important to keep the spotlight on this,” 2024 New Voices founder Samantha Ettus told CNN. “Our celebrities have come together to draw attention to the 101 hostages remaining in Gaza, including five Americans. After the brutal execution of six hostages, the urgency of getting the world to talk about this is now. We need to put as much pressure as possible on Hamas to return the hostages.” Hersh Goldberg-Polin Courtesy Goldberg-Polin family video Related video Remembering slain Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin Earlier this month, US officials told CNN that doubts have been raised within the White House about whether the Israel-Hamas war can come to an end before Biden leaves office. According to a Human Rights Watch report released this summer , Hamas-led armed groups committed “numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity” that were “directed against a civilian population” in which “killing civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.” The US response to the Israel-Hamas war has divided some in the entertainment industry. Two weeks ago, a group of Hollywood stars, including Ariana Grande, Ben Affleck, Mahershala Ali, Cate Blanchett, Drake, Dua Lipa, Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Mark Ruffalo, signed their names on a new Artists4Ceasefire letter, which called on the US to halt arms sales to Israel. “Beyond our pain and mourning for all of the people there and their loved ones around the world we are motivated by an unbending will to stand for our common humanity,” the Artists4Ceasefire letter states. “We stand for freedom, justice, dignity and peace for all people – and a deep desire to stop more bloodshed.” The full 2024 New Voices letter can be found here ."

But its weakness has been exposed,"For years Hezbollah was seen as the world’s premiere non-state actor: the well-equipped, well-trained, well-led, highly disciplined and secretive jewel in the crown of Iran’s allies across the Middle East.","Sep 18, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Ben Wedeman,Middle East,"Beirut, Lebanon CNN — For years Hezbollah was seen as the world’s premier non-state actor: the well-equipped, well-trained, well-led, highly disciplined and secretive jewel in the crown of Iran’s allies across the Middle East. In May 2000, the group managed to drive Israel out of southern Lebanon after a grueling guerilla conflict. Six years later, it fought Israel to a standstill in a 34-day war. Since then, the Iranian-backed group has built up its arsenal of missiles and drones. In Syria, its troops fought alongside Iran and Russia against the opposition to the Assad regime. For the past 11 months, Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israel along the border almost daily, forcing more than 62,000 Israelis to flee their homes in the north of the Jewish state (while more than 100,000 Lebanese have fled the border area). But this summer, the façade of strength began to slip. On the evening of July 30, an Israeli drone fired two missiles into a residential building in southern Beirut, killing senior Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr. And on Tuesday, at approximately 3:30 p.m. Beirut time, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pagers exploded across areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, wounding almost 3,000 people and killing at least 12. On Wednesday afternoon, a fresh wave of explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs and towns in the south of the country, killing at least nine people, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Many of the devices that detonated were walkie-talkies, images showed. While Hezbollah has yet to release precise numbers, it’s clear many of its rank and file were injured in the explosions. Taken together, the missile attack and the exploding devices represent a dramatic infiltration by Israel of Hezbollah’s critical command and control networks. Never has the group been so vulnerable, never has it been so compromised. Hezbollah has vowed to take revenge on Israel. Its credibility depends on it. But realistically, what can it do? Not much, its recent track record suggests. To avenge Shukr’s killing, on August 25 Hezbollah launched more than 300 drones and missiles at targets in Israel, including, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claimed, the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency and Unit 8200, Israel’s signals intelligence unit. Israel denied any important targets were struck and no evidence has been made public to contradict that denial. Most of the people who carried the devices that exploded were probably field officers, the local linchpins for cells of fighters who make up the backbone of Hezbollah’s forces. And now perhaps two thousand, or more, have been temporarily knocked out of commission, or worse. The communications network of which the pagers and walkie-talkies were a key part is almost certainly offline. Hezbollah’s intelligence officers must be desperately trying to figure out how all this happened. Even if a decision is taken to retaliate against Israel, how will the order be passed down the line, and who will – or even can – carry it out? Already the border conflict has come at a high cost to Hezbollah, which concedes it has lost more than 400 fighters since October last year, compared with around 250 killed in the far more intense 34-day war with Israel in 2006. An ambulance drives through a southern suburb of Beirut after explosions were heard. Bilal Hussein/AP Related article Dozens of walkie-talkies explode in Lebanon one day after pager blasts injure thousands, state media reports Hezbollah continues to put on a brave face, vowing to carry on striking Israeli targets as long the war in Gaza goes on. “Morale is high, and the injured will return to the front,” a man who described himself as a “Hezbollah supporter” told CNN as he waited for news of a wounded friend being treated in hospital. Hezbollah is in a corner. Israel is no longer willing to tolerate the slow-burn war on its northern border and is resorting to ever more extreme and potentially escalatory measures. There is little Hezbollah can do to stop Israel, or to retaliate."

A child was among at least nine killed in the blasts, which wounded about 2,800 people, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said. At least 170 people are in a critical condition, he said, though the nature of the other injuries is unclear. The attack underscores Hezbollah’s vulnerability as its communication network was compromised to deadly effect and follows a series of targeted assassinations against its commanders. Meanwhile, dozens of walkie talkies exploded in Lebanon on Wednesday, leaving at least one person dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry, which said the affected devices belonged to Hamas members. The incidents risk further escalating tensions in the Middle East already heightened over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. CNN has learned Tuesday’s explosions were the result of a joint operation between Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. While the Israeli military has said it will not comment on the explosions, both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed it for the attack. Iran also blamed what it referred to as “Israeli terrorism.” Speculation has mounted over how low-tech wireless communication devices could have been exploited. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel hid explosives inside a batch of pagers ordered from Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo and destined for Hezbollah. A switch was embedded to detonate them remotely, it added. Gold Apollo’s founder and chairperson told reporters Wednesday that the pagers used in the attack were made by a European distributor. Hsu Ching-kuang said his firm had signed a contract with the distributor to use the Gold Apollo brand. Videos circulating on social media and news agencies appear to show powerful explosions in locations across Lebanon. In one CCTV video, a man is seen picking out fruit in a supermarket when an explosion tears his bag to shreds. Bystanders run after hearing the blast, while the man drops to the ground clutching his lower abdomen. After several seconds, he can be heard groaning in pain. Other social media videos showed large numbers of injured people, including at least one child. Those wounded were covered in blood, many with facial and hand injuries.

It later said that its operations against Israel would continue and vowed “hard atonement awaiting the criminal enemy for the massacre it committed Tuesday.” The militant group had earlier confirmed on its Telegram channel that “workers” in various Hezbollah institutions were affected by the explosions, with a “large number” of people injured. Hezbollah has long touted secrecy as a cornerstone of its military strategy, forgoing high-tech devices to avoid infiltration from Israeli and US spyware. Unlike other non-state actors in the Middle East, Hezbollah units are believed to communicate through an internal communications network. This is considered one of the key building blocks of the powerful group that has long been accused of operating as a state-within-a-state. Iran’s Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those wounded in Beirut Tuesday, along with two embassy employees, according to Iranian state media. Amani has a superficial injury and is under observation in the hospital, state media IRNA reported, citing his wife. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati slammed Tuesday’sattack as “a serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards” in a cabinet meeting Tuesday, according to the state-run NNA news outlet. The Israeli military, which has engaged in tit-for-tat strikes with Hezbollah since the start of the war in Gaza last October, said in a statement following the pagerexplosions that it had no change in its advice to Israeli civilians. “The public are asked to remain alert and vigilant, and any change in policy will be updated immediately,” it said in a statement. Police officers inspect a car in which a pager exploded. Hussein Malla/AP Explosives placed in pagers The wave of explosions affected several areas in Lebanon, particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, according to Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces. NNA reported that “hacked” pager devices exploded in the towns of Ali Al-Nahri and Riyaq in the central Beqaa valley, resulting in a significant number of injuries. The locations are Hezbollah strongholds. Israel placed explosive material in a batch of Taiwanese-made pagers imported into Lebanon and destined for Hezbollah, The New York Times reported, citing American and other officials briefed on the operation. The explosives were planted next to the battery in each pager, and a switch embedded to detonate them remotely, according to The New York Times. CNN previously reported that the pagers that exploded had been purchased by Hezbollah in recent months, according to a Lebanese security source. The devices detonated simultaneously after receiving a message on Tuesday afternoon. Multiple photos from Lebanon on social media appear to show damaged Gold Apollo pagers. CNN cannot geolocate the images from social media but has verified they were published on Tuesday, the same day as the explosions. At least one pager shown in the images was a Gold Apollo AR924 model. Eyewitnesses described the carnage in Beirut following the blasts. “We were surprised that there were a lot of people … there was blood on the roads and people were being transported in ambulances to the hospital. But we did not know what was happening,” said one witness, who did not want to be named for safety reasons. The witness told CNN he went to a hospital to visit a friend who had been carrying one of the pagers when it exploded. “This device was not only in the hands of people who belong to [Hezbollah], but in the hands of all people. There were people working in the security field who were using that device and they were also hurt,” he said. David Kennedy, a former US National Security Agency intelligence analyst, told CNN the explosions seen in videos shared online appear to be “too large for this to be a remote and direct hack that would overload the pager and cause a lithium battery explosion.” “It’s more likely that Israel had human operatives… in Hezbollah… The pagers would have been implanted with explosives and likely only to detonate when a certain message was received,” he said. “The complexity needed to pull this off is incredible. It would have required many different intelligence components and execution. Human intelligence (HUMINT) would be the main method used to pull this off, along with intercepting the supply chain in order to make modifications to the pagers.” Kim Ghattas, a Lebanese journalist and contributing writer to The Atlantic magazine, told CNN that Hezbollah had recently “gone low tech” in an attempt to prevent more of its operatives from being assassinated. In a February speech, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah called on his fighters to discard their mobile phones, saying, “shut it off, bury it, put it in an iron chest and lock it up.” Pagers made by European distributor More details emerged Wednesday of how Israeli intelligence may possibly have engineered the unprecedented attack. Hsu, the founder of pager manufacturer Gold Apollo, said its European distributor established a relationship with the Taiwanese firm about three years ago. At first, the European company only imported Gold Apollo’s pager and communication products, he said. Later, the company told Gold Apollo they wished to make their own pager and asked for the right to use the Taiwanese firm’s brand, he said. Hsu said Gold Apollo had encountered at least one anomaly in its dealings with the distributor, citing a wire transfer that took a long time to clear. In a statement, Gold Apollo said the company that produces and sells the AR924 pager model is Hungary-based BAC Consulting KFT. Taiwan has no record of Gold Apollo pagers being shipped to Lebanon or the Middle East, a senior Taiwanese security official told CNN on Wednesday. Gold Apollo shipped about 260,000 pagers from Taiwan from January 2022 to August 2024, mostly to the United States and Australia, the official said. Lebanese officials have urged citizens with pagers to discard them, warned hospitals to be on “high alert,” and asked health workers to urgently report to work to assist with the “large number of injured people.” The explosions come after Israel’s security cabinet voted Monday to add another war objective to its ongoing conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah: ensuring the safe return of residents from communities along its border with Lebanon to their homes. “Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Monday. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani, pictured in July, was among those injured, according to semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters After nearly a year of cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. The US was “not involved” in the series of pager explosions in Lebanon and was “not aware” of any attack in advance, according to a State Department spokesperson. Following the attacks, European airlines Air France and Lufthansa suspended flights to Tel Aviv at least through Thursday “due to the security situation locally.” Air France said it is also suspending flights to Beirut through Thursday, amid fears of escalation in the region.

The country’s security cabinet voted on the measure during a late night meeting that lasted into the early hours of Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said, adding that “Israel will continue to act to implement this objective.” Though the return of residents of northern Israel has long been understood to be a political necessity, this is the first time it has been made an official war goal. According to Israeli government data shared with CNN last month, more than 62,000 people from the north of the country are internally displaced since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began on October 8, a day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel. Across the border in Lebanon, more than 94,000 have been displaced, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Officials and residents from Israel’s northern region have become increasingly vocal about the need to return to their homes, piling pressure on the government to act against the threat of Hezbollah’s rockets from southern Lebanon. The addition of the new war aim may push Israel to shift its military focus to its northern front as it warns that its patience for reaching a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah is running thin. Earlier on Monday, Netanyahu told US envoy Amos Hochstein in Tel Aviv that it won’t be possible to return the northern residents without a “fundamental change in the security situation in the north,” according to his office. He added that Israel will “do what is necessary” to safeguard the region’s security and return the residents to their homes. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was however more specific, saying in a post on X after meeting Hochstein that the only way to allow the residents of the north to return is “though military action.” Hochstein cautioned Netanyahu against initiating a wider war in Lebanon, Axios reported , citing sources it didn’t identify. Hezbollah has said that it will end its attacks on Israel when Israel ends its war in Gaza. Gallant’s fate The addition to Israel’s war aims comes amid reports in Israel that Netanyahu plans to replace Gallant with a former rival politician, Gideon Sa’ar. Unlike Gallant, who served for decades in the Israel Defense Forces, Sa’ar is a near lifelong politician. Reports of his potential appointment as defense minister have already caused a stir in Israel’s political and military establishment. Tension between the prime minister and Gallant had been omnipresent in their relationship, despite a period of unity following Hamas’ October 7 attack.

Gallant, who had increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned colleagues that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.” “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time,” he added. Dismissing Gallant could cause a backlash in Israel. Netanyahu’s attempt to fire him in March last year due to Gallant’s opposition to the government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary prompted large public protests. The prime minister eventually backed down. On Monday evening, crowds gathered outside Sa’ar’s house in Tel Aviv to protest his potential appointment and express concerns about its possible impact on the fate of the hostages in Gaza. Opposition leader Benny Gantz on Tuesday slammed reports of Gallant’s potential dismissal. “Replacing a minister of defense on the brink of a possible more intense campaign in the north, which could turn into a regional war is, in my opinion, is irresponsible security-wise,” he said in a statement. He said the addition of the new war aim was “better late than never.” CNN’s Mick Krever contributed to this report."

This is the first time since the October 7 attacks that Blinken has visited the Middle East without visiting Israel. The top US diplomat typically uses the visits to Israel to press the Israeli government on the critical issues surrounding the war, including the hostage and ceasefire deal. However, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently rebuffed the administration in the hours and days following those meetings. At the time of Blinken’s last visit in August US officials were projecting public optimism that they could be close to bringing the deal to a close. Now, that public optimism around a quick resolution has largely vanished. The State Department said in their announcement that Blinken “will meet with Egyptian officials to discuss ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of all hostages, alleviates the suffering of the Palestinian people, and helps establish broader regional security.” He will also “co-chair the opening of the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty,” the statement said, noting that the “strategic dialogue aims to strengthen the bilateral relationship and deepen economic development, as well as increase people-to-people ties through culture and education.” Egypt is a critical player in the ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire deal, but Blinken’s trip is unlikely to yield a major breakthrough on the agreement that comes down to the political will of two men: Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. There is skepticism that either wants to reach a deal. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield notably said on Monday that an agreement is ultimately dependent on political will. “We continue to work with Egypt and Qatar to find a way forward in the negotiations that will be acceptable to both parties. But as hard as we are going to work on texts and creative formulas, this is ultimately a question of political will,” Thomas-Greenfield said. While Blinken is in Egypt this week, the families of the US hostages held by Hamas will be visiting Washington, DC, as they continue pushing urgently for a deal to release their loved ones. But any timeframe for next steps remains elusive. The US proposal to find a solution to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas has yet to be presented to both sides and when that will happen remains unclear, despite US officials claiming earlier this month that it was near completion. “We will offer this detailed proposal, I hope in the coming days, and then we’ll see,” said CIA director Bill Burns on September 7. The US accused Hamas of adding “new demands” to the existing proposal after the murder of six hostages in their custody in Gaza. US officials have not publicly detailed those new demands. Netanyahu has also been accused of adding new conditions to the negotiations. The last time Blinken visited Israel, he said that Netanyahu had agreed to the “bridging proposal” meant to close to close the remaining gaps with Hamas. But the next day, Netanyahu reportedly told hostage families that Israel would never leave the Philadelphi corridor – a key aspect of a deal – in comments a senior administration official pushed back on as “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line.” Less than two weeks later – after six hostages were executed by Hamas – Netanyahu said there was no deal in the making. Still, US officials have been reticent to directly criticize Netanyahu despite his unhelpful public comments. Blinken said earlier this month that “it’s incumbent on both parties” – Israel and Hamas – “to get to yes” on the “remaining issues” related to a ceasefire and hostage deal. But last week Sinwar wrote a rare letter to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, according to the Lebanese militant group, in which he reaffirmed his commitment to fighting Israel. And Netanyahu’s comments earlier this month that there is “not a deal in the making” served as a major rebuke of the Biden administration’s claims that an agreement is nearly finished. A senior Biden administration official said earlier this month that the majority of the details of the first phase of the agreement had been worked out. The remaining sticking points, they said, are related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces within Gaza away from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Blinken said last week: “we’re down to a handful of issues – not even a handful of issues – that are hard but fully resolvable, in our judgment.” “Right now, we’re working intensely with our Egyptian and Qatari counterparts to work together to bridge any remaining gaps.  And in the coming time, very soon, we’ll put that before the parties and we’ll see what they say,” he said. Blinken’s comments, however, echoed his sentiments for months. In late July, Blinken said that the talks were “inside the 10-yard line,” but also noted that the last 10 yards are “often the hardest.” As of now, President Joe Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present the president with an updated proposal in the ceasefire negotiations , two senior administration officials told CNN – the latest indication that talks to end the conflict have seriously stalled. Recent comment by US officials have been careful to work in a dose of apprehension. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Thursday said the US was still working on the bridging proposal. He acknowledged that it remains unclear if “we’re going to be able to get there” on a deal."

The projectile was fired from Yemen toward Israel at 6am local time on Sunday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) who added that it “most likely fragmented in mid-air.” The missile fell in an open area in central Israel, with no injuries reported. Videos and images shared by the Israel Fire and Rescue Authority on Telegram show large plumes of smoke billowing into the air over an open field, and shattered glass inside a train station in Modi’in, a city between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A spokesman for the Iran-backed Houthis military spokesman confirmed the attack, claiming that the group used a “new hypersonic ballistic missile” and warning that Israel should expect more such strikes as the first anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas approaches. The IDF told CNN that the projectile was not a hypersonic missile. Despite months of tensions it is a rare instance of a missile penetrating as far as central Israel, normally safe for civilians.

Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas’ political bureau, commended the strike in a public letter to Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi, the leader of Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement, saying it “sent a message to the enemy that the plans of containment and neutralization have failed.” The letter emphasized Hamas’ readiness for a prolonged conflict, vowing that combined efforts with the Houthis, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and other regional actors would ultimately break Israel’s political and military strength. Israeli police said they were working with the police bomb squad in the Shfela area, also known as the Judaean Foothills, where an interceptor fragment had fallen. Authorities are now isolating the impact site and scanning for additional interceptor remains, police said. Sirens rang across central and northern Israel, the military said, and sirens were also sounded at Tel Aviv airport, the airport’s spokesperson told CNN. Videos on social media showed passengers running to find shelter. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a news conference in Tehran that Iran hasn’t provided the Houthis with hypersonic missiles. “They have the technology, they learned it even before this war started. They are producing them themselves,” Pezeshkian said. Iran unveiled its first hypersonic missile last year, boasting that it can reach Tel Aviv in 400 seconds . Also on Sunday morning, approximately 40 projectiles crossed from Lebanon into Israel’s northern region, some of them intercepted and others falling in open areas, the IDF said. No injuries were reported, and authorities are putting out fires caused by the fallen projectiles. Hezbollah has been firing almost daily barrages of projectiles and drones into Israel. “The existing reality will not continue,” said Netanyahu, adding that a “change in the balance of power” is needed at the northern border to ensure residents could return home. The IDF meanwhile opened an investigation following reports that leaflets were dropped in southern Lebanon warning civilians to leave. The leaflets, written in Arabic and found in the area of Wazzani, a village within a few kilometers of the border with Israel, told residents that Hezbollah was firing from their area and that they should “not come back to this area until the end of the war.” The IDF said in a statement Sunday that the disperal of leaflets was “an independent initiative of the 769th Brigade in the Northern Command,” and was not approved by the IDF’s high command. Fears of escalation Tensions between Israel, Yemen and Lebanon have been escalating for months as Israel has waged its war on Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 attacks. World leaders have warned of the potential for a wider Middle East conflict. Since the war began, the Iran-backed Houthi group, which controls Yemen’s most populous regions, has regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles. Most of these have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses or those of its allies. It has also targeted shipping in the Red Sea, as a rejection of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Most notably in July, the group claimed responsibility for a deadly drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center – the first time the city has been struck by a Houthi drone. Israel struck back the next day with deadly airstrikes on a Yemeni port – the first such strike on Yemen, according to Israeli officials. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon has also carried out attacks on northern Israel, sending rockets and drones on Saturday targeting Israeli military sites. These direct attacks on each other’s soil have raised alarm that there could be a new front in the ongoing conflict, which is already threatening to spill over across the region. Israel launched its war in Gaza after the militant group Hamas’ cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Since then, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military operations in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its figures, but says most of the dead are women and children.

AI could contribute $320 billion to the Middle East by 2030, about 2% of the total global benefits, according to a report from consultancy PwC . “There’s huge investments going into (AI) in the Middle East,” said Stephen Anderson, Middle East strategy and markets leader at PwC, speaking to CNN at last week’s Global AI Summit (GAIN) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “Here in the region, people were much more prepared to experiment and get involved with AI than maybe some other parts of the world,” he added. One issue around the rapid growth of AI is that it can be hugely energy intensive, and it is increasingly becoming a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Google reported that its 2023 emissions were nearly 50% more than in 2019 , which it partly attributed to the energy demands of AI. Energy demand from AI, data centers and cryptocurrencies could double by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency . But Anderson believes that Gulf countries, whose economies are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, are well placed to become “major players” in the technology, and have the potential to make it greener. “We’re at the center of the world when it comes to energy – not just old energy, but particularly new energy,” he said. “This is the lowest-cost place anywhere in the world to produce solar energy. So the opportunity to combine sustainability and energy with the computer power that’s required from an AI perspective is really important.” Anderson pointed to the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia as the region’s leading investors in AI. As Saudi Arabia looks to cut its economy’s reliance on oil and gas, it has invested heavily in AI, which it says will help to realize the objectives outlined in its “Vision 2030” strategy, a government program to diversify the economy. According to a recent projection from the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA), which hosted the GAIN summit, AI will contribute 12% of its GDP by 2030, with the sector growing at an annual rate of 29%. Gulf states are investing heavily in AI as they look to diversify their economies. CNN There have been significant efforts across the region to develop Arabic-language models trained on local datasets that capture the nuances of the language in a way that has been lacking on platforms like ChatGPT. Last year, the UAE unveiled a tool called Jais and Saudi Arabia has developed the Arabic chatbot ALLaM. Last week, it was announced that ALLaM will be hosted on Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform . This follows the news from earlier this year that it would also be accessible through IBM’s watsonx platform. Nick Studer, CEO at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman Group, who attended the GAIN summit, said that the focus on Arabic language models could help Saudi Arabia compete with English-speaking markets that have an “underlying advantage” in the space because of the many large language models available According to Studer, there are over half a dozen Arabic-based large language models in development in the country, focusing on a range of uses cases, from chat to governmental and corporate applications. “That combination of governmental and private sector entrepreneurialism may well lead to the development of an AI hub, particularly as the kingdom and the wider region seek to diversify their economies,” he said. Challenge of governance One of the major hurdles with the development of AI is public perception and governance: how should AI and data be regulated safely, securely, ethically and fairly? During the summit, various policies were announced, including the launch of guidelines from the SDAIA addressing the responsible use of deep fakes, the unveiling of the Riyadh Charter for AI in the Islamic World, which establishes a framework for developing AI technologies in line with Islamic values and principles, and a global framework for AI readiness , led by the International Telecommunication Union. Studer says a solid regulatory framework is essential for the future of AI. “There are many concerns that go with the development of AI - not just privacy concerns, not just the risks of losing jobs, but also all the way up to national sovereignty if your economy starts to rely on a set of tools which are built outside of your control,” he said. “It is critical that we have sensible regulation in place.”"

The hostages were two soldiers - Corporal Nick Beiser and Sergeant Ron Sherman – and and civilian man, Eliya Toledano. Recovering the hostages captured by Hamas on October 7 is one of the main goals of Israel’s campaign in Gaza and the government is under intense domestic pressure to secure their release. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the families of all three were informed Sunday after the conclusion of the investigation, which involved intelligence and operational research efforts and considerations of the security of the hostages. “It is estimated that the three were most likely killed as a by-product of an IDF airstrike, during the assassination of the commander of the northern division of Hamas, Ahmed Andor, on November 10, 2023.” “This is an estimate with a high probability in view of all the data, but it is not possible to determine with certainty the circumstances of their death,” the IDF said. “This determination is based on the location where their bodies were found in relation to the impact of the attack,” as well as intelligence findings and pathological reports.

At the time of the attack, the IDF did not have information about the presence of hostages in the compound that was attacked, and moreover, there was information that indicated their location elsewhere.” The IDF said that throughout the war, it has not attacked in areas where there are indications or suspicions about the presence of hostages. The bodies of the three hostages were retrieved from the tunnel where Andor had been staying on December 14. Later that month Hamas claimed that the three hostages were “killed by IDF weapons.” A total of 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). 35 of those are believed to be dead. Hostage release efforts are ongoing and gained new urgency earlier this month with the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah, including the Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin . US officials are trying to get both sides to agree to a deal first laid out by US President Joe Biden in May. The three-phase proposal pairs the release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.” Since then talks have stuttered and both sides have pointed to what they see as glaring holes in the framework, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that Israel’s forces will never leave the stretch along the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor."

The sound of Israeli drones buzzes overhead – a stark reminder of the fighting that has engulfed the strip for more than 11 months. “We have war, no schools… Yet the children are eager to learn,” Al Ghoul told CNN. She decided to set up a rudimentary classroom in the same tent in which she’s living, just to give some first-graders a chance to study. “Even the parents come and ask about their children’s progress in writing, asking if they are improving.” But her initiative is the exception. As children across the Middle East begin the new semester, those in Gaza will be unable to return to school.

The IDF has said strikes on schools target Hamas militants and has previously insisted it take steps to minimize harm to civilians. Hamas has denied embedding fighters in civilian infrastructure. Many schools have turned into makeshift shelters, as hundreds of thousands of people seek refuge from Israel’s bombardment. Several Palestinian children told CNN that days spent learning have been replaced by a struggle for survival. Some spend hours queueing for water or food aid, as Israel’s siege has depleted supplies. Aid workers say that displacement camps are crammed with children who have no safe space to play. . “I aspired to complete my studies and help my father feed my family,” said Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a 19-year-old English literature student, displaced in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza. She told CNN on Friday that she had registered for her university course last fall – just before the hostilities erupted. “The war destroyed all my ambitions and there was nothing left.” Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least 41,182 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000 others, the Ministry of Health there reported on Thursday.

The Israeli offensive in Gaza has displaced 1.9 million people, according to the UN – almost the entire population. Sajid, a young Palestinian displaced in Deir al-Balah, told CNN he dreamed of becoming a doctor, before the war disruption access to education in Gaza. CNN “We used to study, attend classes, do homework, and our lives were happy,” Maryam Shtawi, a young girl staying in the shelter, told CNN on Monday. “Because of the war, we were displaced, and there is no more education, nothing else – no studies.

If I had stayed in school, I would have grown up to become a famous doctor.” There’s no guarantee of safety for those sheltering in schools. At least 70% of schools run by UNRWA have been hit during the war – 95% of which were being used as shelters for displaced people – the agency reported on September 9 . On Wednesday, at least 18 people, including UNRWA staff, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a UN school-turned-shelter in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, according to the Gaza Civil Defense and hospital officials. The IDF claimed the school “was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel.” UNRWA said that their employees were teachers. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described Israeli strikes on schools as “dramatic violations of international humanitarian law.” Children have also been uprooted from one shelter to another, parents told CNN. The lack of stability or routine will compound psychological trauma for children who have witnessed scenes of bloodshed, lost loved ones or been orphaned by the war, according to UNICEF. “The students’ situation is tough; they need to be learning right now… Unfortunately, none of the students can write. There are no schools, no books, nothing,” said Mohammad Masoud, a teacher. “Instead of being in their classes or universities, students are either selling on the streets or trying to help their families by standing in line for water or food.” Meanwhile, at least 19,000 children have been separated from their parents or caregivers, the UN reported in August . ‘They are literally wading through rubbish’ Further south, in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, children run barefoot through the littered streets, according to a relief worker in the sprawling coastal town.

There aren’t really safe spaces for kids to play. “I’ve seen children with no shoes on, barefoot and amongst rubbish dumps that extend as far as the eye can see. They are literally wading through rubbish, plastic, all sorts of waste.

Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were also added to the list, according to a diplomatic source. “It’s a case of compounding vulnerabilities that are unlike any other place I have worked as a humanitarian,” said Allcock. “The actions taken by the Israeli military that have resulted in this situation – the denial of adequate aid, the bombardment and airstrikes on civilians and humanitarian zones – is a violation of every kind of possible child right that is enshrined in international law.”"

One of Israel’s most wanted men, Sinwar hasn’t been seen since the war. He also hadn’t been publicly heard from for almost a year – until this week. On Tuesday, he issued his first statement since the war, congratulating Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune for his election victory, according to Hamas’ Telegram channel. The next day, his office said he wrote letters thanking those who offered condolences for Haniyeh’s death. And on Friday came the letter to Nasrallah.

I’m constantly updated and aware of everything happening outside Gaza,” said Muhammad Shehada, a writer and analyst from Gaza. “He wants to show that he is able to operate on multiple fronts, the domestic front – the battlefield in Gaza – and the diplomatic front – mediations.” The target audience for such letters, he said, is primarily Israel, to whom Sinwar is attempting to show that despite efforts to find him, he is still able to continue working without interference. The other target, Shehada added, is Hamas, including “skeptics from inside the movement or even mediators like Qatar, the US and Egypt, who doubt that he might be able to fulfill his leadership role from the tunnels in Gaza.” Sinwar was named political leader of Hamas after Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran in July. He is seen as more hardline than his predecessor in dealings with Israel and favors cooperation and closer ties with Iran and allied Islamist groups such as Hezbollah. Shehada said Sinwar is “one of the strongest advocates of a stronger relationship with Hezbollah and Iran, and deepening the alliance with the Axis of Resistance.” “He is perceived in the movement as pragmatic, but at the same time very unpredictable and impulsive. But pragmatic nonetheless,” he said. In his letter to Nasrallah, Sinwar vowed to continue defending Islamic holy sites, particularly Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa Mosque “until the expulsion and eradication of the occupation from our land, and the establishment of our independent state with full sovereignty and its capital Jerusalem.” The October 7 attack, he said, was “one of the most honorable battles in the history of our Palestinian people.” CNN’s Ibrahim Dahman and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Brigadier General Yossi Sariel, who led its 8200 intelligence unit, has informed them he will “conclude his role in the near future.” The country’s public broadcaster Kan and several other media outlets have published excerpts of his resignation letter stating he feels personally responsible for not preventing Hamas from launching the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. “On October 7th at 06:29 I did not fulfill the task as I expected of myself, those at my command and commanders expected me and the citizens of the state I love so much,” the letter said. “Today, in accordance with the state of the war, the processes of the gathering ranks and the building of the unit’s resilience, and after the completion of the initial investigative processes, I request to fulfill my personal responsibility as the commander of the unit on October 7 and at a time to be determined by my commanders to pass the baton to the next shift,” it continued. Shortly after the attack, a number of top defense and security officials came forward to take responsibility, to some extent, for missteps that led to Hamas’ attack on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. On October 16, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency , Shin Bet, tasked with combating terrorism, wrote a statement saying: “The responsibility is on me.” “Despite a series of actions we carried out, we weren’t able to create a sufficient warning that would allow the attack to be thwarted,” Shin Bet chief Ronan Bar said. Later that month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also received sharp public criticism after he accused security chiefs in a later-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending attack. In a May interview with Dr. Phil McGraw on the “Dr. Phil Primetime” show, Netanyahu admitted there were political and military failures. “The government’s first responsibility is to protect the people. That’s the ultimate enveloping responsibility. People weren’t protected. We have to admit that,” Netanyahu told Dr. Phil. When asked if he held himself to that standard and failed in some way he added, “I hold myself and everyone on this. I think we have to examine how it happened.

UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, said on X that six of its employees were killed “when two airstrikes hit a school and its surroundings in Nuseirat,” in what is “the highest death toll among our staff in a single incident.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that the Israeli Air Force had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists” operating inside the school compound. It claimed the school “was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel.” Later on Thursday, the IDF said three of the UNRWA employees killed in the strike were members of Hamas, but did not immediately provide evidence to support the allegation. UNRWA said the three people named by the IDF were teachers, and their names were not included in previous lists of UNRWA staffers that Israel claimed were members of Hamas, including a list from July. The IDF said earlier that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,” saying the incident was “a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law.” The strike targeted the Al Jaouni UNRWA facility, which has not operated as a school since October. An estimated 12,000 displaced people, including women and children, have been sheltering in the school, said UNRWA.

Mahmoud Basal, a Gaza Civil Defense spokesman, said search operations were ongoing amid the rubble, with children and women among the injured. The strike drew condemnation from various officials, including the UN chief. “What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X. “These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now.” His spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, added on Thursday that “the IDF stated that they had targeted a command-and-control center in the compound. This incident must be independently and thoroughly investigated to ensure accountability.” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said UN staff were working and “providing support to families who have sought refuge in the school.” “Since the beginning of this war, at least 220 UNRWA staff have been killed in Gaza ,” he wrote on X. “The longer impunity prevails, the more international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant.” Sam Rose, a senior official at UNRWA, told the BBC in an interview on Thursday that the school had been used as a polio vaccination center just a week before it was struck. Earlier this month, the United Nations led a campaign to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza against polio , amid a resurgence of the disease in the strip since the war began. The head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also condemned the strike, writing on X : “Indeed, terribly tragic. No words can reflect the true horror and loss of life in Gaza.” “Hospitals, schools and shelters have been repeatedly bombarded, resulting in deaths of civilians and humanitarians,” he added. “The carnage in Gaza must stop. Ceasefire!” People use a blanket to transport a victim after an Israeli air strike hit the Al Jaouni school in Nuseirat, in the central Gaza Strip on September 11, 2024. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images A colleague of the UN workers who were killed told CNN that the group had been distributing food aid earlier and had just sat down to eat lunch when Israel bombed the school. The strike hit the school seconds after she had left to fetch water for the rest of the team from the next room, she said, asking to remain anonymous because she isn’t authorized to speak to the media. “Suddenly, I heard a big explosion. Everything shook. I ran back to see that they had all vanished… all torn to pieces,” she told CNN on the phone, referring to her colleagues. All six of the UNRWA workers had worked as teachers at the school before the war started and they were well-known members of the local community, she added. “They are all loved by everyone. They helped and provided aid to everyone… What Israel is claiming is an unacceptable lie. No resistance fighters existed or operated from the school,” she said. ‘We are all civilians here’ Footage from the scene showed debris strewn around a compound and blood stains on the ground. A hole punctured what appeared to be a classroom and among the rubble was canned food and the dust-covered belongings of displaced Palestinians. A man carrying human remains said: “Brutality, I don’t know what to say.” Another man searched desperately for his wife and four children. “I don’t know where they are, my son, my three daughters are all missing,” Hani Haniya said from a classroom in the building. “They normally sit here, I don’t know where my wife is, she survived the last strike.” Displaced Palestinians take shelter at a UN school and watch after an Israeli air strike hits the site in Nuseirat, Gaza Strip, on September 11, 2024, amid the ongoing war in the Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas.

We don’t have any resistance fighters here, none of them enter the school. Look around, it’s all food aid,” he said. “The people who were distributing the aid are the ones who died, civilians. We are all civilians here who are dying,” he added. Hassan Al Hilu, who had been displaced from Gaza City, was working on the school’s sewage pipes when the strike hit the building. He was thrown in the air by the blast, injuring one of his hands. “They are all very good people. I know them all. They are all UNRWA workers. They were always working on distributing aid, like rice, coupons, cleaning products to people in the school,” Al Hilu told CNN. “They were eating (when the strike hit).” Rabia Al Burdeini, who lives next to the school, told CNN that some of the victims were “torn to pieces” while others lost their limbs. “Suddenly, without any prior warning.” FILE - Yahya Sinwar chairs a meeting with leaders of Palestinian factions at his office in Gaza City, April 13, 2022.

Mohammed Qassem Al-Shaer, a commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, was killed in a strike on the village of Qaraoun in the western Beqaa district on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF said Al-Shaer had “advanced numerous terrorist activities against the state of Israel” and his “elimination” would impair the Iran-backed militant group’s ability to launch attacks against Israel from southern Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed Al-Shaer had been killed and said it responded to his killing by launching “dozens” of Katyusha rockets and several drones toward two locations in northern Israel. No casualties were reported, according to the IDF, which said some of the “projectiles” were intercepted and others fell in an open area. The IDF said it responded by striking Hezbollah launchers “in the areas of Mansouri and At Tiri,” which had been used in the attacks. On Wednesday, the IDF said it struck overnight 30 Hezbollah launchers and “terrorist infrastructure sites” in areas of southern Lebanon which “posed a threat to Israeli civilians.” Lebanese state media NNA reported multiple Israeli strikes overnight on several areas, some of which caused “extensive damage” to property, crops, and buildings in the town of Al-Qlaileh. In a statement Wednesday, Hezbollah said that another fighter was killed, but did not say where or the cause of death. It also did not mention the strikes.

A visual guide The Israeli military also said Tuesday its air force had struck a Hezbollah military structure in the village of Rachaf in the Nabatieh governorate of southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s emergency service said 12 people were wounded in the strike 12 on Rachaf. The latest strikes come weeks after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. Shukr was the most high-ranking Hezbollah official to have been assassinated since 2016, when Mustafa Badreddine , the group’s top commander at the time, was killed in Syria. The hostilities in July raised the specter of a regional conflagration, prompting intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on October 7.

Raneen Sawafta/Reuters Israeli strike on the occupied West Bank Israeli raids continued in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday with the IDF saying its “aircraft conducted an aerial strike during the counterterrorism operation in Tulkarem.” At least five people were killed in an overnight Israeli airstrike, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, after the Israeli military said Wednesday it carried out operations in the areas of Tammon and Tubas. The IDF said it began the operation with the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) “against terrorist infrastructures,” and an air strike was carried out on “an armed terrorist squad” in the Tubas area, the IDF said. The IDF added in a later statement that an Israeli “aircraft struck and eliminated a terrorist cell consisting of five terrorists armed with explosives who posed a threat to the forces” during its overnight operations in Tubas and Tammon. The governor of Tubas, Ahmad As’ad, told CNN the strike hit a group of “young unarmed Palestinians” around 3 a.m. local time. The group, who were in their teens and twenties, were sitting near a mosque at the time, he said. As’ad also said five people were killed, as did the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Video obtained by CNN showed at least one motionless body near a mosque in Tubas. As’ad said “we were informed by the Palestinian Coordination Office of an Israeli military operation on the city and surrounding areas” before the strike. Israeli forces raided the city and blocked access to the government hospital, he said, adding that there is an Israeli military imposed curfew. “The situation is dangerous,” he said. CNN has reached out to the IDF. The Israeli military has carried out major raids and airstrikes in multiple parts of the West Bank in recent weeks. On August 28, it launched a large counter-terror operation with the ISA in the areas of Jenin, Tulkarem and Tubas in the north of the West Bank, in an offensive Israel said was its most expansive in years. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that operation had been staged to “thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” claiming that Iran was working to establish an “eastern front” against Israel. Israel has stepped up its military operations in the West Bank, where clashes have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. Around 700 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah and the UN, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians."

Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, Gal Hirsch, told CNN’s Jessica Dean on Sunday that if all remaining 101 hostages are returned, “I even believe that we will agree to build safe passage to the chief terrorist, the new Hitler, Sinwar – safe passage to him and whoever he wants to join him out of Gaza.” Hirsch said those conditions, along with Gaza being “demilitarized and deradicalized,” could help recover Gaza and end the war.

We want demilitarization, de-radicalization of course — a new system that will manage Gaza.” He told Bloomberg that the offer of safe passage was put on the table a day and a half ago, but did not say what the response was. Israel would be open to releasing prisoners it holds as part of any deal, he told Bloomberg. CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment on Hirsch’s proposal, and has contacted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office for comment. On Wednesday, a diplomat briefed on ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel told CNN that there’s no indication that Sinwar wants to leave Gaza and that a potential safe passage out of the territory is not a priority for him. Sinwar believes he’s safer in Gaza than he would be in other countries like Iran or Lebanon, the diplomat said. Gal Hirsch appears on CNN on Sunday, September 8. CNN Sinwar, one of Hamas’ most powerful figures, is accused by Israel of being the key architect of the October 7 massacre in Israel, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostages. He is also among the Hamas leaders charged by US prosecutors over the deadly attack. Hamas announced Sinwar as the head of its political bureau last month, days after former political bureau head and top negotiator Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. He is believed to remain at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, US officials believe. He has not been seen in public since October 7. CNN’s Becky Anderson contributed to this report."

Israel said the operation targeted Hamas fighters there. At least 19 bodies arrived at hospitals from the humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi , according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. More than 60 people were also wounded, it said, as rescuers raced to recover victims buried under sand and debris. “People thought they were asleep safely. Suddenly we woke up to the sounds of explosions, and fires were surrounding us from every side. We didn’t know where the strike hit, where the remains are, or where the blood is. Everything was scattered,” Mahmoud Al Nims, a resident, told CNN.

Gaza’s humanitarian crisis hits new lows as sanitary conditions plummet According to the IDF, among those targeted were Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, whom the IDF says was the head of Hamas’ aerial unit in Gaza; Osama Tabesh, whom was “the head of the observation and targets department in Hamas’ military intelligence headquarters;” and Ayman Mabhouh, whom it said was “another senior Hamas terrorist.” The targets were “directly involved in the execution” of the October 7 attack on Israel and had been planning to “carry out terror activities” against the IDF and Israel, an IDF statement on Tuesday added. CNN is working to independently verify these claims. Hamas has denied it had placed fighters in the area. In a statement, it called Israel’s claims that its fighters were in the area “a blatant lie, through which it (Israel) seeks to justify these heinous crimes.” ‘They told us to go to Mawasi’ The strike hit Al-Mawasi, a coastal region in Khan Younis where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled Israel’s bombardment from other parts of Gaza. Many are living in tents in an area with sparse infrastructure, scant access to shelter or life-saving humanitarian aid. The explosion created three large craters, Gaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said. The group also said its crews were facing “great difficulty” in retrieving victims – many of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the time of the strikes – due to a lack of resources. Earlier, Gaza’s Civil Defense said 40 people had been killed , though the reason for the discrepancy in the two figures was not immediately clear. Human rights agencies have repeatedly criticized Israeli attacks in designated safe zones. On Tuesday, the Norwegian Refugee Council accused Israeli forces of “forcing Palestinians in Gaza to flee from place to place without offering them genuine assurances of safety, proper accommodation or return once hostilities end.” The Israeli military has placed nearly 86% of the Gaza Strip under evacuation orders, according to the UN. At least 1.9 million people have been displaced The strike was also strongly condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, whose spokesperson Stephane Dujarric described the use of heavy weaponry in densely populated areas like Al-Mawasi as “unconscionable.” Dujarric said that the strike reaffirmed the Secretary General’s warnings that “there is no safe place in Gaza.” “(Israeli forces) told us to go to Mawasi and we did, and they strike us. We have been displaced a hundred times,” Taghreed Abu Assi, a Palestinian in Khan Younis told CNN.

Jehad Alshrafi/Anadolu/Getty Images The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel has flattened neighborhoods, wiped out families and created a humanitarian disaster across the enclave. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 41,020 Palestinians and injured another 94,925 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN footage from the aftermath of the strike on Al-Mawasi showed dozens of people trying to recover the remains of their belongings. Poles that used to hold up tents protruded from the sand, but the material that covered their inhabitants was buried. Mattresses, blankets and clothes were scattered around another much bigger crater on the other side of the camp. Some survivors pulled canned food from under the sand and a girl with an injured hand watched as those around her attempt to rebuild their tents. “We were sleeping peacefully in our homes when, suddenly, rockets started falling heavily on us,” one survivor, Salem Abu Jara, told CNN. “Why are people being burned here?” Families ‘disappeared in the sand’ Israel’s military said the operation was carried out with the direction of the Israel Security Agency and the Air Force, and that steps were taken to mitigate civilian harm “including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional means.” The military did not say whether it warned civilians in the area. Hamas said “dozens of unarmed civilians, most of whom were children and women” were killed in the strike. Gaza Civil Defense’s Bassal said Palestinians in the area were not warned of the strike in advance. There were more than 200 tents of displaced people at Al-Mawasi area, Bassal said, adding about 20 to 40 tents were destroyed and “entire families have disappeared in the sand.” Two weapons experts told CNN the visual evidence from the scene of the assault in Al-Mawasi suggests 2,000-pound bombs were used. “The significant damage and the size of the craters align with the expected effects of aerial bombs weighing several hundred kilograms,” Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), said on Tuesday. CNN footage from the aftermath showed emergency crews wearing bright orange vests and scouring dense, blown-out debris for survivors. Rescue personnel could be seen hauling large pieces of barbed wire and dusty mattresses in the dark. The IDF has accused Hamas and other militant groups in the Gaza Strip of continuing to “systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure, including the designated Humanitarian Area, to carry out terrorist activity against the State of Israel and IDF troops.” Israel has previously struck Al-Mawasi in its pursuit for Hamas commanders and previous strikes have caused significant civilian collateral casualties. In mid-July, a strike aimed at Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif killed at least 90 Palestinians. The following month, Israel said its intelligence community had confirmed that Deif, one of the reported masterminds of the October 7 attacks, was killed in that attack. Israel says it has killed or captured half of Hamas’s commanders and more than 14,000 combatants since the war began. However, there are clear signs of the group’s resurgence in parts of the strip previously cleared by Israeli forces, who devastated large swathes of the area in the process.

The situation “escalated quickly” after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stopped the convoy at a checkpoint on Monday and demanded to take two of its 12 passengers for questioning, according to the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric. Dujarric said the Israeli soldiers had pointed their weapons at the UN personnel and that at some point during the incident “shots were fired.” He said IDF tanks and bulldozers then “proceeded to ram the UN vehicles from the back and front, compacting the convoy with UN staff still inside.” “One bulldozer dropped debris on the first vehicle, while Israeli soldiers threatened staff, making it impossible for them to safely exit their vehicles,” he added. The convoy was later released and UN officials have confirmed their staff returned safely to a UN base. CNN has asked the IDF for comment on Dujarric’s account of the incident, which took place at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint.

However, the UN has insisted that the convoy was involved in polio vaccinations and contained national and international staff members who were meant to be rolling out the  campaign for children in Gaza City and northern Gaza. Dujarric said that despite the incident, vaccinations were able to begin in northern Gaza on Tuesday – the third phase of the UN-led campaign which is expected to continue through Thursday. On Monday, Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the UNWRA – the UN’s main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief – criticized the IDF’s conduct in the incident as “the latest in a series of violations against UN staff including shootings at convoys and arrests by the Israeli Armed Forces at checkpoints despite prior notification.”"

Blinken’s sharply worded rebuke came after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire.” In its initial inquiry into the incident, the IDF said that the shot was not aimed at the activist, but at “the key instigator” of a “violent riot” at the Beita Junction where it said Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at Israeli security forces. It didn’t name the alleged instigator. The International Solidarity Movement (ISM), with whom Eygi had been volunteering, said that its protest on September 6 was peaceful. At a news conference in London on Tuesday, Blinken said Eygi’s killing was “unprovoked and unjustified” and demanded changes to the rules of engagement of Israel forces operating in the West Bank.

No one should have to put their life at risk just for expressing their views,” he said. “Now we have the second American citizen killed at the hands of Israeli security forces. It’s not acceptable. It has to change. And we’ll be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government.” Blinken added that the United States had “long seen” reports of Israeli forces ignoring extremist settler violence against Palestinians and reports of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into the occupied West Bank in recent months. In recent months, the US has unveiled a series of sanctions targeting Israel settler violence against Palestinians. The IDF began a major raid in multiple parts of the territory last month , bulldozing highways and razing buildings in the process. OIn Tuesday, at least two Palestinians – a man and a woman – were killed during an Israeli military incursion in the city of Tulkarem, according to the Ministry of Health in Ramallah. Israeli troops and settlers have killed 692 Palestinians, including 158 children, in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. Family says Israel’s inquiry is ‘wholly inadequate’ The family of the 26-year-old activist said they were “deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional,” reiterating calls to US leaders for an independent investigation into her death. Eygi, who was born in Turkey, was shot while taking part in a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law. She was a recent graduate of the University of Washington, and had been volunteering with the same pro-Palestinian activist group as Rachel Corrie , a US citizen killed in 2003 while attempting to stop an Israeli bulldozer from demolishing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Eygi’s family, who have previously blamed Israel for her killing, said the findings of the Israeli inquiry were “wholly inadequate.” “This cannot be misconstrued as anything except a deliberate, targeted and precise attack by the military against an unarmed civilian,” the family said. The ISM also dismissed Israel’s “specious claim” that Eygi was unintentionally hit by IDF fire, describing the slain activist as “one of the hundreds of thousands of martyrs Israel has killed over decades of ethnic cleansing, displacement, and genocide.” “The military’s account of the events is blindly based on the accomplices’ version, which completely contradicts the testimonies of multiple eye witnesses, who the military did not even contact,” the group said in a statement on Tuesday. “All eyewitnesses said immediately following the killing that the scene where Aysenur was killed was completely quiet, and that there could have been no excuse to open fire, let alone directly hitting a woman peacefully standing in an olive grove.” CNN’s Kareem Khadder, Sana Noor Haq and Antoinette Radford contributed reporting."

The Israel Airports Authority, which runs the border terminal at the Allenby Crossing with Jordan , told CNN that the three men who died worked at the crossing. “The terrorist shot dead three employees of the Allenby terminal at close range,” before being killed by a security guard, the manager of the crossing, Alex Chen, said. The Allenby crossing mainly serves Palestinians and foreigners. Israelis are not allowed to use it. An Israeli policeman and soldier patrol the area near the crossing. Ammar Awad/Reuters The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “a terrorist approached the area of the Allenby Bridge from Jordan in a truck, exited the truck, and opened fire at the Israeli security forces operating at the bridge.” “Three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack,” the IDF said, adding that the assailant had been shot dead. The IDF also published a photograph of the hand gun it said was used in the attack. Israeli police spoke of “several casualties at the scene,” and also said the shooter had “been neutralized.” Jordanian authorities said a preliminary investigation had identified the suspect as Maher Diab Hussein Al-Jazi, a Jordanian citizen from Al-Hussainiya in the Maan governorate south of the capital, Amman. Al-Jazi had acted alone, the Jordanian Ministry of Interior said, adding that he had driven over the crossing in a vehicle taking commercial goods from Jordan to the West Bank. It said various authorities were now coordinating the repatriation of Al-Jazi’s body for burial in Jordan. The suspected gunman’s brother Shady Al-Jazi said his family had been surprised by the news, which they learned through satellite television. He suggested his brother’s anger at Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza may have been a motivating factor. “He used to work as a truck driver and would cross (the bridge) often to offload the truck and then return back to Jordan. But his grief over what’s happening to the Muslim nation, seeing all the killing in Gaza, and every one of us who feels passionately for his brethren, this could motivate him,” he told Jordanian news outlet Ammon in an on-air interview. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the shooting, saying the three Israelis were murdered by a “despicable terrorist.” In remarks at the beginning of the weekly government meeting, Netanyahu said Israel was “surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran’s axis of evil.” The Jordanian government also condemned the shooter’s actions, with the foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah saying the country rejects and condemns “violence and targeting civilians for any reason.” However, the ministry also hinted there was a link between extremism and Israel’s actions in Gaza and the West Bank, calling for moves “to address the root causes and de-escalate tensions” and noting Jordan’s efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. The incident comes almost two weeks after Israel’s military launched one of its most expansive operations in the West Bank in years, carrying out raids, bulldozing highways, and launching airstrikes in multiple parts of the occupied territory.

Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images Clashes in the West Bank have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. Israeli troops and settlers have killed nearly 700 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. All three land crossings between Israel and Jordan were closed following the attack, the Israel Airports Authority said. On Monday, the Yitzhak Rabin crossing connecting Jordan to Eilat and the Jordan River crossing connecting Jordan to the occupied West Bank reopened to passenger traffic, according to the AIA, which said both would open to cargo traffic from Tuesday. The Allenby Crossing remained closed Monday but is expected to open to passengers only from Tuesday. All Jordanian drivers who were questioned following the incident have since been released, and over 100 trucks have returned to Jordan, Jordanian authorities said. Jordan became the second Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel in 1994. It has been highly critical of Israel’s military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Jordan is a close ally of the United States, from which it receives substantial military aid."

The Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said three emergency workers were killed in the attack as they tried to contain a fire in the town of Froun, Nabatieh district. It said the attack was the second time an ambulance team had been targeted within 12 hours and was a violation of international law. However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike had “eliminated terrorists” from the Amal movement, a Hezbollah-allied Shia group. The Amal movement released a statement saying two of its members had been killed “while performing their humanitarian and national duty in defense of Lebanon and the South.” Hezbollah said in a statement Sunday that its fighters “bombed the Kiryat Shmona settlement” with a salvo of missiles in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, singling out the airstrike that killed the three emergency workers. The IDF said early Sunday that about 50 “projectiles” were launched from southern Lebanon toward Kiryat Shmona in upper Galilee, Israel’s northernmost territory. Most were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, it said. The Israeli military said Sunday its air force struck Hezbollah military structures overnight in the areas of Aitaroun, Maroun El Ras, and Yaroun in southern Lebanon. It also said it struck and “eliminated terrorists” from the Amal movement in the area of Froun. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati characterized Saturday’s deadly airstrike as “a blatant violation of international laws and a blatant aggression against human values,” and called on Western ambassadors and other international representatives to attend an emergency meeting at his headquarters in Beirut on Monday. CNN Related article Northern Israeli students face uncertain school year as conflict with Hezbollah persists He said the meeting aimed to demand accountability and “pressure the Israeli enemy that does not care about any law and continues to ignite the fire of its crimes against Lebanon and the Lebanese.” Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. Lebanon’s Civil Defense director Brigadier General Raymond Khattar extended his “deepest condolences” to the families of those affected. He also wished a “speedy recovery” to one of the injured men, whom the Civil Defense identified as Mohammad Amasha. The injured man had been “transferred to Tebnin Governmental Hospital, where he is undergoing surgery due to a serious injury he sustained as a result of the raid,” the Civil Defense said."

Sign up here. Khirbet Karkur, Israel CNN — In southern Israel’s Negev desert, residents of the Bedouin village of Khirbet Karkur live in tents and metal-clad makeshift homes. Not far from the border with Gaza, they hear the sounds of the war unfolding next door . There are some 300,000 Arab Bedouins living in the Negev. As Muslim-Arab citizens of Israel, many are still struggling to find their place in Israeli society 75 years after the Jewish state was established , despite many of them serving in the military. The war with Hamas has only deepened that sense of uncertainty. Bedouins living near the Gaza border feel they have been doubly victimized: first by being within striking distance of Hamas rockets with minimal protection, and second by state marginalization that has only grown worse since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. The village of Khirbet Karkur is not recognized by the Israeli state. Residents live a semi-nomadic life, in an open desert area and in dwellings that aren’t connected to the Israeli electricity grid or water supply. Like many other unrecognized villages, it has no schools or hospitals, and residents say that women have been forced to give birth in cars on the way to hospital because ambulances struggle to reach the town.

Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system often skips interceptions above their village, residents say, as it ignores projectiles that aren’t expected to fall in population centers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN it is “not possible to provide details on the aerial defense array policy due to considerations of information security.” BEER SHEVA, ISRAEL - AUGUST 28: 52-year-old Israeli captive Qaed Farhan al-Qadi, whose rescue from the Gaza Strip was announced by the Israeli army on Tuesday is welcomed with elation by his relatives in Karkor village of Beer Sheva, Israel on August 28, 2024. (Photo by Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu via Getty Images) Mostafa Alkharouf/AnadoluGetty Images Related article Frail and malnourished, rescued hostage hopes war in Gaza ends ‘for all Palestinian and Israeli families’ Villagers say the rest of the country had all but forgotten them – until last week, when a swarm of journalists travelled along dirt roads to the dusty village to mark the release of 52-year-old Farhan Al-Qadi from Hamas captivity. Khirbet Karkur is his hometown. Al-Qadi was abducted along with 250 others by Hamas-led militants on October 7. He was taken from Kibbutz Magen, where he was working as a security guard, and was rescued last week from a tunnel in Gaza by Israeli security forces, the Israeli military said. Speaking to reporters the day after his rescue, Al-Qadi said he wishes “that the war ends for all Palestinian and Israeli families.” Israeli officials have said that Al-Qadi’s kidnapping and release shows that all its citizens – Jews and Muslims alike – are equally vulnerable to terrorism, adding that the state is committed to securing the freedom of every citizen. Israel’s Bedouin community is considered a subset of the country’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population in the country of 10 million. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Al-Qadi the day he was released, and according to a transcript supplied by the Prime Minister’s Office, said: “I want you to know that we do not forget anyone, just as we did not forget you. We are committed to returning everyone, without exception.” Video Ad Feedback Israel rescues 52-year-old hostage held by Hamas in Gaza 02:23 - Source: CNN In November, the prime minister visited the IDF’s so-called Bedouin battalion in the Negev, a unit mostly made up of Muslim Bedouin soldiers, saying that “Jewish and Bedouin commanders are standing shoulder-to-shoulder,” and that “our partnership is the future of us all against these savages.” But some Bedouin leaders and residents of Al-Qadi’s village say the state is celebrating his rescue without taking proper action to address the community’s decades-long needs. Waleed Alhwashla, a Bedouin member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said that while Netanyahu and his coalition portray Israeli Arabs as equal to Jewish citizens, the reality on the ground is starkly different. “Netanyahu lies to the families of the hostages, to the world, he lies at negotiations, to (US President Joe) Biden and to America,” Alhwashla told CNN. “He cannot change the reality inside (Israel), where there are violations of freedom, human rights, the rights of the Arab minority,” he said. ‘Displacement and segregation’ The semi-nomadic Bedouin group is predominantly tribal, with family trees that extend into Gaza and Egypt’s northern Sinai. Many identify distinctly as Bedouin Israelis, while others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. Unlike most Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to do so anyway, often in specialized units operating in the Negev desert. Bedouins who join the military receive support from the state to complete high school studies, Hebrew courses and driving lessons. Some also join up to protect the land they live in, Israeli media reported , especially after October 7. Most Bedouins live in the 4,700-square-mile Negev, which before Israel’s founding in 1948 was home to some 92,000 Bedouins. Only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war that followed.

Oren Ziv/AFP/Getty Images Today, over 300,000 Bedouin citizens of Israel live in the Negev, including more than 80,000 who reside in unrecognized Bedouin villages, according to Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel. Many of those settlements predate Israel’s founding. These villages are often situated next to waste dumps, with little access to water and electricity, said Fayez Sohaiban, a relative of Al-Qadi and former mayor of the nearby Bedouin city of Rahat. “This is a humanitarian issue,” Sohaiban told CNN, adding that all Bedouin families in the Negev suffer the same challenges. “They don’t have schools, they don’t have water, they don’t have power.” “People are suffocating,” he said. Residents of unrecognized villages regularly face demolition orders for their buildings due to lack of building permits, they say. Demolitions have occurred on a “weekly” basis this year, according to the rights group Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality (NCF). In the first half of 2024 alone, 2,007 Bedouin structures were demolished by the state despite a temporary halt in the early months of the war, the group said, up from 1,767 demolitions during the same period of the previous year. Bedouin residents and leaders say their plight has worsened since the war started. Alhwashla, the lawmaker, told CNN that the government has “erased” the village of Wadi Al-Khalil during the war, adding that there are “thousands of other orders for demolition” currently in place. A man points to a hole in the roof of a building caused by a projectile that injured seven-year-old Bedouin girl Amina in her unrecognized village, in the southern Negev desert, in Israel on April 14. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images In May, Amnesty International said that Israel had demolished 47 homes in the unrecognized village of Wadi al-Khalil “without proper consultation or compensation,” adding that Israeli authorities have over the years “employed numerous pretexts to push for the displacement and segregation of the Bedouin community in the Negev,”  from expanding highways and industrial zones, to establishing forests for the Jewish National Fund and the designation of military zones. A report by the NCF said in the case of Wadi al-Khalil, the demolition was justified by the Israeli state as necessary for the extension of Highway 6, “a project not yet scheduled for construction nor budgeted by the state, despite the humanitarian crisis it caused.” Bedouin-Israeli communities are also among the poorest in the country, with close to 80% of Bedouin children living below the poverty line, NCF said, citing data from Israel’s National Insurance Institute. Their plight has worsened significantly since a far-right government came to power in 2022, residents told CNN. In August of last year, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir attended the demolition of an unrecognized village near Tel Arad in the Negev, Israeli media reported . The minister called the demolition “sacred work,” and said the residents should “understand that we govern here, that there are landlords in this country.” Some villagers are afraid to criticize the government, citing fear of retribution by the authorities, which they say has increased since October 7. Villagers say authorities closely monitor their social media for any signs of support for Palestinians in Gaza, or criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war. United Nations officials have repeatedly called on Israel to stop demolishing homes and property belonging to the Bedouin community. CNN has reached out to Israel’s Land Authority for comment. Victims of October 7 When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 22 Bedouins were killed, seven of them by rocket fire that fell onto unrecognized villages, according to Alhwashla. A total of eight Bedouins were kidnapped, according to the Hostage Families Forum. Three have been freed, one is believed to be dead in Gaza, one was killed by IDF fire while attempting to flee, and three remain in Hamas captivity, according to the forum. In April, when Israel and Iran traded direct fire for the first time, a 7-year-old Bedouin girl in the Negev was severely wounded by shrapnel from an intercepted missile, according to Israeli officials. Last week, residents of unrecognized Bedouin villages filed a petition with the High Court of Justice “demanding that the state provide protective measures against rocket and missile fire,” according to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , a partner to the petitioners. Ali al-Zayadana, the brother of Youssef and the uncle of Hamza, two Beduin men who were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, prays for them in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, in Jerusalem on March 22. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images “Approximately 85,000 residents of these unrecognized villages lack any means of protection against rocket, missile, or drone attacks,” the association said, adding that residents have since October 7 been forced to rely on “makeshift protective measures, such as sheltering under bridges, digging trenches, or finding narrow crevices in the ground.” “These villages are without sirens, Iron Dome coverage, or any formal state-regulated protection, due to their unrecognized status,” the association said, citing the petition. The IDF told CNN that “the Home Front Command maintains regular contact with the heads of local authority, the Ministry of Social Equality, and the Bedouin Administration to ensure optimal protection whenever possible,” adding that since the beginning of the war, “the Home Front Command has been working to deploy protective measures in the Bedouin dispersal areas.” Still, Bedouin communities feel that such efforts have done little to alleviate their longstanding hardships. Despite their Israeli citizenship, they feel underrepresented, neglected and that their plight has even worsened as the war grinds on. When members of the international community visit villages of the Negev, they are shocked to see citizens of Israel living this way, Sohaiban told CNN. “We hold the Israeli passport and Israeli ID card. We live in this country and respect the law, so we must be treated the same way Jews are treated,” he said. CNN’s Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting."

Witnesses describe widespread destruction of infrastructure, severed water and electricity supplies, and people rationing food for fear of going outside. It has been the deadliest period in the West Bank since November, according to the UN. The military withdrew from Jenin and Tulkarem on Friday, according to residents. But an Israeli security source said that “the overall operation in Jenin is not over, it is only a pause.” Though the war in Gaza has attracted most attention, Israel’s military has persistently and increasingly brought unsparing military tactics to the West Bank. Israel’s security forces on August 28 launched what they dubbed a “counterterrorism operation” in Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, in the northern West Bank. It has come to be known as Operation Summer Camps. “We will not let terrorism in Judea and Samaria raise its head,” the head of the Israel Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said during a visit to Jenin over the weekend, using the biblical names for the West Bank commonly used in Israel. Residents say Jenin has been left transformed and scarred. “It felt like Gaza,” 36-year-old Lina Al Amouri said by telephone from Jenin. She and her husband fled several days into the IDF incursion, but went back when they heard rumors that the operation had quieted.

Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images “When we returned yesterday, we saw that all the streets were destroyed,” she said. “Soldiers were everywhere, continuing to bulldoze everything around them, not just the streets.” “We heard many gunshots, and then we received news that my mother-in-law’s nephew had been shot seven times near the camp. They let him bleed until he died and prevented ambulances from reaching him.” The IDF has previously said that it often must impede ambulances to check for militants. Eight children killed Nearly 700 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah and the UN, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. Since the Israeli operation began last Wednesday, 39 Palestinians have been killed, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah reported. Among them were at least nine militants, according to public statements from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Eight children have also been killed according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Tawfiq Qandeel, 85-years-old, from eastern Jenin, had gone several days on meagre rations last week, too frightened to leave his house, his son Arafat told CNN. He left home on Friday to get food and attend Friday prayers. On his way back, Arafat said, he was gunned down in the street, where he lay for hours as he bled out.

Nasser Nasser/AP A video posted online Sunday by the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows his corpse lying in the nearly unrecognizable moonscape of a street. An Israeli armored personnel carrier trundles down the road – and over the dead man’s leg. In a statement to CNN, the IDF acknowledged that while disarming improvised explosive devices, security forces shot and killed “an individual approaching their position,” and that the incident was under review. “As the troops were departing the scene, an IDF vehicle inadvertently struck the deceased’s body,” it also said. The military said that it “deeply regrets any harm caused to civilians.” The Israeli military has severely restricted access to the city since its operation began, so international media have had to rely on residents, local journalists, and social media video for independent information about the operation. Journalists this week said that they were fired on by the Israeli military during a raid in Kafr Dan, near Jenin. Mohammed Mansour, a journalist for WAFA, was injured when the car he was driving was struck by gunfire, according to video of the aftermath and his employer. Armored bulldozers also daily used heavy duty plows to tear up roads. The military says this is necessary to unearth improvised explosive devices planted under the tarmac. But the tactic has caused significant infrastructure damage, leaving many roads impassable. The UN says that since October, Israeli authorities have “destroyed, demolished, confiscated, or forced the demolition” of 1,478 structures in the West Bank. Jenin’s mayor said that more than 70% of his city’s critical infrastructure has been destroyed. While deadly ground raids in the West Bank were a regular occurrence before Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack, air strikes – though not entirely unheard of – were extremely rare. When in July 2023 Israel used a drone to launch airstrikes as part of a large operation in Jenin, it made headlines around the world. Not a single Palestinian in the West bank was killed by an air strike in the preceding three years, according to the UN. ‘Don’t play with us’ Since October, such strikes have become a near-daily occurrence. And their use has dramatically ramped up in recent weeks. The UN says that of all deaths by Israeli air strikes since October, nearly a third came in August alone. “No place in Palestine is safe, not just Gaza,” Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan said during a visit to Jenin on Thursday – the first time a Palestinian official visited the city since Israel’s operation began. “We witness the occupying enemy repeating the systematic destruction I saw before, targeting both human life and infrastructure.” Brigadier General Nitzan Nuriel, who ran the counter-terrorism bureau of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office until 2012, and now serves in the reserves, said that Operation Summer Camps was launched to send a message to Israel’s adversaries. “The message to the other side is, ‘Don’t play with us. Don’t think that if we are very much down in the south and probably we are going to be busy up in the north, we will not be able to take care of what’s going in Judea and Samaria.’” The Israeli military, Halevi said during his visit to Jenin, will go “city to city, camp to camp, with excellent intelligence, very good operational capabilities, very strong aerial intelligence support, and above all, with very moral and determined soldiers and commanders.” Palestinian paramedics help to evacuate residents during an Israeli military operation in Tulkarem, West Bank, on Wednesday. Nasser Nasser/AP Duha Turkman, 18 years old, sheltered with her sister at an aunt’s house for a week when the operation began, too scared to go outside because of the Israeli snipers they saw on surrounding rooftops. “We tried to conserve food as much as we could,” she said. “We were eating very little, had no water, and no electricity.” Suddenly, on the seventh day, Israeli soldiers burst through their door, she said. A video taken by Turkman shows shrapnel pockmarking the stairwell of the house. They soon fled to an uncle’s house elsewhere in the city. “When we look at Gaza, we realize that we have been going through this for nine days, and it is already incredibly difficult for us,” she said. “We can only imagine what the people in Gaza are enduring. The situation here mirrors Gaza with airstrikes, bulldozing, and it doesn’t seem like the situation will change anytime soon.”"

But the US can’t walk away.,"For months, the United States has chased a mirage — a deal to free hostages in Gaza, to end the agony of Palestinian civilians there and to pause the fighting between Israel and Hamas.","Sep 6, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Stephen Collinson,Middle East,"CNN — For months, the United States has chased a mirage — a deal to free hostages in Gaza, to end the agony of Palestinian civilians there and to pause the fighting between Israel and Hamas. But its goal has never looked more remote, and the Biden administration has rarely been more estranged from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks and the start of the Israeli onslaught on Gaza. When an administration repeatedly predicts a foreign policy goal is in sight but fails to deliver, as this one has, it risks shattering its credibility and looks like it’s botched one of its top priorities. Politically damaging scrutiny is inevitable over why the Biden administration squandered capital on an apparently hopeless goal and how it misjudged the situation so badly. President Joe Biden’s team faces all these negative consequences and its exposure is especially acute because it now appears to be operating in a different reality from Netanyahu. Washington argues that a deal is nine-tenths of the way to completion after diplomacy involving the US and Qatar, while the Israeli leader denies it’s anywhere near close. Why the US can’t walk away The motivations that led the administration into this vicious circle of failure haven’t changed. So Washington can’t give up. Biden is under even greater pressure to secure the release of Americans believed to be held in Gaza following Hamas’ murder of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a US-Israeli citizen among six hostages whose bodies were found Sunday. For instance, even a tiny chance of a deal, which could spare other hostages, would have huge human consequences. The administration’s fervent desire to prevent a spillover regional conflict also means that ending the war remains imperative. The White House has political as well as humanitarian motives in ending the slaughter of Palestinian civilians. Anger over those casualties, especially among progressives and Arab American voters this fall, could threaten the election hopes of Vice President Kamala Harris in the key swing state of Michigan, for instance. Biden’s decision to end his reelection bid introduced a new and personal dimension of the Middle East crisis for the president. If no ceasefire takes hold in the next few months, he’d face the prospect of handing his successor a failure that would help shape his legacy. One top Democrat close to the White House told CNN’s MJ Lee that Biden had redoubled his focus on the Middle East since shelving his campaign and was “obsessed” with the issue. US officials are not yet at the point of acknowledging there may be no deal before the president leaves office. But the top Democrat said: “We’re stuck,” adding that “both parties are very dug in.” Despite its frustration, the White House has not yet used all possible leverage on Netanyahu – and probably won’t. Biden is a deeply pro-Israel president and has so far been unwilling to bow to progressive demands to restrict US arms sales to Israel to force Netanyahu’s hand. And the prospect of the US walking away from Israel and publicly blaming the impasse on an Israeli prime minister — in a way that would open it to accusations of siding with terrorists — still seems unthinkable. The fraught political circumstances are also one reason why, despite Harris’ willingness to use stiffer rhetoric toward Netanyahu, it’s hard to see her engineering a breach with Israel as one of her first major foreign policy moves if she becomes president. Netanyahu plays politics at home and in the US The showdown between Israel and Hamas is so complex because of the historical, ideological and political factors swirling around the negotiations. Both sides believe they are in an existential battle against the other. Each might believe they are winning and so they don’t want to back down. Meanwhile, the outside political factors that could force their hands have not yet reached a critical point, and third powers have been unable to create that pressure.  The incentives for Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, as horrific as those calculations may be, currently lean toward not ending the war. Bad feeling between Washington and the Israeli government spilled over when Biden on Monday said Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure the release of the hostages and after a senior administration official said later this week that 90% of an agreement had been completed. This was seen by the White House’s Republican critics as an unacceptable attempt to build pressure on Israel. Netanyahu’s latest justification for not doing a deal center on his refusal to pull troops out of land in southern Gaza known as the Philadelphi Corridor, which he says is critical to Hamas’ capacity to maintain its arms supplies. But more broadly, he says that US perceptions that a deal is near are false. “It’s exactly inaccurate. There’s a story, a narrative out there, that there’s a deal out there, that’s just a false narrative,” Netanyahu said on Fox News Thursday. He insisted that Israel had agreed to several proposed deals but that Hamas was the obstacle. “They don’t agree to anything: Not to the Philadelphi Corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jailed terrorists, not to anything.” (Reports this summer said Netanyahu also scuppered earlier deals). His appearance on Fox demonstrated Netanyahu’s long penchant for playing in US domestic politics to pressure the Biden administration at a time when Republican nominee Donald Trump is blaming Harris for the death of the hostages. There are suspicions among many Democrats that Netanyahu is prolonging the war in the hope that Trump — who delivered almost everything he wanted in his first term — could soon be back in the Oval Office. Disagreements rumbled on between the US and Israel Thursday. White House national security communications adviser John Kirby insisted it was sound to say 90% of a deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the US and Arab states, was done. “You call that optimistic, I call that accurate,” he said. The US and Netanyahu’s positions are not necessarily contradictory. It’s possible for most of an agreement to be accepted and only 10% of sticking points to remain. There are familiar echoes here: The parameters of a US-Israeli final status deal on statehood have long been known — at least until recent bursts of settlement building in the West Bank — but there has never been the political will between credible leaders on both sides to make the extraordinarily hard political decisions to solve outstanding questions. And even if a deal is agreed in the Middle East, the implementation can be even more problematic that the negotiation. Sinwar and Netanyahu have other motivations But the prospects that this agreement could finally get over the line still seem grim. Netanyahu has left no doubt that he sees the war against Hamas as part of a wider struggle against Iran and its proxies that is existential to the state of Israel and the Jewish people – a position that means he’s considering far more than push for a deal with Hamas. While he has come under extreme political pressure from families of remaining Israeli hostages to do more to get them out — notably in the resumption of street protests in recent days — the opposition to his continued premiership has not reached a critical mass necessary to topple him. Many analysts believe Netanyahu wants the war to continue to put off the inevitable inquests on how the worst terror attack in Israel’s history took place on his watch. And Netanyahu would be more vulnerable to fraud and bribery charges and trials that he’s facing if he’s out of office. And his ruling coalition — the most right-wing in Israeli history – has held up, raising questions about whether the Biden administration properly assessed his prospects for survival and the possibilities of what is politically realistic. Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, told Jim Sciutto on CNN Max on Wednesday that the key number in Netanyahu’s mind was not the tens of thousands of Israelis protesting him on the streets — but 64. “That’s the number of seats that his coalition controls and there is absolutely no indication on the part of any of the parties that they have any stake in fracturing that coalition,” Miller said. “The reality is that there is no urgency on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu or Yahya Sinwar to either let those hostages go or to redeem them through a negotiation.” In an odd way, Netanyahu and Sinwar’s situations are reinforcing the deadlock. The killing of the hostages bolsters Netanyahu’s narrative that it’s impossible to negotiate with Hamas. But the consequential public protests in Israel build the political pressure on Netanyahu that Sinwar wants to see. And the Hamas leader has shown no sign that he’s motivated by a desire to spare Palestinian civilians — his organization embedded its military infrastructure and tunnels in civilian areas of Gaza. And the more civilians who die, the greater international opposition crests against Israel, which is also in his interests. It’s hardly surprising then that there is still not agreement. The cycle of utter futility was inadvertently underscored by Harris in a CNN interview last week in which she refused to commit to an arms embargo against Israel. “We have got to get a deal done. … We have to get a deal done. This war must end and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done,” Harris said. “We have to get a deal done. We have to get a deal done.” Her repeated insistence on the need for a deal mirrored months of administration statements. But that deal never gets done."

American officials, with Qatar and Egypt, have for months worked to broker a deal to bring an end to the nearly year-long conflict. Those negotiations have taken on new urgency following the killings of six hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and American officials have said they are preparing to present a “final” offer to the parties soon. It’s not the first time over the past several months that US negotiators have described the talks as entering their end stage, only for hopes to be dashed. That’s a reality US officials have acknowledged in recent days. The painstaking negotiations have prompted the families of the remaining Americans held by Hamas to press the White House to explore a separate agreement with Hamas that would secure the release of their relatives. So far, US officials have said they are focused only on the larger deal. A senior Biden administration on Wednesday offered one of the most detailed looks yet at key elements of the negotiations, which spokespeople for the US government said they would not negotiate in public. The official offered the previously unreported details after repeated public statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casting doubt on his potential willingness to accept a deal, despite claims by the US that he had agreed to a “bridging proposal.” The agreement itself makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters on a call on Wednesday. Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the corridor is vital to Israeli security. “The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press. That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said. “In my view, the less that’s said about particular issues, the better,” the official said, adding: “Staking out concrete positions in the middle of a negotiation isn’t always particularly helpful.” In the agreement being discussed for the first phase of a deal, Israel Defense Forces are supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza. In the second phase, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from Gaza. The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal. Hamas said this week that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in. Still, the talks remain ongoing on finalizing the 18-paragraph proposal that American officials believe is the best chance of securing the hostages’ release. Of the 18 paragraphs, all but four are finished and agreed to, the official said. “We still see this deal, this very complex but necessary arrangement, as really the most viable, perhaps the only viable, option for saving the lives of the hostages, stopping the war, bringing immediate release to Gazans, and also making sure we fully account for Israel’s security,” the official said. It’s essentially down to the prisoner exchange and the deployment of Israeli forces, the official said. The deal on the table currently includes the release in the first phase of some 800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including some serving life sentences, the official said. They would be released for the remaining female, elderly and wounded or sick hostages, which was believed to be around 30. Yet Hamas has proved to be a frustrating negotiating partner of this issue, the official said. “There was some progress on last week but is difficult and requires Hamas to engage on it. Otherwise you just can’t move forward,” the official said. Frustrated by the progress of the talks, some families of Americans still held hostage by Hamas have asked the Biden administration to look into a deal that would go around Israel to secure their loved ones’ release. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the families virtually over the weekend. While not ruling out such a possibility, US officials have stressed this week that the broader deal is the best, and potentially only, viable option to secure the hostages’ release. “We are working on a proposal that would release all the hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that we’ve been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same proposal that the president met with his team over the weekend to discuss. That is what we’re working on,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday. The broader deal being discussed carries a significant aid component that would be launched immediately once the first phase goes into effect. As part of the deal, 600 aid trucks a day would be allowed into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Equipment to clear rubble, supplies to support internally displaced Gazans and provisions for rehabilitating infrastructure would also be included in the first phase of the three-phase agreement. Although the negotiators are working to close the remaining gaps, it is unclear when the in-person negotiations will resume. The latest round wrapped up last week. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier Wednesday, “We want to get this proposal developed as soon as possible and get it over to Israel and Hamas and then try to get a final agreement.” This story has been updated with additional information."

The IDF has said that its operations in the West Bank are necessary “in order to remove immediate terror threats in real time.” Humanitarian groups have accused the Israeli military of using disproportionate force against Palestinian residents, inflicting severe damage on critical infrastructure and disrupting health care services. On Tuesday, a UN spokesperson warned that Israeli forces are using “lethal war-like tactics” in the occupied territory, with people being killed, injured and displaced – and have blocked critical access to aid organizations.

We were trapped for a few minutes before we managed to get away.” Israeli forces have killed 33 Palestinians in the West Bank, including six children and two elderly people, since launching the operation last month, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.

Sign up here. CNN — With its announcement that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in, Hamas signaled the opening of a chilling new chapter in an already brutal war. Seizing on a spasm of public outrage in Israel at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inability to bring home the remaining hostages, Hamas released a comic book-style image of a kneeling figure threatened with a gun﻿, followed by a video of Eden Yerushalmi, 24, a bartender at the Nova music festival and one of six hostages who Israel says were shot at close range in Hamas captivity last week before Israeli forces could reach them. Video Ad Feedback 'I am asking for your forgiveness': Netanyahu speaks directly to hostage families 00:31 - Source: CNN In a cruel twist of timing – the funerals of the slain hostages had taken place on Sunday and Monday – Hamas said it would drip-feed footage of what it described as the “final messages” of the remaining five. It released a second video on Tuesday, featuring Ori Danino, a 25-year-old who was abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7. Danino had helped other festival-goers escape the horror. It was not clear when any of the footage was filmed – nor whether it was intended that the videos would be used in this way. Hamas’ new tactics – which Yerushalmi’s family say amount to “psychological terror” – will further fan the fury in Israeli society. For the past three days, crowds have swelled in multiple Israeli cities, with protesters blaming Netanyahu for, in their view, sacrificing Israeli citizens to stay in power, as right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down the government should he end the war. After a general strike that brought the country to a near halt on Monday, thousands of protesters took to the streets again on Tuesday, with demonstrations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, Haifa, Herzliya and Ra’anana. In Tel Aviv, some of the largest crowds gathered outside the Begin Gate of the Kirya – the military headquarters – where a site had been set aside for demonstrators including families of hostages to gather. Video footage showed fires on the street, police attempting to extinguish the flames and protesters waving flags and demanding the release of the hostages held in Gaza. Police said later they had arrested three people suspected of rioting. Yet, it remains far from clear whether such public demonstrations of anger will compel Netanyahu to change Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza. Some analysts say that unlike earlier in the war, Hamas may no longer believe that keeping hostages gives it leverage over Israel.

It knows that this current Israeli administration is not interested in any kind of hostage release deal,” Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN. “I don’t think they consider them as substantial playing cards any longer.” In a statement Monday evening, Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida said the new instructions had come into place after an “incident” in Nuseirat, seeming to refer to an Israel Defense Forces operation in June that rescued four Israeli hostages from a refugee camp in central Gaza. The raid, which killed 274 Palestinians, occurred mid-morning when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. Some of the captors were killed, and the IDF successfully retrieved the hostages unharmed, further weakening Hamas’ leverage in negotiations with Israel. Since then, the IDF has rescued one more hostage – Farhan Al-Qadi , 52, a Bedouin Israeli citizen who was retrieved from a tunnel in Gaza last week. When Hamas took some 250 people hostage from southern Israel on October 7, “they thought they could try to leverage them for a prisoner exchange deal,” Mustafa said. Although an exchange deal was struck as early as November, no further agreement has been reached 10 months later. Video Ad Feedback Protesters flood Israel’s streets to demand ceasefire 02:39 - Source: CNN A ‘watershed’ moment The successful rescues may have helped Netanyahu to argue that Israel’s twin war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages can be pursued simultaneously, making the cries for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal less urgent. But, after the murder of the six hostages under Hamas’ new directive, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday to demand Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free the hostages, in one of the largest demonstrations since the war began. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand. Instead, a defiant and bellicose Netanyahu used his first public comments since the discovery of the bodies to double down on his strategy in the strip. He said Israel will retaliate strongly against Hamas for the killing of the six hostages, hinting that the response would be akin to the strike against Hezbollah in July that killed the Iran-backed group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr. He stressed again his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeated his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a new sticking point threatening once again to derail talks to reach a deal. Video Ad Feedback Cousin of hostage killed by Hamas: Netanyahu's decisions made it impossible for hostages to return 03:04 - Source: CNN Although Netanyahu has refused to cede ground under growing pressure, analysts say the killing of the six hostages by Hamas has been a turning point, leading many in the country to ask whether Israel is reaching the limits of what its military power can achieve, and whether its offensive may be endangering the more than 100 hostages from the country still being held in Gaza. “The penny that dropped for a lot of Israelis is that going after Hamas is not complementing the return of the hostages. It is hindering and hampering the return of the hostages,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst and lecturer at Reichman University in Tel Aviv, told CNN. “It became very clear that the presence of the IDF played a direct part in the decision of their Hamas keepers to kill them,” he said. “The sense that the Netanyahu government is incompetent, that Netanyahu is doing all of this for his own reasons, is now much more powerful for a lot of people. So I think it is a watershed moment.” Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum and former senior adviser to the late Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said many Israelis have felt two waves of grief over the past three days: first, for the death of the six hostages, and then, following Netanyahu’s speech, “the realization that Netanyahu is determined to pursue an open-ended occupation of Gaza.” Protesters block a road in Tel Aviv on Sunday as they demand the release of hostages held in Gaza. Ariel Schalit/AP New red line The death of the six hostages also caused the latest spat between Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to reports in Israeli media, the two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any ceasefire deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) stretch of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. Although Netanyahu has recently begun to strongly insist that Israel maintain a military presence in the corridor for security reasons, Hamas has long been clear that the proposal is a non-starter. Gallant reportedly told Netanyahu that insisting on this condition means “there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.” Regardless, the cabinet proceeded to vote on the plans Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, with Gallant the only dissenter. Novik, the former adviser to Peres, said the newfound focus on the Philadelphi Corridor is merely symbolic. His “discovery” of the corridor and the effective elevation of its status to a holy site “has no security merit,” Novik said. If anything, an occupation of the corridor – which runs alongside densely populated towns and cities – risks endangering Israeli troops, as Israel’s previous occupation of the territory that ended in 2005 showed, Novik warned. “They’re sitting ducks,” he said. “And if Hamas managed to kill our troops in 2004 before it had the kind of munitions and equipment that they have today, the results are going to be even more devastating.” Netanyahu stands before a map of Gaza during a news conference in Jerusalem on Monday. Ohad Zwigenberg/AFP/Getty Images Since the issue of the corridor was raised last month, Hamas has said it will not agree to Netanyahu’s red line. “At this point, they cannot accept anything short of the demands they are now calling for: A complete cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops,” Mustafa said. “If they were to accept anything short of what they’re demanding, that would be political suicide for the movement.” Netanyahu’s defiant speech on Monday may have extinguished hopes that the killing of the six hostages could lead to a change in course. Former IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, who has become more critical of the government since leaving his post earlier this year, said about the remaining hostages after Netanyahu’s speech: “He sealed their fate.” The insistence on maintaining troops along the corridor may also spell further tension between Israel and the United States, which has throughout the months-long negotiations insisted that Israel must fully withdraw from Gaza after the war. When asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, President Joe Biden said simply: “No.” CNN’s Mohammed Tawfeeq, Tamar Michaelis, Lauren Kent and Hira Humanyun contributed reporting."

More than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, are still being held in Gaza – the vast majority of them taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive The scenes outside the Israeli leader’s homes culminated a day of anger that brought much of the country to a halt, following a call by the country’s largest labor union, known as Histadrut, to shut down the “entire” economy. Flights in and out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport were also stopped for two hours. But in a press conference Monday evening, the Israeli leader struck a note of defiance, batting away criticisms – including from US President Joe Biden – that he is not doing enough to secure a deal. He asked for “forgiveness” from the families of the six hostages for failing to bring them back alive, but insisted it should be Hamas that “has to make the concessions.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a news conference in Jerusalem on September 2, 2024.

Hamas meanwhile escalated its own threats on Monday, with a public warning that more hostages held in Gaza would return “inside coffins” if Israel attempts to free them militarily. A statement released by the militant group said that its fighters guarding prisoners held in the Palestinian enclave had received “new instructions” on how to deal with hostages if Israeli forces get close, and released an illustrated poster apparently showing hostages threatened with a gun.

Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images Monday saw the largest general strike to have taken place in Israel since March 2023, when there was a similar mass walkout over Netanyahu’s controversial attempts to overhaul the country’s judiciary. According to union Histadrut, hundreds of thousands of Israelis joined the protests Monday, just a day after half a million took to the streets on Sunday for what protest organizers said was one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas. Israeli police said they had seven demonstrators in Tel Aviv for “violating public order and disrupting traffic.” ‘Netanyahu has made it impossible’ Netanyahu’s defiant stance following the discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown further doubt on the negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. Even before the killing of the six hostages, the talks had become bogged down, with one key disagreement centering on control of a border area known as the Philadelphi corridor. Netanyahu says control of the 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it. However, the deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas in the ceasefire talks, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. “Hamas doesn’t want us to be there and that’s why I insist on being there,” the Israeli leader said on Monday. During a cabinet meeting over the weekend, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of the corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.” The relative of one of the hostages who was shot dead in southern Gaza also blamed Netanyahu and his stance on the corridor for their deaths. Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat, told CNN that the Israeli government “cold-bloodedly” crossed a “red line” by prioritizing the corridor over the lives of the hostages. “We know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point, and Israel was the one putting on more and more terms and actually postponing the deal,” Dickmann said on Monday. “Right now, we know the decisions that our Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it impossible for Carmel and other hostages to return and put their lives in great danger, and that’s what killed them.” But on Monday, even as he acknowledged dissent within his cabinet, Netanyahu doubled down. “We’re not going to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu told a press conference on Monday evening. “The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi corridor. We need to have it under our control,” he said. Disagreements over the corridor are only one of the splits within the cabinet over the conduct of the war that have become increasingly public and rancorous in recent months, reflecting deep divisions at the top of Israel’s government. Just on Monday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was using his power to prevent a “reckless deal” and ensure “that there will be no negotiations at all.” He was speaking to members of Gvura, a right-wing organization representing the families of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza. But American officials described new urgency in reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said while meeting the families of Americans held hostage that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas. Alongside the strikes, the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the six hostages found dead, was held in Jerusalem on Monday. Speaking at the ceremony, Jon Goldberg-Polin said he hoped his son’s death would be “the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages.” “Hersh, we failed you. We all failed you. You would not have failed you. You would have pushed harder for justice,” he said. “You would have worked to understand the other, to bridge differences.” “The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing,” Goldberg-Polin said. “You were a really great guy. I love you.” Strike hits public services, schools As well as an impact on flights, some Israeli municipalities said they joined the strike, including Tel Aviv and Haifa, according to a list from the Histadrut outlining who joined the action as well as statements from some of the cities.

The captives, including an Israeli American , were among the more than 200 people taken by the militants into Gaza following their deadly cross-border rampage on October 7. Five of them were taken from an Israeli music festival where hundreds were killed and dozens more were kidnapped by Hamas fighters. The sixth was captured from a nearby farming community, according to the Hostages Families Forum, which has coordinated efforts to highlight the plight of the captives and their families, and push for their release. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said their bodies were found in a Hamas-run tunnel under the city of Rafah, and that they were “brutally” murdered “a short while” before troops were able to reach them. The location was approximately one kilometer (0.6 miles) from the tunnel where another hostage was rescued alive days earlier, an IDF spokesperson added. Three of the six hostages whose bodies were recovered were expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of the “humanitarian category” based on the framework Israel and Hamas agreed to in early July, the officials said, with one of them adding: “Our Prime Minister delayed it.” Here’s what we know about the hostages: Hersh Goldberg-Polin Courtesy Goldberg-Polin family Hersh Goldberg-Polin The 23-year-old Israeli American became one of the most recognizable faces of the enduring hostage crisis, after he was taken at gunpoint by Hamas militants from the Nova music festival. Banners and murals demanding his return were often displayed in Jerusalem and around the world. When Hamas gunmen poured into southern Israel on October 7, Goldberg-Polin and his friends were forced to hide inside a small bomb shelter. As the militants began to lob grenades into the bunker, Goldberg-Polin rushed to throw them out, before his arm was blown off from the elbow down, according to a firsthand account from his friend. Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin, have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. They have also regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages and gave an emotional address at this month’s Democratic National Convention.

Testimonies indicate that Lobanov helped evacuate people at the festival and ran with five others into the Be’eri forest, where he was later captured by Hamas gunmen. Lobanov is survived by his wife and two children, a two-year-old and a five-month-old. His younger child was born while he was in captivity.

Be’eri was one of the hardest hit communities in the October 7 attacks with Hamas killing 101 of its residents, including children. Thirty people were abducted from the kibbutz that day. After 50 days without a sign of life, Gat’s family received testimony from returned hostages, who described her as their guardian angel.

Little wonder Saturday’s discovery of six hostages killed in Gaza has Israelis’ blood boiling. The nation feels on a cusp of a major turning point. Gripped by swelling protests and labor union strikes, the weeks ahead for Israel are unpredictable. These well-tested democratic tools of change have toppled governments before, but it’s best to remember that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a political survivor extraordinaire. Even now, Netanyahu and the hard-right nationalist members of his cabinet are working to shut down the legal protests and strikes through a court order, that seemed in the short term at least to have been successful. Yet despite the outcome being unclear, this tumultuous moment has been building for months. Galvanized by growing frustration waiting for Netanyahu to cut a deal with Hamas to bring home from Gaza the 101 remaining hostages, including 35 who are believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Prime Minister’s officer, it is Hamas, not surprisingly, that appears to be having a decisive say. Its leader Yahya Sinwar exploits every weakness in Netanyahu he can manipulate, the most potent of which is vulnerability to public opinion as Israel prepares to mark the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and some 250 others kidnapped and taken to Gaza. Protesters in Tel Aviv on September 1 block a road, calling for a deal for the immediate release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas militant group. Ariel Schalit/AP His moves may be calculated to weaken Netanyahu’s resolve, and they’re having a predictable impact. Unlike Palestinians in Gaza, Israelis can rise up to challenge their leadership. Late-night skirmishes between protesters and the authorities Sunday on Tel Aviv’s usually hyper-busy eight-lane Ayalon Highway were a manifestation of that. As flames and dense smoke engulfed wooden pallets and tires on the roads, I watched a young man, blue paint spray in hand, scrawl his message to the prime minister in foot-high letters on the roadside wall: “Hostages or revolt.” Nearby, two teenage girls speaking in well-articulated English told me they’d never been to a protest before, but the deaths of Goldberg-Polin and the five other hostages compelled them to come tonight. When I asked if they thought the protests would change the Netanyahu’s mind, without missing a beat, both told me they doubted it. It is a question gripping the nation, not least because the writing on the wall here has been wrong before. For many the protests and strikes cover well-trodden ground, tilted in favor of the government. Even Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s public condemnation of Netanyahu’s negotiating tactics, emotively calling him a “disgrace,” revisits previous rifts within the government.

Nir Elias/Pool/AFP/Getty Images Last year Netanyahu fired Gallant, for breaking with the government over highly contentious judicial reforms, before rehiring him shortly afterwards. The difference is that now, Gallant and the country are fighting several wars: Hamas in the south; a hostile enemy, Hezbollah, on their northern border; an alleged terror threat in the West Bank; not to mention a still unpaid threat of retaliation by Iran for the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran a month ago. Netanyahu’s multi-fronted challenges, like with so many spinning plates, need constant juggling. His unprecedented coalition cabinet is bounded by extreme-right nationalists, Security Minister Itmar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Above all others in his unruly cabinet, they are the pair who routinely threaten to collapse his coalition if he is seen as softening on Hamas. They owe their outsized influence to him, and would lose it if they topple him. Protesters fill a street in Tel Aviv, Israel, on September 1.

Bringing down Netanyahu would shoot them in the foot. It is why they are at the forefront of shutting down the strikes and protests. At the protests Sunday, as horseback police muscled their powerful mounts toward the crowds, many shouted to them: “We are not against you as individual police, only your boss Ben Gvir.” A measure of potential change will be how brave protesters feel against police emboldened by court orders Ben Gvir seeks to crack down on them and labor unions. How united the country’s potentially powerful unions remain in the face of government pressure to keep the country running will also show which side has the momentum.

Ilia Yefimovich/picture-alliance/dpa/AP So much is in the balance right now. Netanyahu’s short video message Sunday blaming Hamas for the death of the six and stalled hostage negotiations is indicative of his efforts to hunker down and limit damage to him. His unmatched political survival skills have kept him in office through bigger protests before, and few will be willing to bet he is about to throw in the towel now. The question is, how long can he hold on for? More days like Sunday, with the nation at the febrile intersection of heartache, frustration and anger, will challenge Netanyahu like never before. He is not just up against his usual enemies, the country’s liberal left, but in a fight-to-the-death tangle with the Hamas leader, who has made it clear that he is prepared engage in moments of unimaginable brutality to get what he wants. For Israel, the outlook is bleak: the chances of a cathartic hostage freedom moment are fading, along with Netanyahu’s political fortunes."

Anger at Netanyahu – who has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters – reached a boiling point Sunday as protesters responded in fury to the news that another six captives had been found killed in Gaza. Israel’s largest labor union called for a general strike on Monday and threatened to shut down the “entire Israeli economy.” The extent of the strike early Monday was not yet clear but supporters have vowed a national response. Three of the six hostages found dead, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had been expected to be released in an eventual ceasefire, Israeli officials told CNN. Autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning; Israeli forces announced the recovery of their bodies from an underground tunnel in Rafah on Saturday. The details of their deaths fueled anger that was palpable across the country as protesters blocked highways, waved Israeli flags, and chanted, “we won’t abandon them” in reference to the more than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, being held in Gaza, according to data from Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The vast majority of those hostages were taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive. In Tel Aviv, a group of protesters stood behind a mock cemetery while holding signs saying “named after Benjamin Netanyahu,” as they cast blame on the prime minister for the  deaths of the hostages. Later in the evening, police threw stun grenades at protesters blocking the Ayalon highway in the city, according to video verified by CNN. Naama Lazimi, a member of Israel’s parliament who was present at the demonstration, said on X that stun grenades “were thrown toward both sides where the demonstrators were standing in complete surprise and without any advance warning.” Israeli police also fired foam from a water cannon at protesters on the highway – prompting demonstrators to chant, “Officer, who are you keeping safe?” Police use water canon during the protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Tomer Appelbaum/Reuters Police arrested 29 people in the city, accusing them of vandalism, disorderly conduct and attacking officers. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said at least 700,000 people took part in protests across Israel, with an estimated 550,000 of them in Tel Aviv. CNN cannot independently verify the figures and has asked Israeli police to provide an estimation of the crowd size. In Tel Aviv, crowds were visibly emotional; many shouted “sorry” as the names of the six hostages were recited on a loudspeaker during the protest, which organizers said was the biggest since the start of the war. One protester told CNN said she was there to show support for her cousin, whose body was repatriated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) overnight. “I’m here every week, I wanted to show her father and other parents that we are here for them,” she said. “And on the other side, we’re incredibly angry at the government. What they’ve been doing is unforgivable.” In Jerusalem, protesters called for Netanyahu to resign as the government held a cabinet meeting. Eden Kramer, who attended the rally with a toddler in a stroller, said she was also demonstrating for the child’s future. “We hope everyone will come out today to bring a message to the government: We can’t keep up like this anymore,” she said. Protesters fill a street in Tel Aviv, Israel, on September 1. Or Adar Deal thrown into question The discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown negotiations for a deal into question. Skepticism has mounted over Netanyahu’s willingness to strike one given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far-right coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal. During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of a key border area known as the Philadelphi corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.” The Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7 mile) stretch that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. Netanyahu says control of the corridor is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it.

Gili Yaari/NurPhoto/Getty Images Gallant, who has increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned his colleagues Sunday that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.” He added, “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time.” A senior US official said the killings of the hostages called into question how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal as three of them were set to be released as part of the ceasefire agreement. “US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) and a number of the hostages who were just executed,” the senior US official said Sunday. “This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally.” A source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN it wasn’t clear how the killings would affect the discussions, adding that the impact will likely be seen in the next day or two. The “situation is complicated,” the source said. There are currently no in-person joint negotiations with the parties, but the source said discussions continue through the regular channels. US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House. ‘In a downward spiral’ Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has asked the country’s attorney general to request urgent injunctions to prevent the planned nationwide strike on Monday. In a letter addressed to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, Smotrich argued that a strike would hurt the economy during wartime and set a dangerous precedent. The attorney general’s office has not yet commented on the request. He had earlier instructed the finance ministry’s salary department to pass on a directive that anyone who joins the strike on Monday will not be paid. The chairman of Israel’s largest trade union, known as Histadrut, warned on Sunday that the country was “in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags.” Arnon Bar-David, who called for the strike, told a press conference that “only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down.” He added that the strike would include the shutdown of Ben-Gurion Airport. In a statement, Ben-Gurion Airport said it would be “open for flights and landings on Monday, September 2.” The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said it would join the strike, which it described as a “response to the tragic news of the murder of our student Carmel Gat, along with five other Israeli hostages.” Gat, a 40-year-old occupational therapist , was taken by Hamas from her parents’ home in the border kibbutz of Be’eri in southern Israel on October 7. A spokesperson for the university said the shutdown would be more extensive than previous measures taken since the beginning of the war, such as a partial strike in June.

Israeli soldiers found the six bodies in tunnels under the enclave, according to the military. The hostages were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Sunday. The development has sparked protests across Israel, with fresh public anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet for failing to secure a hostage deal. Israel’s largest trade union has also called for a nationwide strike starting Monday. Three of the six whose bodies were recovered had been expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of a “humanitarian category,” based on a framework agreed by Israel and Hamas in early July, the officials said. “Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.” The ordeal of California native Goldberg-Polin , who was taken at gunpoint at the Nova music festival on October 7, led to him becoming one of the faces of the devastating international hostage crisis that has challenged Netanyahu’s leadership and triggered widespread destruction in Gaza. The parents of 23-year-old Goldberg-Polin have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. Their tireless and high-profile campaigning saw them meet with world leaders, and earlier this month, give an emotional address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

The Israeli military named the other three victims as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov and Ori Danino. CNN is reaching out to their families. In a taped message Sunday, Netanyahu said he had been shocked to the core by what he said was “the terrible cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages.” He also stressed that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.” He said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas, and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December. “Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 – we agreed, and Hamas again refused.” He added that the Israeli government and he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.” In response, the Hostages Families Forum, a volunteer-based organization that represents relatives of those held captive, criticized the Prime Minister, calling on him to “stop blaming everyone” and to “take responsibility” for his alleged failures. “Take responsibility for the thwarting (of a deal). Take responsibility for the neglect. Take responsibility for the hostages who were murdered in captivity,” the Forum demanded in a statement. The Forum also said Netanyahu had ignored the views of the security establishment in insisting on conditions in the negotiations. “Hamas is not the only one responsible for the thwarting of the deal. We do not expect the terrorist (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar to want to return the hostages, we expect the Prime Minister of Israel to do everything, everything, everything in order to return the hostages home.” The Forum has called for demonstrations across Israel, while also announcing a vigil honoring the “hostages murdered in Gaza by Hamas” in Tel Aviv at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET). US President Joe Biden said the bodies of the hostages were recovered under the city of Rafah in southern Gaza. “I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House that also paid tribute to Goldberg-Polin’s parents. “They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,” Biden said. “They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.” Video Ad Feedback Hear what the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin said at the Democratic National Convention 08:14 - Source: CNN ‘Anguish and misery’ Goldberg-Polin’s death in particular will reverberate not just in Israel but in US political circles. His parents Rachel and Jonathan have regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages, and their emotional address to top Democrats at the convention earlier this month inextricably tied the hostages’ fate to US policy over the war in Gaza. Rachel Goldberg-Polin told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since her son was kidnapped. At her convention speech, she described life since October 7 as like living on “another planet.” “Anyone who is a parent or has had a parent can try to imagine the anguish and misery that Jon and I and all the hostage families are enduring,” she told delegates. Some of those discovered dead in the tunnels under Gaza this weekend were, like Goldberg-Polin, captured at the Nova music festival. Lobanov, a 32-year-old father of two, and Yerushalmi, 24, were both tending bar at the gathering, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Danino, 25, and Sarusi, 27, were also at the festival. Gat, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. She had been visiting her parents when Hamas militants stormed the community close to Gaza’s border, killing and taking hostages as they went.

Florion Goga/Reuters Anger in Israel News of more hostage deaths piles pressure on Netanyahu as anger inside Israel swells over the failure to strike a ceasefire deal, and as stark disagreements between the prime minister and his military leaders increasingly spill out into the open. A number of protests sparked across Israel on Sunday, with demonstrators’ anger directed at the government’s handling of the crisis. Protests have occurred or are ongoing in Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, Rehovot and Be’er Sheva. In several instances, protesters have blocked roads – demanding an immediate agreement to secure the remaining hostages’ release. The banner at one protest read: “Look them in the eyes.” The chairman of Israel’s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) Arnon Bar-David has also called for a nationwide general strike to begin on Monday at 6 a.m. local time, after holding a “charged and difficult” meeting with representatives of hostage families in Tel Aviv. “I will not tolerate the neglect,” Bar-David stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation of the hostages in Gaza. Histadrut is the country’s biggest labor union. “We are in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags. Only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down,” the labor leader said. The hostage deaths up the stakes for Biden to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict. “Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden said in his statement on Goldberg-Polin’s death. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said “the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces” by the news of the six dead. “On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,” Herzog said in a statement. “We will continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.” Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave. Anger has been growing inside Israel, led by many hostage families who believe Netanyahu and key far-right cabinet colleagues have been stalling on achieving a ceasefire resolution with Hamas that might bring those captured and killed home. Netanyahu has been adamant that a deal can only be signed when Israel’s safety is assured.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images But domestic pressure is building,  with the Hostages Families Forum being among the most critical of the Israeli prime minister. “The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,” the forum said in a statement in English on Sunday. “We call to Netanyahu: Stop hiding. Provide the public with a justification for this ongoing abandonment,” the forum added. Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.” “It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.” The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.

On October 7, he went to the Nova music festival in a rural area near the Gaza-Israel border with his best friend Aner to celebrate his 23rd birthday, according to his mother. “As rockets began to fall Hersh, Aner and 27 other young festival goers took refuge in a 5-feet-by-8-feet bomb shelter. Terrorists began to throw grenades into the shelter, Aner stood in the doorway and repelled seven of those grenades before the eighth one killed him,” Rachel Goldberg-Polin said. Demonstrators at a protest in Tel Aviv on August 31 call for the release of Israelis held hostage by Palestinian militants in Gaza since October.

He was later taken on a truck by gunmen and driven off, eyewitnesses told his parents. Footage taken on the day of that attack showed Goldberg-Polin being marched out of the shelter – with his hand blown off and bone protruding from his wrist – and thrown along with four others into the back of a truck. The first time Goldberg-Polin’s parents saw that video was following an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in October. The pair were recalling eyewitness accounts of how their son was taken into captivity during a live TV interview, when Cooper realized he had heard details of the story before. Days earlier, an Israeli soldier at the site of the Nova festival had shown Cooper the video. During the interview, Cooper realized the young man in the video was his interviewees’ son. Not wanting to spring the news on them on live TV, Cooper contacted the couple after the interview and asked if they wanted to see the video. They later confirmed the man in the video was their son and asked that the video be shared more widely. The latest hostage deaths up the stakes for the Biden administration to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict. It also puts pressure on Netanyahu to agree a deal as fears grow that more captives will die and the ongoing destruction in Gaza could spark a wider regional war. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave. “There is a surplus of agony on all sides of the tragic conflict in the Middle East in a competition of pain. There are no winners,” Jonathan Polin said at the DNC last month. “In an inflamed Middle East we know the one thing that can most immediately release pressure and bring calm to the entire region. A deal that brings this diverse group of 109 hostages home and ends the suffering of the innocent civilians in Gaza. The time is now.” This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

The demands by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum came as thousands rallied across Israel on Saturday demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sign a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. The IDF said in a statement Saturday that it had “located a number of bodies during combat in the Gaza Strip,” but it has not confirmed whether any of the bodies are those of hostages and asked the public to “refrain from spreading rumors.” However, many Israelis have taken the statement to mean that more Israeli hostages have been found dead and it has amplified calls for the government to secure a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave. “Netanyahu abandoned the hostages! This is now a fact,” a statement issued by the families’ forum read. “Starting tomorrow the country will tremble. We call on the public to prepare. We will stop the country,” the statement continued. The forum said it will release more details about what it is calling for on Sunday. US President Joe Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials about the unfolding situation but noted that the bodies had not yet been identified. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.” “It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.” The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

Abir Sultan/Pool/Reuters/File Related article Netanyahu clashes with defense minister over Gaza deal terms, Israeli media reports say The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase. However, the current proposal, if agreed upon, essentially allows Israel and Hamas to abandon discussions after the first phase, and Israel has made it clear that a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire. More than 100 hostages taken from Israel were freed under a temporary truce last year and eight have been rescued alive – including Farhan Al-Qadi , who was recovered from a Hamas tunnel this week. However, more than 100 are thought to remain in Gaza. CNN previously reported that there are 107 total hostages, living and dead, being held in Gaza, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Of that number, 103 hostages are from the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Of those, 33 are presumed dead, according to the forum. This is a developing story and will be updated."

His eyes were glassy, often seeming tired. The Israeli military said Tuesday that Al-Qadi is the eighth hostage to be rescued alive in Gaza by the Israeli military since the beginning of the war – but he is the first to have been reclaimed alive from inside Hamas’ tunnel network underneath Gaza Al-Qadi sat at the center of long rows of plastic chairs, where visitors greeted him with long embraces and kisses on the cheek in a gathering near Tarabin – one of Israel’s many unrecognized Bedouin villages. Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi Hostages Families Forum Related article ‘Brought back to life’: Family hails rescue of Israeli hostage from Hamas tunnel in Gaza With limited power and water services, the village is about 20 miles from the Gaza Strip and is not protected by Israel’s Iron Dome defense system. The closest city is Rahat, which is the largest Arab Bedouin city in Israel. The Bedouin community – a Muslim, semi-nomadic, and ethnically Arab group – is considered a subset of Israel’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population. While some identify as Bedouin Israelis, others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. Unlike Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to volunteer, often serving in specialized units like the Gadsar 585 , known as the Bedouin battalion, which operates in the Negev desert, where most Bedouins originate. ‘Isolated alone’ From the village, CNN’s team on the ground could hear heavy strikes and impacts from the nearby Gaza Strip. Fayez Sohaiban, Al-Qadi’s relative and the former mayor of Rahat city, said the former hostage had lived in captivity not knowing what his fate would be the next day, and food “was almost nonexistent.” Al-Qadi was working as a security guard in Kibbutz Magen when he was taken 11 months ago. He told reporters on Wednesday that he spent a lot of his time in a tunnel, and had not seen the sky for eight months before his rescue. He added that he did not meet other hostages during his time in Gaza. “No one, no. Not once,” his brother, Juma’a, said, adding that Al-Qad was “isolated alone” the entire time. Ali El-Ziyadne, whose brother and nephew were also kidnapped on October 7 and remain in Gaza, joined the Bedouin community to welcome Al-Qadi home. His brother, Youssef Ziyadne, and nephew, Hamza Ziyadne, have been held hostage by Hamas for 11 months, he said. “We are afraid for their lives. We don’t know anything about them,” El-Ziyadne told CNN, adding that Youssef suffers from diabetes. El-Ziyadne said he pleaded several times to Hamas that they release his relatives, who are Muslim, hoping to appeal to the group’s “Islamic values and humanity.” El-Ziyadne asked about his brother and nephew when he met Al-Qadi, but the former hostage did not see them, he said. Bedouin Israeli former hostage Al-Qadi, whose rescue from the Gaza Strip was announced by the Israeli army on Tuesday, is welcomed by his relatives in Karkor village of Beer Sheva, Israel, on August 28, 2024. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images/File Before Israel’s founding in 1948, the Negev was home to 92,000 Bedouins, but only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war of that year, according to Minority Rights Group . Those who stayed “were treated harshly, uprooted time and again and forced to live in reservations,” the international human rights organization said. Today, Bedouin in the Negev still struggle to exercise basic human rights to water, shelter and education, according to Minority Rights Group, which blames Israeli authorities for withholding essential services from Bedouin villages it does not recognize. Tens of thousands of Bedouin live in such villages, where they face the threat of home demolition, eviction or forced displacement, the group estimates. According to the National Library of Israel , there are almost 250,000 Bedouins, many of whom live in towns that are yet to receive recognition from the state, while others live in unincorporated villages. Al-Qadi’s rescue means there are now 103 hostages from the October 7 attack being held in Gaza, according to figures from the Israeli prime minister’s office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Last week the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from Gaza during an overnight military operation in Khan Younis, Israeli authorities said. Hopes of a ceasefire-for-hostages deal, which would halt fighting in Gaza and see the return of people held by Hamas, have repeatedly been raised and dashed in recent months. Negotiators are continuing to work on a deal, and have met with increasing intensity in recent weeks. Talks made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the discussions in Cairo, Egypt, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement. An Israeli delegation is expected to head to Doha on Wednesday for ceasefire talks.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/middleeast/gaza-who-humanitarian-pause-intl-latam/index.html,Israel agrees to pauses in fighting in Gaza for polio vaccination,"Since the war, Gaza’s near-universal polio vaccine coverage has dropped to just over 80%, potentially endangering thousands of children.","Sep 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Tara John,Middle East,"CNN — Israel has agreed to a series of pauses in fighting in Gaza in September to allow young children in the enclave to be vaccinated for polio, according to United Nations and Israeli officials. The polio campaign, which will aim to vaccinate around 640,000 children across Gaza, comes after the highly infectious virus was found in sewage samples in the Strip in June. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative for the West Bank and Gaza, told a press briefing from a video link Thursday that the pause would start September 1 and will be split into three 3-day phases. “We have a preliminary commitment for area-specific humanitarian pauses during the campaign,” he said, adding that the pauses will roll out first in “central Gaza for three days, followed by south Gaza and then followed by north Gaza.” The vaccination drive comes as aid agencies reported Israeli attacks on their convoys. One charity said an Israeli strike on a humanitarian vehicle in Gaza killed several employees of a transportation company. The Israeli military said it targeted “armed men” who had taken over the convoy. The return of polio to Gaza is a measure of the destruction wrought by more than 10 months of Israeli bombardment. Polio vaccine coverage in the enclave was estimated at 99% in 2022, but had dropped to below 90% at the start of this year, according to WHO data. Peeperkorn warned that more than 90% coverage was needed to stop the outbreak. Abdul Rahman is the first person in Gaza in 25 years to be diagnosed with polio. CNN Related article Polio vaccines are coming to Gaza, but for this baby boy, its first case in 25 years, they’re too late The virus mostly affects children under five years old, and can cause irreversible paralysis and even death. It’s highly infectious and there is no cure; it can only be prevented by immunization, WHO says. More than 2,000 health workers have been recruited in Gaza to take part in the ambitious vaccination campaign. So far, 1.26 million doses of vaccines have been delivered to the Strip, with 400,000 more on their way. An Israeli official confirmed to CNN that polio vaccinations will begin in Gaza on Sunday. Each phase of the vaccination campaign is expected to take around seven hours, and during those hours, the vaccines will be able enter the area on “pause” and be distributed. Vaccinations will begin in the central Deir Al-Balah region from September 1 to 4, then in the southern Khan Younis region from September 5 to 8, and in Gaza City and northern Gaza from September 9 to 12, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah said. The ministry also published maps showing the locations of each vaccination center. A source familiar with the vaccination rollout told CNN that the major challenge will be whether IDF soldiers on the ground honor the pauses in fighting. There are concerns that they will not, the source said, adding that the IDF’s standard operating procedure is to go after a Hamas target no matter what. Hamas knows about the pauses and is expected to take advantage of them to move critical personnel and assets. The work now is to make sure the Israeli soldiers know that they cannot engage militarily during the pause, the source said. Very little is known about the epidemiological profile of this strain of polio – the working assumption is that 500 people in Gaza are carrying it, the source added. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said two doses of vaccine will be given in two rounds, four weeks apart – suggesting that further pauses may be arranged later. Peeperkorn warned, however, that due to the damage to roads, infrastructure and the constant displacement of people caused by Israel’s assault, “conducting the campaign for just three days in each area is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve adequate vaccination coverage.” A worker unloads a shipment of polio vaccines through the Karm Abu Salem crossing at a Gaza health ministry depot, on Sunday. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, said the militant group welcomed the push for a pause in Gaza to implement the vaccination drive. “We are ready to cooperate with international organizations to secure this campaign,” he added. Earlier this month, Abdul Rahman, an 11-month-old boy, was diagnosed with the disease – Gaza’s first recorded case of polio in 25 years. His mother, Niveen Abu al-Jidyan, told CNN how her child went from feverish and vomiting to partially paralyzed. “My child started to move and crawl at an early age. But suddenly everything went backwards. Suddenly, he was no longer crawling or moving or able to stand on his feet or even sit,” she said. “He will be one next month. He should be walking by now, but he suddenly stopped moving.” Israel’s offensive not yet relenting Ahead of the expected pauses, Israel’s offensive in Gaza has continued. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had carried out an airstrike on a humanitarian aid convoy in Rafah, which it claimed had been taken over by armed men. Anera, the US-based charity that organized the convoy said several employees of the transport company it was working with were killed in the strike. Sandra Rasheed, Anera’s country director for Palestine, told CNN the convoy was carrying medical supplies and fuel to the Emirati Red Crescent hospital in Gaza and condemned the “shocking incident.” The IDF said it launched the strike after it had confirmed “that only the vehicle of the armed men could be attacked,” adding that the Anera employees had reached their destination “safe and sound.” A photo released by World Food Program shows multiple bullet pock marks in the drivers’ side window; in total, at least ten bullets hit the vehicle, according to the agency. World Food Program Related article World Food Programme halts movement in Gaza after repeated gunfire strikes aid vehicle In a later statement, Anera said four Palestinians had been killed in the airstrike. No Anera staff were injured but one of its employees, in the second vehicle of the convoy, witnessed the incident at close range. Anera said that shortly after the convoy left the Kerem Shalom crossing, “four community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security” with the transport company had asked to take command of the first vehicle, “citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted.” The NGO said the Israeli airstrike had been carried out “without any prior warning or communication.” In a separate incident, the World Food Programme (WFP), which delivers aid throughout the Strip, said on Wednesday it is halting the movement of its employees after one of its vehicles, which it said was “clearly marked,” was targeted with repeated gunfire just meters from an Israeli checkpoint. On Friday, US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations said an Israeli investigation into the attack had found it was caused by a “communications error.” CNN has asked the Israeli military for more information. Kate Phillips-Barrasso, the vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian group, told CNN Thursday that the success of the Gaza polio vaccination campaign “rests on real and reliable guarantees of safety — ones that have not been provided by the parties to this conflict over the last ten months.” “Put simply, Gaza has become the most dangerous place in the world to be a child or a humanitarian worker,” she said. Three-day periods ‘might not be enough’ WHO representative Peeperkorn said that as the three-day periods might not be enough to reach all those targeted, it “has been agreed, when needed, the campaign will be extended by one day per zone, or even more when necessary.” The Hostages Families Forum, which campaigns for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, has also asked the WHO and the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, to include the hostages in the ongoing polio vaccination campaign and all other health interventions. A United States official told CNN that Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in their meeting last week on the polio vaccinations, telling Netanyahu it had to be a top priority and it had to get done. Netanyahu agreed to work with the US on the details, the official said. US Special Envoy Lise Grande for Middle East Humanitarian Issues has been leading that effort, working to finalize the details between the Israeli government and the UN, including what the pauses would like and how the vaccines would be delivered. WHO is joined in the vaccination effort by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and other partners. Each organization has been assigned a role in the technical and strategic “microplan” to execute the vaccine campaign. For weeks, the organizations have emphasized that some kind of ceasefire — what they are calling a “polio pause”— would be crucial to the effort’s success, and even to contain the disease from spreading to the broader region.

The IDF posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday that people who had been ordered to leave three neighborhoods of Deir Al Balah in central Gaza could go home. CNN interviewed a number of families who had returned to find scenes of destruction. One man, Abdulfattah Al Bourdaini, said: “We came home and found nothing, no power, no gas, no house, and we cannot change our clothes.” All he had been able to salvage was a teddy bear for the son he hoped one day to have. “I am penniless like the day I was born,” Al Bourdaini said. “I have nothing. I came to check on my house, didn’t find a house or anything, nothing is left… There is nothing left to cry about.” His brother, Musa Al Bourdaini, surveyed the scene in disbelief, telling CNN: “Why would they want to destroy this house? This house could have housed 120 people… What did they do to the house? They didn’t find a single human being in it, but yet they hit it with missiles and destroyed an entire neighborhood.” A worker unloads a shipment of polio vaccines provided with support from UNICEF to the Gaza Strip through the Karm Abu Salem crossing at a depot belonging to Gaza's health ministry on August 25. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images Related article Israel agrees to pauses in fighting in Gaza for polio vaccination He said he had come home with a key to his own, neighboring building – but had found no house for it. “Now we will bring a tent, that is if we find a tent, and put it next to our house,” he added. Several people said they had been displaced from the neighborhood about 10 days ago, when the Israeli military posted on X and dropped leaflets telling people to evacuate the area for their own security. Many Gaza residents have been displaced multiple times since October, worsening the ongoing humanitarian crisis; experts also warn that evacuation orders have complicated aid efforts. In its post on X on Thursday, the IDF said that “following the operations against terror organizations in the (Deir Al Balah) area, the IDF is enabling the return to these blocks which are part of the designated Humanitarian Area.” On Friday, the IDF announced that people in three more blocks in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza could also return home, saying on X: “‎After the IDF’s activities against terrorist organizations in the area, you can return to these blocks. In the meantime, the humanitarian zone will be adapted and those areas will from now on be classified as part of the humanitarian zone.” In a statement Friday detailing its operations in recent weeks, the Israeli military said “troops of the 98th Division have completed their divisional operation in the Khan Younis and Deir Al Balah area, after about a month of simultaneous above and underground operational activity.” Israeli forces had “eliminated over 250 terrorists,” and destroyed terrorist infrastructure including six underground tunnel routes in the course of the operation, the statement said. “In some of the tunnel routes the troops eliminated terrorists and located terrorist hideouts and weapons.” The Israeli military has told residents of some Gaza neighborhoods that they can return home but many have found scenes of destruction. Mohammad Al Sawalhi/CNN Abdul Raouf Radwan said that he and his family had moved into a tent closer to the coast to escape the bombardment. They had returned hoping to reoccupy their home, “hoping to find a life, find something, find a room to live in,” he said. “We found nothing but destruction. Our dreams were destroyed, our memories were destroyed… The house that our ancestors built was all gone.” His brother, Muhammad Ramzi Radwan, said he had already lost a son as a result of the Israeli military’s operations. “A young man of 30, who built himself up from scratch, education, marriage, a son. All is gone, nothing is left.” “My message is to stop the war,” Radwan said. “There is no time left to rebuild ourselves… We have endured this. This is beyond our capacity.” Yamen al Tabi’s house was also destroyed. He said the family had left the neighborhood out of fear and returned to find their home completely ruined. “I wish I had been buried in the house. I wish I had died in the house and not returned and seen the scene that I saw,” he told CNN. “Where will we go now without shelter?” Raouf Ayesh said he and his children had taken refuge in tents. “And we said, ‘Oh God, let us return to our homes and find our belongings, our clothes, our winter clothes.” But they returned to nothing but debris. Ayesh appeared to place some of the blame on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. “Let Sinwar be satisfied,” he said. “Can you hear? They ruined us. We were not like this.” Some Palestinians returning to devastated neighborhoods say they can only try to salvage what they can from their former homes. Mohammad Al Sawalhi/CNN Hanan Al-Arabeed, a widow who had returned to her home with her children, found it in ruins. “Should I go to a tent I am now in the street, I have two disabled children. I did not take anything with me from my house, there is total destruction as you can see,” ﻿she said. Al-Arabeed had harsh words for Arab governments, saying: “We demand that the Arab countries stand with us, they make us feel that we are not Muslims…. The negotiations are at whose expense? At the expense of the martyrs, at the expense of the blood of children that is wasted.” Her sister, Umm Kareem Al-Arabeed, said she was collecting whatever she could from the ruins of her apartment. “Unfortunately, Israel has made its decision to eliminate the Gaza Strip. Indeed, it wants to eliminate the Palestinian people so that they do not raise their heads from here for 100 years. But you know, we are a steadfast people, coping people,” she said. “We will start from the beginning and anew. We will start over,” she added. Nearly 84% of the enclave has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war, according to the United Nations’ main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, UNRWA. All the while, the Israel-designated “humanitarian zone” has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis."

The two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor , a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, according to CNN affiliate Channel 12, the Times of Israel and other outlets. The Philadelphi corridor is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. According to multiple accounts, Netanyahu produced maps showing how the IDF should remain in the corridor during the first phase of the deal – in which hostages are also meant to be released – so as to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels under the corridor. “I would like to bring the decision on the IDF troops remaining in the Philadelphi Corridor for the Cabinet’s approval,” Netanyahu is reported to have said. Gallant interjected, according to the accounts of the meeting, saying: “The significance of this is that Hamas won’t agree to it, so there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.” Mohammad Al Sawalhi/CNN Related article ‘Nothing is left’: Israel’s military tells Gaza residents to go home but they find only rubble He also alleged that Netanyahu had drawn up different maps to those preferred by Israeli negotiators in Cairo, adding: “You imposed these maps on them.” Netanyahu angrily rejected the claim, but Gallant persisted. “Of course you forced (it). You’re running the negotiations on your own. Since you disbanded the War Cabinet, we hear everything after the fact.” Gallant appeared to receive support from the Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi, who was at the meeting. He is reported to have said that the IDF could withdraw from the corridor and return “at the end of six weeks of ceasefire. There are enough constraints for negotiations, there’s no need to add another one.” According to published accounts, Gallant said at one point that “the prime minister can indeed make all the decisions, and he can also decide to kill all the hostages,” provoking rebukes from other ministers. He added that “30 lives are at stake.” Gallant added that “in the end Sinwar will dictate to you and you’ll retract,” a reference to the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who is thought to be in hiding in Gaza. Netanyahu in response reportedly insisted that no one dictated to him, saying that “only determined negotiation will make him (Sinwar) fold.” The cabinet proceeded to vote on the maps that Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, the only dissenter being Gallant. The right-wing National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir abstained from the vote. Israeli media cited sources close to him as saying he opposed any gradual decrease in the number of soldiers in the corridor. An Israeli official told CNN on Saturday that they were unable to comment on the maps presented to the meeting but confirmed Netanyahu asked the cabinet to hold a vote on forces remaining in the Philadelphi corridor. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum responded to the media reports of the meeting with a statement that they “should cause every Israeli citizen to lose sleep.” West Bank incidents Reports of the dispute between top Israeli officials emerged as violence continues to rock the Israeli- occupied West Bank . Two security incidents happened overnight on Friday, in which two men were shot dead and a vehicle exploded, according to the IDF.

Here’s what to know The IDF said that a vehicle caught fire and exploded late Friday at a gas station at the Gush Etzion intersection. “Forces that arrived at the point shot and killed the terrorist who got out of the vehicle and tried to attack them.” The IDF said that nearby, “terrorists tried to run over a security guard at the entrance to the settlement of Karmei Tzur,” a settlement north of the city of Hebron. One of them was killed. The IDF said there had been several casualties in the two incidents. The Israeli emergency services (MDA) said that shortly before midnight it received a report of two gunshot victims near the gas station. The victims were moderately injured with gunshot wounds. The MDA said that a vehicle apparently breached the entrance to the Karmei Tzur community. The head of security at the settlement received minor injuries when pursuing the vehicle, according to the IDF, and “during the confrontation, an explosive device in the terrorist’s car detonated.” The Palestine Islamic Jihad movement said its fighters were responsible for the attacks and claimed without offering evidence that a number of Israeli soldiers had been killed. The IDF said Saturday that security forces continue searches for additional suspects near Karmei Tzur community. “The initial examination of the vehicle explosion at the Gush Etzion gas station indicated that the incident was an attempted car bombing by a terrorist,” it said. Several soldiers had received light or moderate injuries, it said. The Israeli army blocks all entrances to the city of Hebron on Saturday. Mamoun Wazwaz/Anadolu/Getty Images The incidents come amid a substantial Israeli operation in the West Bank over the past few days which the IDF has said is targeting militants preparing attacks on Israel. In the north of the West Bank, Israel’s military is continuing its offensive in Jenin city and refugee camp for a fourth consecutive day, Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Saturday, citing local sources. It said eyewitnesses claimed Israeli military reinforcements had been deployed to the Jenin refugee camp and raided several homes. “Israeli military bulldozers have been destroying streets and infrastructure in both the city and the refugee camp, causing significant damage to electricity and water networks,” WAFA reported. Videos obtained by CNN on Saturday appear to show Israeli military bulldozers digging up streets in Jenin refugee camp on Saturday. The IDF says this is done to find and dismantle explosive devices.

Sign up here. Rosh Pina and Kibbutz Magal, Israel CNN — With one year left until graduation, 17-year-old Ziv Zinger hopes to begin the academic year on September 1 like other students across Israel. But that hope remains uncertain for him and others from the country’s Northern District, who are grappling with the reality of displacement as Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon drags on without resolution. He is among more than a thousand students who, before the October 7 war, attended the Har VaGai Regional High School in the Dafna kibbutz (agricultural commune), less than two miles from the border with Lebanon. The school was forced to shut when Israel ordered border communities to evacuate as the Israeli military and Hezbollah began exchanging fire. Just last month, a rocket burst through the empty school’s gym. Some 62,000 Israelis have been displaced from their homes in the north of the country since the evacuation order almost a year ago. Zinger said he feels “cheated” by not being able to return to his school in Dafna. After October 7, schools shut for a month, he said, after which students spent the rest of the academic year in hybrid learning that alternated between online classes and other school locations. 17-year-old Ziv Zinger looks on during an interview with CNN in the town of Rosh Pina, Israel on August 22. Dan Hodge/CNN “(I) feel very connected to the old school,” he told CNN. Students had access to “grass, a river flowing through the school. It was very open.” Hezbollah said its attacks are in response to Israel’s war in Gaza, which was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has killed more than 40,600 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. The Israel-Hezbollah crossfire extending several kilometers into both countries’ territory, along with the subsequent evacuation order in Israel, has impacted more than 16,000 Israeli students, the country’s ministry of education said.

Aziz Taher/Reuters Related article Israel launches ‘preemptive’ strikes in Lebanon as Hezbollah fires back hundreds of rockets Across the border in Lebanon, where authorities say more than 94,000 people have been displaced, at least 70 schools have closed with around 20,000 students affected, according to UNICEF . The country’s education system was already “on the brink of collapse” before the conflict due to years of being overstretched, it said. As Lebanon faced a crippling economic crisis, public school teachers went on a months-long strike in late 2022, leaving classrooms empty. The war has only compounded the situation. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel started just a day before the Lebanese academic year was to start, leaving schools and teachers unable to find immediate alternatives, Khaled Al-Fayed, an official at the Lebanese education ministry, was cited as saying by Asharq Al Awsat newspaper. The government eventually made arrangements to move students to schools in safer areas and made distance learning available to those who were trapped in their villages. Maysoun Chehab, UNESCO’s chief of education for Lebanon, told The National newspaper however that bad internet connectivity, the lack of electronic devices in some homes and inadequate teacher training are major hurdles for distance learning in the country. Twenty-two children have died in Lebanon from Israeli strikes since October, according to the ministry of health. Makeshift schools in Israel South of Israel’s evacuation zone, makeshift schools are now emerging nearly 11 months into the war as part of an effort to return children to classrooms. In the northern town of Rosh Pina, some 46 kilometers (27 miles) from the Lebanon border, an empty factory is being repurposed to accommodate students of Har VaGai, where Zinger was a student for three years. He’s glad a new school is being built for them, but said it won’t “feel like home.” Spanning some 17 acres, the three-building factory is being revamped to accommodate more than 1,000 students, Ravit Rosental, principal of the school, told CNN. Despite the efforts to move the students to relative safety, fears persist. The makeshift school is outside the evacuation zone but it’s still within range of Hezbollah’s projectiles. It is equipped with 18 external bomb shelters, as well as several safe rooms within each building. “We are afraid. I cannot say that I am not afraid,” Rosental said. Children riding on school buses in the area are at risk of being hit by rockets, missiles, drones or even failed interceptions, she said. “We have a lot of problems on the roads,” she said. Sirens blared across the unfinished school just a day before CNN’s visit, according to Palestinian workers at the site, who showed videos of the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepting projectiles in the sky. Rosental told CNN that she is “not so confident” that the school will be operational by September 1. The war shows no signs of abating. In a fresh round of escalation, the Israeli military launched what it called “preemptive” strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon on Sunday, as the Iran-backed militant group said it carried out its own attacks in response to the killing of a top commander. In a video statement that day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “what happened today is not the end,” while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that further strikes could be carried out against Israel. ‘Russian roulette’ with children’s lives Officials in the north of the country fear their district may never return to normalcy. “We are playing Russian roulette with the lives of our children,” Amit Sofer, the head of the Merom HaGalil Council in northern Israel, told Israeli news outlet Ynet . “There is no protection, there is no security,” he said, adding that “in the current situation, I don’t see the education system resuming on the conflict line.” Pressure has been mounting on the Israeli government to restore security in the north, bring evacuees home and resume the new academic year on time.

Dan Hodge/CNN Far-right ministers of the ruling coalition have been pushing Netanyahu not only to press on with the war in Gaza, but to launch a “ decisive war ” against Hezbollah as well. Some officials in the north share that sentiment. Mayors from the Northern District have threatened to cut contact with Netanyahu’s government unless their demands are met. “For eleven months there has been a security strip within the territory of the State of Israel and the government is silent,” David Azoulay, the head of the Metula settlement council in the north, said in a statement. “Soon, another sad school year outside our homes and the government is silent.” Azoulay said he wanted to see the government “act physically” and “act to remove the threat and return us to our homes.” Hezbollah has vowed to continue attacking the Jewish state until Israel stops its war in Gaza. Israel’s northern front was a point of contention in Netanyahu’s war cabinet before it was disbanded in June. The prime minister had reportedly told the cabinet that September 1 did not have to be the “goal date” to start the school year, according to Israel’s Channel 12. “Why do we keep taking about this date, what will happen if they go back a few months later?” the prime minister reportedly said in response to pressure from former war cabinet member Benny Gantz to stick to the official date, according to Channel 12. CNN has reached out to the prime minister’s office for comment.

Oren Ziv/AFP/Getty Images Related article Israelis fear for hostages as Netanyahu celebrates ‘crushing blows’ against enemies Asked if the school year would resume on time, the Israeli education ministry told CNN that “the Northern District is prepared and ready to receive students and to start the school year as scheduled,” but that “should the security situation worsen, we will issue appropriate instructions to the schools accordingly.” Parents of students who are forced to attend new schools say they hope their children experience a sense of normalcy soon. Meirav Atmor, mother of 12-year-old Matan, said her son is longing to return to school, but that the war brings daily anxieties. “It’s very stressful when there are sirens,” Matan told CNN, sitting next to his mother in their home in Rosh Pina, adding that he has had to learn where shelters are and how to take cover when needed. The war has had a huge effect on both parents and their children, Atmor said. It is “not normal” for a mother to be worried about the impact of war on her son, she said. “It is not a normal reality for a young boy to deal with,” she added. “And that’s sad. That’s very sad.” Zinger, the 17-year-old, said it has been a rough year for him. While previous generations in Israel have experienced war, for many young Israelis like him, it’s a new and unsettling experience. “(For) everyone my age, this is the first real war,” he said, adding that the even younger generation will be forced to grow up “in the reality of war.” “People’s lives have been changed.” CNN’s Dana Karni and Lauren Izso contributed to this report."

The victims were all local Palestinians involved with a transportation company contracted by Anera, according to the organization. They had decided to ride in the lead vehicle for the convoy’s security but had not been cleared by Israeli authorities, it also said. Shortly after the convoy left the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Thursday, “four community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security” with the Move One transport company took control of the lead vehicle, “citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted,” Anera said. The humanitarian convoy’s mission and route had been coordinated with Israeli authorities, however, the Israel Defense Forces said it attacked the lead car because the men inside appeared to be armed – a breach of the agreed plan. “After further confirmation that only the vehicle of the armed men could be attacked, an attack was carried out on them,” the IDF said in a statement Thursday.

Anera has said that the convoy’s transport plan called for unarmed security guards, and that the people who were killed had not been approved in advance. Humanitarian workers typically coordinate their routes with Israeli forces in order to move with relative safety. “The four community members were neither vetted nor coordinated in advance, and Israeli authorities allege that the lead car was carrying numerous weapons,” Anera said. The airstrike, which Anera said was carried out without any prior warning, did not injure any of its staff. One employee, who was in the second vehicle of the aid convoy, “witnessed the incident at close range,” it said. “Despite this devastating incident, our understanding is that the remaining vehicles in the convoy were able to continue and successfully deliver the aid to the hospital. We are urgently seeking further details about what happened,” Anera’s Palestine country director, Sandra Rasheed, told CNN. The mission was carrying carry food and fuel to the Emirati Red Crescent Hospital in the south of Gaza. Anera has coordinated 24 prior shipments for the hospital with the United Arab Emirates since May. The strike comes just days after a World Food Programme convoy was attacked close to an Israeli checkpoint, sustaining “at least ten bullets,” according to the UN agency. The incident prompted the United Nations to lodge a formal complaint with Israel, and the IDF is currently reviewing the incident. A photo released by World Food Program shows multiple bullet pock marks in the drivers’ side window; in total, at least ten bullets hit the vehicle, according to the agency.

The airstrikes hit three cars in their convoy, killing three Britons, a Palestinian, a US-Canadian dual citizen, an Australian, and a Pole. Pressure is mounting on Hamas, which governs Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seal a ceasefire and hostage release deal against the backdrop of severe starvation , dire water shortages , mass displacement and disease in the enclave. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed over 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 93,500 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in the isolated enclave after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli special forces, acting on intelligence, were combing a network of tunnels in southern Gaza when they found Al-Qadi, two Israeli military officials told CNN. Al-Qadi was alone, without his Hamas captors, when Israeli forces found him, one of the officials said. Al-Qadi is the eighth hostage to be rescued alive in Gaza by the Israeli military since the beginning of the war, in four separate operations – but he is the first to have been reclaimed alive from inside Hamas’ tunnel network underneath Gaza, the IDF told CNN. “He was dead and is now brought back to life,” Al-Qadi’s brother, Juma’a, told CNN after Al-Qadi met family members at the Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, where he is being cared for following his rescue. He added that his brother had not expected to come back alive. “It was all tears. Tears of joy. What matters is that we saw him,” Juma’a said during an interview in the Bedouin village of Tarabin, in Israel’s Negev desert. He added that his brother had told him earlier today that his one wish was to “see you (the family) and then die.” CNN Related article Who are the hostages freed during the Israel-Hamas conflict? A friend of Al-Qadi, Mazen Abu Siam described jubilant scenes and a “big celebration” at the hospital, where “hundreds of friends and relatives” had arrived to visit the former hostage. Al-Qadi was discharged from hospital on Wednesday afternoon, the Soroka Medical Center said. In a press briefing, Al-Qadi expressed his gratitude to the soldiers who rescued him and the medical team at Soroka, the same hospital where he was born. Already making use of his new freedom, he said “I got shawarma at 2 a.m.” Family members told CNN he is expected to return to Tarabin on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening, his brothers and 11 children, along with their cousins and neighbors, were busy putting up tents, chairs and lights ahead of his return to the village. In the closed women’s quarters of the village, Al-Qadi’s mother was awaiting her son’s return. Alya El-Sanae said that at first, her family hid the painful truth behind her son’s disappearance, telling her he was traveling. A few months after the October 7 attacks, she was told her son was held by Hamas in Gaza. Today, news of his release felt “unbelievable.” “My heart flew with joy,” El-Sanae told CNN. Gomaa, one of the brothers of the rescued hostage Farhan Al-Qadi, speaks to the media after leaving his brother’s room at the hospital in Beer Sheva. CNN ‘It is hard for him to erase the things he saw’ Juma’a said that his brother had been shot in the leg and kidnapped on October 7, during an attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Juma’a added that his brother’s leg appeared poorly treated and that he was operated on without anesthesia, “as one does with animals.” The 11 months Al-Qadi spent in captivity would never leave him, Juma’a said. “It is hard for him to erase the things he saw there,” Juma’a said, adding that he too would never fully recover from losing his brother for nearly a year. Ata Abu Madighem, the former mayor of the Arab Bedouin city of Rahat in southern Israel, close to where Al-Qadi is from, said he had visited Al-Qadi in hospital. He said Al-Qadi had told him another hostage died next to him at the beginning of his captivity. “He told me that captivity was brutal. Constant darkness, did not see the light of day. He was treated like the rest of the hostages, like an Israeli in every way,” he said. Another one of Al-Qadi’s brothers, Abu Mohammad, suggested to CNN that his captors had fled when they heard Israeli troops approaching the tunnels, saying his brother had heard Hebrew voices and shouted out to communicate his whereabouts. Asked by CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday if he believes Al-Qadi’s captors abandoned him, IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said that was “one of the options that are being looked at.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Al-Qadi, in a conversation released on video by his office. “Farhan, I am so happy to talk to you,” Netanyahu says in the video. I want you to know that we do not forget anyone, just as we did not forget you.” “I’m happy too. I’ve been waiting for this moment,” the former hostage told the prime minister. The Hostages Families Forum, which campaigns for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, celebrated the return of the father of 11. Al-Qadi, right, is pictured in an Israeli hospital with one of his brothers on Tuesday. Channel 13 “(His) return home is nothing short of miraculous,” it said. “However, we must remember: military operations alone cannot free the remaining 108 hostages, who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror.” Protests demanding the Israeli government do more to secure the release of the remaining hostages have been going on for months. Al-Qadi’s friend Abu Siam said he had taken part in some of those protests and that he asked Al-Qadi when he visited him in hospital whether he was aware of the demonstrations. “I asked him if he saw me on the roads and the streets calling to free him from the captivity and he told me his was disconnected from Israeli news,” Abu Siam told CNN’s Jim Sciutto. ﻿Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said a “daring and courageous” operation led to Al-Qadi’s rescue. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was “overjoyed” by the development. ‘Not a single drop of blood was shed’ The Bedouin community in Israel – a Muslim, semi-nomadic, and ethnically Arab group – is considered a subset of the country’s Arab population, which makes up about 20% of the total population. While some identify as Bedouin Israelis, others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. Unlike Jewish Israelis, Bedouins are not required to serve in the Israeli military, though some choose to volunteer, often serving in specialized units like the Gadsar 585 , known as the Bedouin battalion, which operates in the Negev desert, where most Bedouins originate. Al-Qadi’s brother Juma’a said the Bedouin community in Tarabin village was proud that “not a single drop of blood was shed” during Al-Qadi’s rescue. “Not a child, not a Palestinian, not a Jew or anyone shed blood for my brother,” he said. Before Israel’s founding in 1948, the Negev was home to 92,000 Bedouins, but only 11,000 remained after the Arab-Israeli war of that year, according to Minority Rights Group . Those who stayed “were treated harshly, uprooted time and again and forced to live in reservations,” the international human rights organization said. Today, Bedouin in the Negev still struggle to exercise basic human rights to water, shelter and education, according to Minority Rights Group, which blames Israeli authorities for withholding essential services from Bedouin villages it does not recognize. Tens of thousands of Bedouin live in such villages, where they face the threat of home demolition, eviction or forced displacement, the group estimates.

Al-Qadi’s rescue means 104 hostages are being held from the October 7 attack, according to figures from the Israeli prime minister’s office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Of those, 34 are presumed dead. Last week the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from Gaza during an overnight military operation in Khan Younis, Israeli authorities said. Hopes of a ceasefire-for-hostages deal, which would halt fighting in Gaza and see the return of people held by Hamas, have repeatedly been raised and dashed in recent months. Negotiators are continuing to work on a deal, and have met with increasing intensity in recent weeks. Talks made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the discussions in Cairo, Egypt, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday it killed Wissam Khazem, whom it described as the Hamas leader in the city of Jenin, in an exchange of gunfire after he was identified “in a vehicle in the area.” The military said it had found weapons and money in the vehicle. Two others were also killed as they tried to flee the vehicle, according to the Israeli military, naming them as Maysara Masharqa and Arafat Amer. The IDF said both men belonged to Hamas and “operated under the command of Khazem and took part in shooting attacks against Israeli communities.” In a statement, the Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, acknowledged the three men’s deaths and confirmed Khazem was one of its leaders in Jenin. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a network of Palestinian armed groups, said Masharqa was its “most prominent field commanders” in Jenin. As of Friday, 19 Palestinians have been killed during an expansive Israeli military operation in the West Bank that includes the cities of Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarem, according to the Palestinian ministry of health and Palestinian groups. A total of 11 Palestinian militants have been killed in the Israeli operation, according to a CNN count. Of those, five were killed Thursday during an exchange of fire “within and near a mosque” in Tulkarem. The IDF said it had killed Muhhamad Jabber, known as Abu Shujaa, the leader of the local branch of the militant group Islamic Jihad, which later confirmed Jabber’s death. Friday’s firefight came after Israel launched one of the largest assaults on the occupied territory in years. Stressing the need to root out what he called “Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” Foreign Minister Israel Katz called for a Gaza-style operation in the West Bank. Katz warned that Iran was working in the West Bank to establish an “eastern front” against Israel, working alongside its proxies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Israel’s renewed offensive in the West Bank has sparked criticism from senior United Nations and Western officials.

The firefight came after Israel on Wednesday launched one of the largest assaults on the occupied territory in years, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz calling for a Gaza-style operation in the West Bank to root out what he called “Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure.” After Israel mounted further raids early Thursday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said among the five killed in the mosque was Muhhamad Jabber, known as Abu Shujaa, the leader of the local branch of the militant group Islamic Jihad. Jabber had carried out numerous terror attacks, the IDF said, including a shooting attack in the West Bank city of Qalqilya in June, when an Israeli civilian was killed. Later Thursday, the Islamic Jihad announced the “martyrdom” of Jabber, whom they said was the commander of the Tulkarem Battallion of the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the militant group. The four others killed along with Jabber were related to his terror network and one more person has been apprehended, the IDF’s international spokesperson Lt. Col.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet have “defined the destruction of Hamas’ military and governing capabilities” as one of their key aims in Gaza, though the notion was rejected by Israeli Defense Forces Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in June, when he called promises to “make Hamas vanish” outlandish and tantamount to “throwing sand in the eyes of the public.” But that number falls to 49% when the more ambitious goal of dismantling Hamas, the terror group that carried out the October 7 attacks inside Israel, is described as the endgame. The results of the 2024 Chicago Council Survey , carried out in late June into July, and another poll from Council-IPSOS, conducted in mid-August, described the US as closely divided over the American government’s role in Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza, with a narrow majority, 53%, now saying the US should condition that military aid to Israel not be used toward military operations against Palestinians. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas last fall, the enclave’s health ministry announced on August 16. The death toll has risen since then, and, despite optimistic talk from US leaders about a potential ceasefire, Israel announced a new military operation in the occupied West Bank this week, a move that could further broaden the conflict. Overall, a plurality of Americans said the US is “striking the right balance” in its support of Israel (22%) or failing to do enough to support Israel (20%). Three in 10 respondents said the US is “supporting Israel too much.” An additional 27% said they were not sure. The findings were roughly the same when the question focused specifically on military aid. Similar shares of Democrats and Republicans say the US is delivering the right amount of military aid to Israel, at 28% and 29%, respectively. The parties differ over the level of aid the US is providing, with 42% of Democrats saying the US is offering “too much” support, while 34% of Republicans believe not enough is being done. Support across party lines for restricting military aid to Israel remains largely unchanged since a similar question was asked before the October 7 attack – the figure was 52% in September 2023 and 53% in June 2024. Democrats became six points more supportive of restrictions over that period, while Republican support dropped by seven. Republican leaders have on the whole been more aligned with Netanyahu’s government. Former President Donald Trump, who has run hot and cold with the prime minister, called for Israel to “finish the job” in Gaza during his lone debate with President Joe Biden. He has also criticized the Israeli military for “losing the PR war” over the conflict. The GOP rank-and-file are more likely to say US humanitarian aid to Gaza has been delivered at “the right amount” (31%) than Democrats, among whom 44% said “not enough” has been done. Some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have criticized Netanyahu’s conduct. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the new Democratic presidential nominee, have offered slightly different messages about the war. Both are now firmly pushing for a ceasefire, with Biden having declared it was “time for this war to end” in late May. Harris, shortly after Biden dropped out of the presidential race, endorsed Israel’s right to defend itself, but also warned that Americans “cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering,” Harris said, “and I will not be silent.” At the Democratic convention last week in Chicago, Harris once again pledged US backing for Israel, condemned the atrocities of October 7 and insisted that the administration was determined to secure a lasting peace in the region. “At the same time,” she continued, “what has happened in Gaza over the last 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” While about 60% of Americans view the US as playing a generally positive role in “resolving problems in the Middle East,” their views of Israel’s conduct is less generous.  Only 39% said Israel is a positive force. A closer look at American attitudes toward Israel also reveals a significant partisan divide. Nearly 60% of Republicans say Israel is “defending its interests” and that its military’s actions are justified, compared with only 15% of Democrats who said the same. On the flip side, 50% of Democrats told pollsters that Israel had gone too far and acted unjustifiably, while only 14% of Republicans agreed. When combined with independents, there was an even three-way split. Thirty-two percent of Americans said Israel was justified and defending its interests; 34% disagreed, holding that Israel had gone too far; and the final third said they were “not sure.” There is, again, a sharp split on the question of whether Israel’s military is “intentionally targeting all Palestinians, including civilians.” Overall, 46% of Americans believe they are – a number boosted by Democrats, of whom 63% said Israel was not restricting its military actions to members of Hamas. Only 28% of Republicans said the same. US support for an independent Palestinian state, uniting the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has remained steady over the past six years, according to the report, at 49%. But the underlying figures show an increasing partisan divide, with Democrats increasingly backing a state (67%) while Republicans (27%) are now even less likely to do the same. The June 21-July 1 Chicago Council survey was conducted by Ipsos and surveyed 2,106 US adults using a nationally representative online panel. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.3 percentage points."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had launched a large counter-terror operation overnight with the I﻿srael Security Agency (ISA) in the areas of Jenin and Tulkarem in the north of the West Bank. Early indications showed a significant, combined Israeli operation, involving drones and bulldozers, military and security forces, four battalions of the Israel Border Police, and an elite unit of undercover troops. Video obtained by CNN showed bulldozers tearing up a street in a built up area of Tulkarem, and also moving in convoy through Jenin. Additional footage released by Israel’s military showed what it said was a strike on a militant operations room in Nur Shams, a refugee camp near Tulkarem. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the operation had been staged to “thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” claiming that Iran was working to establish an “eastern front” against Israel. “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps are required,” he wrote on social media. “This is a war for all terms and purposes and we must win it.” The operation comes as Israel steps up its military operations in the West Bank, where clashes have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. The IDF’s international spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said in a briefing that Israel had identified “a systematic strategy in Iran” of smuggling weapons and explosives into the West Bank. “Specifically, about Jenin and Tulkarm, we’ve seen over 150 shooting and explosive attacks originated from these areas alone over the past year,” Shoshani said on Wednesday. The Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry condemned the “violation and crimes” by Israel, “especially the ongoing war of genocide in the Gaza Strip and the targeting of the northern West Bank.” Palestinian deaths were reported in the towns of Tubas and Jenin, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). Later, the Ministry of Health said a Palestinian had been killed by gunfire in the town of Kafr Dan in Jenin district. The death toll rose to at least 11, according the latest statement from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. At least two of those killed in Jenin were as a result of Israeli military fire and three others were killed in a drone strike on a vehicle on the outskirts of Jenin, according to the PRCS. It added that one person was critically injured in the strike. On Wednesday, the United Nations chief called on Israel to immediately cease its military operation in the West Bank. The Israeli action was “fueling an already explosive situation in the occupied West Bank and further undermining the Palestinian Authority,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, according to a statement by his spokesperson. “Only an end to the occupation and a return to a meaningful political process that will establish a two-state solution will bring a end to the violence,” Guterres posted on X. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on X that Israel’s operation “must not constitute the premises of a war extension from Gaza, including full-scale destruction.” The Israeli foreign minister’s comparison of the operation with Gaza, particularly regarding the evacuation of Palestinians, “threatens to fuel further instability,” he said.

Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images Medical facilities besieged The Palestinian Ministry of Health warned that the Israeli military’s operation has impacted hospitals with reports that Israeli forces have besieged several medical facilities in Jenin and obstructed the movement of ambulances. In a statement, the ministry said Israeli forces blocked roads to Ibn Sina hospital with mounds of dirt, surrounded the government hospital in Jenin, and besieged the Red Crescent Society and the Patient’s Friends Society. “Dozens of patients are currently being treated in government, private, and charitable hospitals in Jenin,” the ministry said, adding that the lives of patients and medical staff are under threat.

IDF spokesperson Shoshani said troops have “no plan to seize or capture” the hospital in Jenin, but have stationed troops to prevent “terrorists” from seeking shelter and operating from there. “We’re trying to prevent the hospitals from becoming a war zone,” he said. Director of Jenin Government Hospital, Wissam Bakr, told CNN earlier on Wednesday that “three Israeli military vehicles (were) at the entrance of the hospital” and that the Governor of Jenin had been informed of Israeli troops intention to “to storm the Jenin Government hospital.” ‘General mobilization’ The Islamic Jihad militant group condemned the Israeli military’s “comprehensive aggression” on areas of the occupied West Bank, referring to it as an “open and undeclared war.” In a separate statement, the group’s military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, said it targeted and shot down an Israeli drone near Jenin. The group said its fighters are targeting Israeli forces with “heavy volleys of direct bullets.” CNN has not been able to verify the claim by Al-Quds Brigade. CCTV footage obtained from social media show Israeli military vehicles traveling along a road in Jenin on Wednesday. Social Media/Reuters Meanwhile, Hamas called for a “general mobilization… against the occupation and its settlers everywhere on our occupied land.” The group said the Israeli operation was “extensive” and accused the Israeli military of “deliberate destruction of infrastructure using large military forces accompanied by aerial bombardment from drones and warplanes.” Israel has occupied the West Bank since seizing the territory from Jordan in 1967. In the decades since, it has expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank, considered illegal under international law, despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s. The Palestinian health ministry reported on Tuesday that 652 Palestinians, including 150 children, have been killed in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October 7, with over 5,400 others injured. Israel condemns ‘terror’ attack by settlers As well as raids by the Israeli military, armed Jewish settlers have also launched frequent attacks on Palestinian towns. On August 15, more than 70 armed settlers attacked the village of Jit , firing live bullets at residents and setting several homes, cars, and other property on fire, according to the head of the village council, Nasser Sedda. One resident told CNN he had seen some 30 settlers – armed and dressed in black – jumping over the fence to his house, breaking windows and throwing Molotov cocktails inside. Top Israeli officials, including from the IDF, have condemned the attack on Jit. One Palestinian was killed by gunfire and another injured in the attack, according to the IDF – which says it is investigating the death with the Israel Securities Authority. “This is a very serious terror incident in which Israelis set out to deliberately harm the residents of the town of Jit, and we failed by not succeeding to arrive earlier to protect them,” the IDF Central Command Commanding Officer MG Avi Blut said in a statement Wednesday. Three adults have been detained under an administrative order and additional arrests are planned, the statement added. Two rapid response team members have also been dismissed and their weapons have been confiscated because they were at the scene “without authorization, dressed in uniform, and acted contrary to the authority defined for the members of the rapid response team,” the statement said. The Israeli army said the investigation into the incident “is still ongoing, and it will not be closed until we bring the perpetrators to justice.” In a landmark advisory opinion in July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN’s top court, said the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and that it should end its “unlawful presence” there “as rapidly as possible.” This story has been updated with additional information.

The US alleges the group also guarded the outposts of Israeli individuals previously sanctioned by the US. The US also sanctioned an Israeli individual, Yitzhak Levi Filant, who allegedly “led a group of armed settlers to set up roadblocks and conduct patrols to pursue and attack Palestinians in their lands and forcefully expel them from their lands” in February. “The United States will continue to take action to promote accountability for those who commit and support extremist violence affecting the West Bank,” Miller said. In the announcement, Miller again called on Israel’s government to “hold accountable” those responsible for settler violence against civilians in the West Bank. These sanctions are the latest in a wave from the US targeting Israel settler violence against Palestinians that has increased in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack against Israel that triggered the outbreak of the war in Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry reported on Tuesday that 652 Palestinians, including 150 children, have been killed in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October 7, with over 5,400 others injured. Most recently, the Biden administration sanctioned an Israeli violent extremist organization, Lehava, three Israeli individuals and four “outposts” connected to violence against Palestinians in the West Bank in July. President Joe Biden issued an executive order in February targeting violent West Bank settlers accused of directly perpetrating violence or intimidation. The administration alleged the targeted individuals of initiating and leading a riot, setting buildings, fields and vehicles on fire and assaulting civilians and damaging property. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the time called the sanctions unnecessary. “Israel acts against all lawbreakers everywhere, so there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard,” the prime minister’s office said at the time, adding that “the absolute majority” of Israeli settlers in the West Bank “are law-abiding citizens.” Prior to the order, in December, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new policy restricting extremist Israeli settlers responsible for violence in the West Bank from obtaining visas to come to the US. “We will continue to seek accountability for all acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank, regardless of the perpetrator or the victim,” Blinken said at the time. The new round of sanctions comes as Israel has killed at least 10 Palestinians in what the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) called an expansive counterterrorism operation in the West Bank involving raids and airstrikes. The Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry condemned the “violation and crimes” by Israel, “especially the ongoing war of genocide in the Gaza Strip and the targeting of the northern West Bank.” Hamas has called for a return to suicide bombings against Israeli military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli settlements in the West Bank , which have expanded for decades, are considered illegal under international law."

The US assesses that Hezbollah, the most powerful, capable and independent of Iran’s proxies across the region, does not want a full-scale war with Israel now, according to current and former US officials, even as it has engaged in a long-running series of relatively contained fire across the border. Hezbollah felt it had to respond to the Israeli assassination of one of its most senior commanders, Fu’ad Shukr, last month. But analysts say the targets selected by Hezbollah were military targets, hinting at a clear effort by the group to signal that its response was proportionate and to contain the risk of escalation. That’s not to say tensions in the Middle East are not high. Officials believe that Iran may still respond to the Israeli killing of a top Hamas official in Tehran — and that there may be further attacks from other Iranian-backed groups. A Hezbollah UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is intercepted by Israeli air forces over northern Israel following what Israel called preemptive strikes against the militant group. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images ANALYSIS Israel and Hezbollah step back from the brink of wider war — for now And uncertainty still hangs over the region as the conflict in Gaza grinds on, with a mounting Palestinian death toll and the two men responsible for reaching a resolution — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — still very far apart. But by Tuesday, Hezbollah had announced that its retaliation was “over.” Talks over a possible ceasefire in Gaza are limping along, moving from Cairo to Doha, Qatar, and Hezbollah and Israel’s exchanges have returned to typical tit-for-tat strikes across the border. Concerns were high last week that a major flare-up could trigger a wider war. On Saturday night, Israel acted on intelligence to preemptively strike more than 40 Hezbollah launch sites that it said were poised to be used in a major attack. Hezbollah quickly responded, firing what it said were both attack drones and more than 300 rockets at Israel. US officials said the speed of the Hezbollah response showed that it was prepared to launch a large-scale attack, and CNN has previously reported the group had already selected targets. One US military official said the original scope of the attack was expected to be roughly equivalent to what Hezbollah ultimately fired — over 300 projectiles. The Israeli military said the attack did “very little damage.” But almost immediately, Hezbollah was using public language that appeared aimed at cooling tensions. Officials and analysts say Hezbollah is well aware that a full-scale war with Israel would be incredibly destructive and offer little opportunity for strategic victory. The last time the two sides went to war, in 2006, hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes, more than 1,000 Lebanese people were killed, and civilian infrastructure and the Lebanese economy were damaged — all without a clear “victory” or resolution. Now, analysts say, Hezbollah likely knows that it lacks the domestic political support it would need to engage in all-out war with Israel — at a time when Lebanon’s economy and political system are already in shambles. “There’s long memories of 2006 and how the population blamed Hezbollah and [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah personally for what came — and that was a time when the Lebanese economy and political system was functioning,” said Jonathan Panikoff, a former US senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region. “I think eventually there will be a major war,” he added. “But I’m skeptical it’s going to happen [now], from an intention perspective.” Watching Iran closely Although Washington officials have speculated that Iran and Hezbollah could coordinate their responses to Israel for the assassination of the Hamas leader and the Hezbollah commander, some analysts say the dynamics are distinct. Hezbollah, officials said, has a far more direct stake in responding to Israel — and indeed, for weeks, officials have told CNN that they were more concerned about Hezbollah’s reaction than Iran’s. In April, Iran launched a massive salvo of missiles and drones at Israel in response to the Israeli killing of a senior Iranian commander in what Iran considered a diplomatic compound. But the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was different. The Iranian regime was “embarrassed,” said one source familiar with US intelligence, because the killing showed massive gaps in Iranian security — but ultimately, this person and others said, Haniyeh was not Iranian. Although Iran may be coming under pressure from some of its proxies to take a more aggressive stance against Israel, US officials believe that it is still deciding how and whether to respond — and that it is deeply reluctant to risk a possible regional war by engaging in direct conflict with Israel. “The issue is about embarrassment and restoring deterrence, but less about actual retribution,” Panikoff said. “There’s more variables that might restrain Iran because of who Israel actually killed.” Still, the US has not discounted the possibility that Iran may yet launch an attack on Israel. “We have to assume that Iran remains postured and prepared, should that be a decision that they make, which is why we continue to maintain a very robust force posture in the region,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday when asked whether there was an updated assessment on the likelihood that Tehran would strike Israel directly. Gaza ceasefire talks The worst may have been avoided for now, but US officials remain deeply concerned that the possibility of a broader regional war is only growing without a resolution to the conflict in Gaza. Officials have said publicly and privately that the strikes over the weekend had little impact on the ceasefire talks ongoing in Cairo.

Kirby noted that all sides, including Hamas, are represented in the talks and that the discussions have been able to move on with more specificity as they work to hammer out a deal. “I think it’s safe to say that the issues they’re going to be talking about are of a much more detailed, specific nature than we’ve typically been able to talk about,” he said. “For instance, one issue that will be for the working groups to flesh out is the exchange of hostages and prisoners that Israel’s holding.” Still, Israel has made it clear that following an initial six-week pause in the fighting, a break may be just that — a break — and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire."

Talks had made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the talks in Cairo, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement including the names of prisoners that would be exchanged as part of the pact. While such progress does not guarantee a final agreement anytime soon, negotiators in the Egyptian capital are now discussing the “nuts and bolts” of a deal, the official said. Kirby on Monday noted that all sides, including Hamas, are represented in the talks and that the discussions have been able to move on with more specificity as they work to hammer out a deal. Bassem Naim, a Hamas political bureau member, said Hamas was not participating in negotiations on Monday. Speaking to Al Arabi TV, he reiterated Hamas’s position that it is “ready to negotiate what was agreed upon” in a July 2 proposal but will “not accept the conditions that [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu added.” A Palestinian child in Gaza stands in the street with a water can and a toy horse, surrounded by rubble. Palm Media/MAP Related article Children are drinking from puddles and wading through sewage pools, as Israel pummels water systems in Gaza Negotiators have worked for months to bridge demands by Netanyahu and Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza. The remaining sticking points, while significant, are seen as potentially surmountable, the official said. One issue is the Israeli military’s presence on Gaza’s side of the border with Egypt, an area known as the Philadelphi corridor. Hamas opposes Israel’s desire to continue to station troops there in the early phase of a ceasefire deal. The US official said the current proposal calls for an Israeli military withdrawal from “densely populated areas” in Gaza, and that the current debate is focused on what parts of the Philadelphi corridor qualify as densely-populated versus unpopulated, where the IDF will maintain a presence in the first phase of an agreement. However, the Hamas negotiating delegation left Cairo on Sunday publicly reiterating the group’s demand that any agreement must include “a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the freedom of return of residents to their areas, relief and reconstruction, and a serious exchange deal.” The US official said despite public comments by Hamas, “negotiators believe Hamas may be more flexible on an Israeli presence during the first phase of an agreement.” Displaced Palestinians walk on a street covered with stagnant wastewater in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, on July 19. A ceasefire would allow a moment of relief for Gazans, after nearly a year of Israeli attacks. Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images The proposed agreement involves a “huge surge of humanitarian aid”, as well as a commitment to remove rubble and begin reconstruction, which are intended to bring “massive relief for Gazans,” said the US official. US negotiators expect Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to receive a copy of the latest proposal as soon as the coming days, though the timing is not clear given the difficulty of communications with him. A second US official said talks in Cairo were “constructive and were conducted in a spirit on all sides to reach a final and implementable agreement,” and that lower-level working group talks would continue in the coming days to “further address remaining issues and details.” On Thursday, the US and Egypt met with Israel to try to narrow remaining gaps and clarify issues in the text of bridging proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. The US and Egypt met bilaterally on Friday to discuss and prepare for the high-level talks this past weekend. On Saturday, Qatar and Egypt met with senior representatives of Hamas and went through each paragraph of the proposal in detail to identify any remaining issues or questions to clarify, the source said. Backdrop of regional unease The fact that the talks in Cairo went ahead Sunday despite the massive exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the weekend provided some sense of relief. Some US and Israeli officials believe that Hezbollah’s strike, which was largely neutralized by Israeli forces, removes leverage which Hamas had hoped would apply pressure on Israel for further concessions. Pressure is mounting to seal a deal against the backdrop of severe starvation , dire water shortages , mass displacement and disease in Gaza, caused by Israel’s war on Hamas in the strip. Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed at least 40,435 Palestinians and injured another 93,534 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. Israel’s military on Sunday ordered more evacuations in an area in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza where thousands of Gazans are currently sheltering. A senior UN official says no aid deliveries are happening in Gaza on Monday due to security risks after Israel ordered new evacuations for Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. But the official says the UN is not leaving Gaza “because the people need us there,” and that it wants to find a new location to operate in. Amid renewed Israeli evacuation orders, the IDF-designated “humanitarian zone” in the Strip has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities. There are 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli government’s press office.

A deadly rocket strike from Lebanon last month on the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights was followed by an Israeli retaliatory strike that killed Hezbollah’s top commander, Fu’ad Shukr, in southern Beirut. The powerful Iran-backed group vowed to respond. The threat triggered a slew of flight cancelations on both sides of the border, a chorus of governments imploring their citizens to leave Lebanon and Israel, and a breathless diplomatic effort to avert an escalation that Western governments feared would spark a regional conflict. On Sunday morning, Hezbollah said it had delivered its anticipated response by launching hundreds of drones and Katyusha rockets, Soviet-era short-range projectiles.

Hezbollah dismissed this. “What happened was aggression, not preemptive action,” Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech on Sunday night, referring to the Israeli strikes that began around half an hour before Hezbollah’s attack. Three Lebanese fighters were killed in those Israeli attacks, Hezbollah said. The cross-border fire on Sunday morning marked a significant escalation after nearly 11 months of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. But it appears to have dampened fears of a wider war, for now. In Israel, authorities soon lifted security restrictions in the country’s northern-most territory, known as the upper Galilee. In Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had concluded attacks on Israel for the day. Nasrallah declared the group’s retaliation for Shukr’s killing “meticulously” completed. With both sides declaring victory, the region appears to once again have walked back from the brink of all-out war. But while Hezbollah’s promised response appears to be largely out of the way, Israel must continue to wait for another threat to transpire: Iran’s vowed “revenge” for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which it blamed on Israel. The low-intensity conflict at the Lebanon-Israel border is set to resume. Netanyahu said on Sunday that “what happened today is not the end.” Nasrallah meanwhile struck a similar tone, reinforcing a widely held view that the fighting on the border is a war of attrition, where each side aims to wear down the other. A region on a knife’s edge After the attacks in Beirut and Tehran at the end of last month, Western and Israeli intelligence officials, diplomats and analysts scrambled to figure out what the retaliations promised by Iran and its most powerful non-state partner might look like. It sparked shuttle diplomacy with the United States, the United Kingdom and France urging Hezbollah and Iran to exercise restraint. This appeared to expedite another round of talks over a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, in a bid to ward off another escalation by the Iran-led axis, which has repeatedly conditioned stopping its attacks on Israel and its allies on an end to the Israeli offensive in Gaza. The talks to end the war continue to move at a glacial pace, despite intense diplomatic efforts by mediators including the US, Egypt and Qatar. High-level talks in Cairo ended on Sunday, giving way to the resumption of lower-level technical negotiations. But even as the US expresses optimism, with one official describing the weekend’s talks as “constructive,” there are no signs of progress on the major sticking points. Video Ad Feedback Hezbollah leader: We will ‘wait and see’ if there will be more strikes 02:26 - Source: CNN This raises the stakes for a potential showdown between Iran and Israel. But Tehran may be inclined to pay lip service to the talks. While it has vowed to respond to Israel, the Islamic Republic has repeatedly said that it wants to avoid action that could adversely impact the negotiations. And the latest escalation has shown that neither Iran nor its allied non-state fighting groups in the region can stomach the prospect of a wider war. Hezbollah had repeatedly vowed to retaliate to any Israeli strike in Beirut with an attack on major urban centers in Israel. Yet, whether by design or due to Israel’s claimed pre-emptive strikes, it fell short of that threat. Most of the areas it targeted on Sunday were within the border area that has been the site of the hostilities since October and the short-range Soviet-era rockets it used have been a mainstay of Hezbollah’s attacks on Israeli forces for decades. The risk of an all-out conflict appears to be significantly lower in the aftermath of Sunday’s crossfire. Yet Iran’s open-ended threat will continue to contribute to the war of nerves that has defined much of the low-grade conflict between the Tehran-led axis and Israel. The region will remain on a knife’s edge for as long as the war in Gaza goes on, at the mercy of the next miscalculation, no matter how low the warring parties’ appetite for conflict might be.

The overnight strikes are some of the most serious yet between Israel and Hezbollah, who have been exchanging fire for months. The hostilities have raised the specter of a regional conflagration, prompting intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 100 of its fighter jets “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels” across dozens of launch sites from Lebanon on Sunday. It followed these up with further attacks later in the day. Israel said it carried out the strikes in self-defense after identifying that Hezbollah was “preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.” Hezbollah called Israel’s description of its strike as preemptive “baseless.” “We removed a wider threat, probably also a future threat in some areas,” IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Sunday.

Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Related article The Middle East may have backed off from the brink of a regional war – for now Soon after the Israeli raids, the IDF said approximately 200 rockets had been launched from Lebanon towards Israel early Sunday, with no reports of injuries so far. Hezbollah said the “first phase” of its strikes against Israel “ended with complete success,” claiming that it launched 320 rockets and a barrage of drones toward Israel. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech later on Sunday that the group’s attack on Israel was “meticulously” completed but further strikes could be carried out. Hezbollah said it carried out strikes towards Israel in response to the killing of top military commander Fu’ad Shukr last month in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military intercepted “all of the drones that Hezbollah launched to a strategic target in the center of the country,” without clarifying what the target was. Netanyahu added that “what happened today is not the end,” and that Nasrallah in Beirut and Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in Tehran “should know that this was another step on our way to change the situation in the north and safely return our residents to their homes.” One Israeli soldier, 21-year-old David Moshe Ben Shitrit of the Israeli Navy, was killed in the fighting. He and two others were injured “either directly from an Iron Dome interceptor or from falling shrapnel from the interceptor that accidentally hit a Dvora-class fast patrol boat after intercepting a UAV,” an army official told CNN. Two people were killed in Israeli strikes on the village of At Tiri in Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon, Lebanese health officals said, and a third was killed when a car was hit in the town of Khiyam. The Hezbollah-allied Shia group Amal movement also said one of its fighters, was killed in Khiyam, but it is unclear if they are the same person.

Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images For the Lebanese group, Shukr’s assassination was a change in the rules of engagement, Danny Citrinowicz, research fellow in the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said. “They had to retaliate,” Citrinowicz told CNN, adding that the group may have been trying to “draw a line in the sand” to avoid further attacks. “The question was not if but when,” he said, adding that it is yet to be seen whether the group will be content with its attack or whether more projectiles will follow in the coming days. Ceasefire talks resume despite strikes The attacks took place just hours before mediation talks resumed in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which aim to strike a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli official told CNN on Sunday afternoon that Israeli negotiators arrived in Cairo for ceasefire and hostage release negotiations. CNN Related card Hezbollah: What weapons does it have?

The Iranian government is yet to react to the cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah, something Citrinowicz said suggested Iran was willing to distance itself from Hezbollah’s attack amid the negotiations in Cairo. Following the strikes, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant declared a “‘special situation on the home front’ across the country,” which enables the Israeli military to issue instructions to citizens, “including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant.” ﻿ US President Joe Biden is closely monitoring events in Israel and Lebanon, the White House said Saturday night.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/middleeast/israel-ready-iran-hezbollah-attack-intl-latam/index.html,Israel says it is prepared for any retaliatory attack from Iran or Hezbollah,The news comes amid claims in the Israeli media that there are situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon.,"Aug 25, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Dana Karni,Middle East,"CNN — Israel said Saturday its military was prepared for any possible retaliatory attacks by Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah or Iran for the killings of their senior leaders. The news comes amid claims in the Israeli media that there are situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon. Both Hezbollah and Iran have been threatening to retaliate against Israel since a string of figures in Iran-backed militant groups were killed over a span of weeks. Those killings included the death of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander Fu’ad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut at the end of July and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Asked about the threats of retaliation, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters Saturday that the military was prepared for any possible attack by either Hezbollah or Iran. “We take our enemies’ threats seriously and we’ve been ready for a long period. We’re highly prepared both in the offense and defense, but above all, any threat toward the citizens of Israel we identify, we eliminate, and that’s how we’ll continue. Any development that will be, we’ll update the public immediately,” Hagari said. Hagari was then pressed by a reporter from Israel’s state-run Kan 11 television channel, who said there were situational assessments that Hezbollah could attack soon. The IDF spokesperson did not say whether he was familiar with those assessments, nor did he give any indication of when an attack might be expected. CNN Related card Hezbollah: What weapons does it have? A visual guide “We’ve been, like I said, we’ve been ready, first of all, both in offense and defense, for a long time. We operate to eliminate threats and will continue to do so. With any change or development, we will immediately update the public. Our mission is to defend the citizens of Israel,” Hagari said. A major attack against Israel could risk disrupting the ceasefire talks that US officials have said were at an advanced stage prior to the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, which Iran has blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli government press office. This week, the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from tunnels in Gaza in an Israeli military operation in the city of Khan Younis. Israel’s war in Gaza was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,200 people have died in Gaza during the war, according to Palestinian authorities."

As senior negotiators prepare to meet this weekend in Cairo, there are still several sticking points in the talks over the potential three-phase agreement. But Israel has made it clear that following the initial six-week phase, a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire. “I am ready to do a partial deal, it is no secret, that will bring back some of the people,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel’s Channel 14 in late June. “But we are committed to continue the war after the pause in order to achieve the goal of destroying Hamas. I will not give up on this.” There’s no indication that Israel’s position has changed and the fact this stance doesn’t violate the agreement being discussed represents a breakthrough for Israel in the negotiations. It essentially allows Israel – and Hamas – to abandon discussions after the six-week first phase and resume the war. That breakthrough was a concession by the Palestinian militant group, which has been pushing for the temporary pause to seamlessly transition to a permanent ceasefire and the war to end. The sister-in-law of a deceased Israeli hostage who met with Netanyahu this week, Riki Baruch, told CNN her takeaway from the meeting was “the prime minister’s promise to defeat Hamas, and to continue fighting until the last of the hostages returns.” The sister-in-law of a deceased Israeli hostage who met with Netanyahu this week, Riki Baruch, told CNN her takeaway from the meeting was “the Prime Minister’s promise to defeat Hamas, and to continue fighting until the last of the hostages returns.” Knowing that the long-sought-after agreement wouldn’t guarantee an end to the war, US officials have lowered their expectations and focused on getting first to a period of calm, even if it’s technically just temporary, hoping that enough pressure would build on multiple fronts during the pause to prevent the reignition of violence. “What we’re focused on right now is getting a ceasefire deal in place, getting those hostages home, getting six weeks of calm,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last week. “That’s really what our goal is right now.” A ceasefire deal that leads to a pause in fighting would be welcomed by countless people on both sides. Palestinians in Gaza, almost all of whom have been displaced, would get a respite after almost a year of continuous Israeli bombing, along with desperately needed aid. Israeli families would get hostages or their remains home after 10 painful months of waiting. Huge challenges remain if initial deal is reached But as complicated as the hurdles are to reaching this first stage of an agreement, even tougher challenges loom before Israel will agree to end the war. The way the agreement is laid out, that permanent end to the fighting is set to begin in the second phase, at which point Hamas would release all remaining hostages and all Israeli troops would withdraw from Gaza. In the third phase, reconstruction in the enclave would begin and the final remains of hostages would be returned. In announcing the framework on May 31 – which both Hamas and Israel agreed to — President Joe Biden admitted there would be considerable issues left to negotiate after the temporary pause started. Hamas had hoped the only remaining discussion would be about how many Palestinian prisoners would be released for the Israeli hostages, but Israel pushed for that topic – known as the “keys” — to just be one of the topics the sides could discuss during the transition from the first phase to secure the second. As long as those discussions continue, Biden had said, the ceasefire from the first phase would also continue, past the six-week mark. As hard as the mediators – the US, Egypt and Qatar – could try to keep those conversations on track to prevent a return to fighting, they could simply fall apart and both sides could once again take up arms. Hours after Biden laid out the May 31 framework, Netanyahu’s office posted on X that “Israel’s conditions for ending the war have not changed.” “The destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel,” he said. Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is believed to still be alive despite fierce Israeli efforts to hunt him down. Thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters also remain on the battlefield. Only around 30 of the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages would be expected to be released by Hamas in the first part of a truce and it’s still unclear how many of those would be alive, sources familiar the talks say. Negotiators are still discussing how many and which Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange, how many vetoes Israel would have over the names Hamas would put forward of those serving longer sentences for more violent crimes, and where they would be released to. New Philadelphi Corridor proposal Much attention recently has been focused on the question of Israeli troop presence along the Egypt-Gaza border, known as the Philadelphi corridor. In the agreement being discussed, IDF forces are supposed to withdraw from densely populated areas, but Israel has argued that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza. On Wednesday Netanyahu’s office denied an Israeli report that he had agreed to withdraw from the corridor. “Achievement of all of [Israel’s] objectives for the war,” a statement said, “requires securing the southern border.” Holding onto Philadelphi during the six-week first phase, even if were in a more limited way with fewer forces, would give Israel flexibility and more options militarily for later scenarios. CNN reported on Friday that Israel has come up with a new proposal on the corridor, which Egypt is set to deliver to Hamas. Israel submitted the revised plan on Thursday diplomat and an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. The new Israeli proposal, which includes a map of where Israeli troops would be deployed, reduces the number of troops and military posts along the strategic corridor bordering Egypt from Israel’s previous position, the Israeli source said. Egyptian negotiators had rejected the previous Israeli map days earlier and declined to transfer it to Hamas, calling it a non-starter.

Egyptian negotiators had rejected the previous Israeli map days earlier and declined to transfer it to Hamas, calling it a non-starter. Hamas’ response to the new proposal will be critical to determining whether it sends negotiators to an expected negotiating summit in Cairo on Sunday. If they attend, the two sides could hold true negotiations – with each side’s delegation occupying a room, and Egyptian and Qatari mediators going back-and-forth between the two. The new proposal was the product of an hours-long meeting between Netanyahu and his negotiating team on Thursday at which Netanyahu agreed to reduce troop levels. That meeting came a day after Netanyahu spoke with President Joe Biden, who pushed Netanyahu to show more flexibility on the Philadelphi corridor. Deep divisions among Israeli leadership There are deep divisions and differences of opinion among the Israeli security officials and the Netanyahu government. Far-right members of his cabinet have blasted any ceasefire agreement while Israeli reports cite security officials who accuse Netanyahu of sabotaging the negotiations. “The (Israeli) military would like a ceasefire now, a ceasefire that achieves objectives of getting hostages out,” a senior American official said. “All issues outstanding are manageable. Not perfect but manageable.” The lead negotiator for the Biden administration, CIA Director Bill Burns, has landed in Cairo for the latest round of talks on Friday. To try to finalize an agreement, the US, along with co-mediators Qatar and Egypt, put forward a proposal to bridge the final disagreements. Earlier this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was visiting Israel, said Netanyahu had agreed to the proposal while Hamas had not yet. Hamas has accused Israel in recent days of changing the terms, while reports have said that Netanyahu has changed and reneged on a number of positions. A senior Biden administration official recently called Israel’s changes “ clarifications,” while US officials have publicly and persistently maintained that a deal is close and that mere “implementation” issues remain to be discussed. But many involved are not as optimistic. One source familiar with all the discussions since the last temporary truce fell apart almost nine months ago called the situation “near hopeless,” adding that that this week’s negotiations following last week’s round in Doha have failed to produce positive developments. One major unknown is what Hamas leader Sinwar wants: a break for his fighters and the Palestinians suffering immensely or a larger regional conflict driven by Iran and Hezbollah that would further engulf Israel. Some observers believe Sinwar is waiting to see how Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran retaliate against Israel for recent assassinations of a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut and Hamas’ political leader in Tehran. Whatever the outcome of the weekend’s talks, all signs suggest that the most Israel is willing to consider right now is 42 days of quiet. After that, all bets are off. “It’s easy to be pessimistic because it’s gone on a long time,” the senior American official conceded. “They could have closed this many times but didn’t.” CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report."

Egyptian negotiators had rejected the previous Israeli map days earlier and declined to transfer it to Hamas, calling it a non-starter. The Philadelphi corridor is a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt- that the IDF currently controls. The deployment of Israeli troops along the Philadelphi corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas. Israel has demanded maintaining control of the border zone, whereas Hamas has said Israeli troops must withdraw from the area. Hamas’ response to the new proposal will be critical to determining whether it sends negotiators to an expected negotiating summit in Cairo on Sunday.

Moments later, an orange blaze tears through the critical facility in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, as ribbons of grey smoke erupt into the sky. The blast was captured in a now deleted video , which was reportedly shared by an Israeli soldier on Instagram and geolocated by CNN. Satellite imagery shows that the reservoir was damaged between July 26 and July 27. Destroyed buildings are visible in the surrounding area. The reservoir could hold 3 million liters of water and was central to the treatment and distribution of water in the Rafah Governate, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), providing water for 150,000 people prior to October 7, when the war began. When asked about the incident captured on camera, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that its troops had been operating in the Tal al-Sultan area for several weeks to “dismantle terrorist infrastructures and eliminate terrorists, whilst taking feasible measures in order to mitigate damage to civilian structures.” It added that it examines reports of videos posted to social media and handles them with disciplinary measures. The IDF said the incident was under review by the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, “an independent investigative mechanism outside the chain of command entrusted with investigating exceptional events in warfare.” Maxar Technologies Maxar Technologies Satellite images show Canada Water reservoir in Rafah, southern Gaza, on July 18 (left) and July 30 (right). ©2024 Maxar Technologies There have been many water facilities damaged or destroyed by Israel’s 10-month-long assault in Gaza, according to the UN and various other international bodies, compounding the civilian population’s suffering, risking the spread of disease and leading human rights experts to accuse Israel of using water supply as a weapon . The destruction of the Canada Water reservoir “is certainly a breach of international humanitarian law (IHL),” Mark Zeitoun, director general of the Geneva Water Hub, a Swiss institute specializing in hydro-diplomacy, told CNN. “IHL is meant to protect against indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population or the objects they depend upon (for) survival,” he said. Even before the controlled explosion in late July, the Israeli siege drained fuel and electricity supplies needed to power the Canada Water reservoir and other water systems in the city, according to Rafah’s mayor, Ahmed Al-Sofi, causing severe shortages. “Rafah was already suffering from water shortages,” Al-Sofi told CNN in July. “The city of Rafah is a city struck by destruction, hunger and thirst.” The amount of water available in Gaza works out at 4.74 liters of water (1 gallon) per person per day, Oxfam reported in July, adding that this is “just under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies and less than a single toilet flush.” The international nonprofit has accused Israel of using water as a “weapon of war,” saying Palestinians in Gaza have “almost no water to drink, let alone to bathe, cook, or clean.” Extreme summer heat in Gaza is making a desperate shortage of water even worse for Palestinians already stalked by famine and struggling with repeated displacement. This June was the hottest on record in Israel, according to the Israel Meteorological Service. Temperatures in Negba, a few miles north of Gaza, reached 39.4 C (103F) in the middle of the month, according to CNN meteorologists. Israel’s war in Gaza has reduced supplies of fuel, chlorine and spare parts, stifling water production, purification and sewage pumping, according to the UN. Around 70% of all water and sanitation facilities in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, the WASH Cluster, a United Nations-led group that coordinates humanitarian efforts for water, sanitation and hygiene, said on July 24, citing satellite analysis from the UN Satellite Centre. Palestinian children cool off and fill up water jugs in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, amid a heatwave on June 9, a day after a deadly operation by Israeli forces to rescue hostages. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, told CNN in a statement that Israel allows and facilitates the “unlimited entry” of water tanks and fuel supplies into Gaza. It added that there has been a “continual effort” since the start of the war to facilitate the repair and extension of water wells, desalination facilities and water mains. But several Palestinians told CNN they are forced to make hazardous journeys in search of water, risking exposure to Israeli attacks. Two people told CNN they had witnessed physical violence and even killing at public distribution points as people fight for scant resources. Those displaced to makeshift camps described scenes of sewage spilling into the streets and children drinking from puddles. More than 1.7 million cases of infectious diseases have been recorded in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there. Traces of the highly infectious polio virus – transmitted through faeces, and contaminated water or food – were found in a 10-month-old child in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah earlier this month. The child was later paralyzed due to the disease, the UN said on August 23. World Health Organization (WHO) testing discovered the virus in sewage samples in Gaza in July, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis. After the Gaza Ministry of Health declared a polio epidemic last month, the WHO warned that ongoing Israeli bombardment had stifled vaccination efforts in Gaza . They are now calling for a halt to the fighting to allow for an effective vaccination drive. Widower Alaa Riyad says he treks many miles every day under the glare of the sun to collect water for his family, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza. The 42-year-old told CNN that he became “father and mother” to his children after his wife and 18 other relatives were killed by Israeli bombardment several months ago. “We have found worms in the water more than once,” he told CNN. “What can we do?… There is no life for us.” Israeli attacks in the strip have killed more than 40,200 Palestinians and injured about 93,000 since the war started, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after the militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities. ‘Near complete destruction of all water infrastructure’ Gaza’s water crisis has been building for decades. In 2017, the UN’s children’s agency, UNICEF, said that 95% of water from Gaza’s sole aquifer was “unfit for human consumption,” due to over-extraction, seawater infiltration and sewage contamination. In 2021, about 90% of Gaza’s water came from groundwater wells drawing water from that aquifer, according to the Palestinian Water Authority. The remaining 10% came mostly from desalination plants and Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, via three pipelines. But since early summer, Gaza’s municipal wells and desalination plants (two out of three of which are functioning) have operated at an average of around 15% and 22% capacity, respectively, according to CNN analysis of WASH Cluster data. Wim Zwijnenburg, who investigates the environmental impact of conflicts for the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN the level of damage done to Gaza’s water systems is “the most severe we’ve seen so far in any conflict in the last 10 years, probably even longer.” “What we’re seeing so far… is the near-complete destruction of all water infrastructure, which includes water pumping stations, water wells, the whole piping system in Gaza,” Zwijnenburg said. “The few functioning pumps that are still operating, the quality of the water is so bad… (But) people have no choice but to drink it.” Within the first week of the war, Saaed Al-Madhoun, an emergency response manager for the humanitarian agency CARE International, was forced to flee an Israeli incursion with his family near their home in Gaza City, which was later flattened by bombardment. The aid worker is haunted by “constant fear and uncertainty,” as the threat of Israeli attacks loom over his wife and five children, aged between 1 and 13 years old. They are displaced in miserable conditions in Deir al-Balah, where the entire family survives on just 20 liters of water per day – less than the minimum of 3 liters per person needed for survival, according to UNICEF . “Most of the water we access is not potable… it often has a salty or metallic taste,” he said in testimony relayed to CNN by CARE International. “I have seen children drinking from puddles.” ‘Completely miserable’ conditions in tent camps Barbed wire and concrete slabs sink into huge pools of green, sewage-contaminated water in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Footage filmed by a journalist working for CNN shows residents tiptoeing through streams of muddy water pouring through the once-vibrant neighborhood. The Israeli offensive has displaced up to 1.9 million people – nearly the entire population – in Gaza, according to the UN . People in sprawling tent camps say they can barely access potable water or sanitation facilities in areas polluted by raw sewage and teeming with bugs . Women endure several menstrual cycles without washing, according to the UN . Others queue in the heat to use toilets at overwhelmed hospitals – or risk being chased by dogs to use washrooms in the middle of the night. The UN previously recorded one improvised shelter with only 25 toilets for 14,000 people inside and 59,000 outside. Palestinians told CNN they must prioritize scarce water supplies for consumption instead of bathing, washing clothes or cleaning dishes. Parents told CNN they struggle to find enough gas or fuel to boil and sterilize water, increasing the risk of illness. Some give their children food that requires minimal water for preparation – but offers poor nutritional value. Others describe water contaminated during transportation in unclean tanks. Children walk through pools of green, sewage-contaminated water in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. CNN Mohammed Hamouda, a health worker displaced in Deir al-Balah, told CNN he and his family, including his three young children, have suffered from diarrhea and abdominal cramps due to consumption of dirty water. “We get the water supposedly clean and drinkable,” he said. “But gastrointestinal diseases and intestinal diseases occur… We do not know that it is unclean until after we use it,” he said. “Obtaining clean water is difficult. Getting water for bathing is more difficult. Finding a toilet to relieve oneself is also very difficult.” Muslims cannot find enough water to make ablution before prayer, a necessity for those seeking moments of relief through faith . Children suffer from skin rashes, expectant mothers face stillbirth risk Asma struggles to distract her children from the stinging pain of blisters and itchiness of head lice. The Palestinian mother is staying with seven relatives in Deir al-Balah, where insects crawl between the folds of their tent. “In the tents we have… an unimaginable quantity of insects, pincher bugs and cockroaches,” she said, in an account relayed to CNN by CARE International. “We get tired trying to cool and fan ourselves.” Asma’s last name has been withheld by CARE International to protect her identity. “My children are sick, and we can’t even find medical treatment,” she added. “We have no shampoo, or detergent to wash our clothes… What are we supposed to do?” A Palestinian girl is diagnosed with a skin infection in Gaza, on July 26. Health workers say children are catching skin infections due to contaminated water and a lack of access to sanitation facilities. Dawoud Abo Alkas/Anadolu/Getty Images Chronic water shortages will compound “all the existing fragility” among the population, according to Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care doctor working with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, especially for the most vulnerable. The stress of war paired with water shortages increases the risk of stillbirth , pre-term delivery and blood clots for pregnant women in Gaza , Haj-Hassan said. Breastfeeding women are less likely to produce enough milk for newborns, potentially causing malnourishment. Those who can access sparse supplies of powdered infant formula may not find clean water to make up bottles, compounding the risk of illness, Haj-Hassan added. Sustained restrictions on aid Israel’s COGAT told CNN they have facilitated the entry of 48,670 tons of water aid into Gaza since the war began, adding that they have provided 14 forklift trucks to assist with aid collection at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Gaza and Israel, as well as broadening supply routes and increasing operating hours for aid collection. But relief workers say what’s coming in is not nearly enough to respond to soaring needs, blaming Israel for sustained aid restrictions, blocked access to parts of the north , destruction of roads and attacks on relief convoys . Humanitarian workers and government officials told CNN in March that Israeli officials were repeatedly rejecting much needed aid, including water purification tablets and filtration systems, at entry points to Gaza. COGAT described the testimony given to CNN at the time as “false accusations.” Sham Abu Tabaq, age five, saw her father and sister shot dead in front of her. CNN Related article She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter. Then soldiers brought her to an Israeli hospital Liz Allcock, head of protection at the UK-based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians, told CNN she saw “thousands and thousands” of bottles of water sitting at the Kerem Shalom border crossing on July 3. Several Palestinians told CNN that scarcity, the risks involved in transporting water, and fuel shortages had driven up the cost of water to unaffordable levels. Some say the absence of regulation means water supplied by aid agencies is sold on the black market for an inflated cost. In some areas, water has risen from $7 for 1,000 liters (about 264 gallons) to $45 to $50, Haj-Hassan said. Hamouda, the father-of-three displaced in Deir al-Balah, said the daily cost of water for him and his family has risen from one-third of a dollar in October to $2. Raed Radwan, a father displaced to a tent in Deir al-Balah told CNN that he was constantly worried about keeping his family cool and hydrated. His five-month-old daughter recently suffered heatstroke, and he had no cold water to give her. “For nine months, we have been enduring the ongoing water crisis… I hope there will be a solution to the water problem because I can no longer handle it. I am mentally and physically exhausted,” he said in July. CNN’s Gianluca Mezzofiore, Abeer Salman, Tareq El Helou, Ibrahim Dahman and Lauren Izso contributed reporting."

People were seen in video walking or on donkey carts as they left areas near the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah. Some were in private cars, loaded with their belongings, including mattresses and blankets, water and gas bottles. The streets appear littered with leaflets dropped by the IDF reiterating the order to evacuate. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have also ordered evacuations for parts of the southern city of Khan Younis, as well as the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. Planet Labs, PBC Planet Labs, PBC Satellite images obtained by CNN from Planet Labs show just how many Gazans fled the areas that are no longer marked as being in the humanitarian zone. Above, the humanitarian zone near Qizan an Najjar before and after August 16. Many residents now on the move have had to evacuate time and time again – leaving them in a constant state of displacement, uncertainty and fear that there is nowhere left to flee. Evacuees leaving Deir al-Balah on Wednesday described the overwhelming sense of fear, sorrow and uncertainty. “There is bombardment, shooting, and quadcopters since this morning in the east of Deir al-Balah, so we are forced to flee. People go to the unknown. They have no idea,” said one evacuee, Muhammad Awad. “There are no longer places to go. There was only Deir al-Balah, and now they are asking us to evacuate Deir al-Balah,” one elderly man told CNN. “I am afraid that tomorrow they will confine all of us on the seashore of Deir al-Balah, then exterminate all of us.” “After so many displacements, we no longer have the strength to evacuate yet another time,” he added.

One woman on a cart, Um Alaa, said it was the fourth time she has had to evacuate since October last year. “We don’t know where to go. We are going to look for a spot away from this dangerous place,” she said. “The whole of Gaza has become dangerous.” Um Ismail, a woman with small children, said people were defenseless. “Why are they fighting us?” she said. “We are not Hamas, we are simply people staying put in our homes. They displaced us not once, but 10 times. Why? What have we done?” Abu Muhammad Hajjaj, a resident of Gaza City who had previously been displaced, lamented the lack of resources. Without money for a car, or even a tent to live in, “we don’t know where to go,” he told CNN. “People are crying and complaining of everything: disease, hunger, poverty, lack of hygiene, lack of medicine. You search in all of Gaza for paracetamol for a headache and you can’t find it,” he said. Palestinians flee with their belongings in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, on August 21, 2024. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/AP Steadily shrinking Nearly 84% of the enclave has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war, according to the United Nations’ main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, UNWRA. All the while, the Israel-designated “humanitarian zone” has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis. “Areas that were (in) the humanitarian zone are now the frontline,” said Louise Wateridge, spokesperson for UNWRA. Gazans “are never more than a few blocks away from the frontline now,” she told the UN’s news service. The evacuation orders have complicated aid efforts, too. The UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA reported that parts of a major road, crucial for humanitarian missions going from south to north, were caught up in the evacuations for Deir al-Balah. It is now “nearly impossible” for aid workers to travel along the route, preventing the delivery of critically needed supplies, the UN reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden. Getty Images Related article Biden spoke with Netanyahu Wednesday at a critical moment in Gaza talks Among those fleeing are staff from the international non-profit Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders. “The continuous forced displacement of people is inhumane,” MSF project coordinator Jacob Granger said in a statement on Wednesday. “People have no belongings left, nowhere left to go. There is no room to put tents up. The overcrowding, severe lack of water, and minimal sanitation services are fueling the spread of diseases.” The UN estimated in July that up to 1.9 million people in the strip have been displaced, almost the entire population of 2.1 million Gazans. Last week, the enclave’s Health Ministry estimated that more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas. That figure does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but the ministry said most of the dead are women and children. Israel said last month that it had killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers. Ceasefire talks Throughout the evacuations, US and Israeli leaders have continued discussing a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal – with President Joe Biden speaking with his Israeli counterpart Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, the White House said. It comes at a critical moment after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this week that it may be the last opportunity for a deal. CIA Director Bill Burns and other senior negotiators are expected to return to Cairo for further high-level talks this weekend. A major sticking point is the future of the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border, which the IDF currently controls. On Tuesday, Blinken said Israel had agreed to military withdrawals from Gaza that are laid out in the recent proposal, despite reported comments from Netanyahu. Blinken was responding to Israeli media reports that Netanyahu conveyed to America’s top diplomat that Israel would not leave the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim corridor, which bisects Gaza, “regardless of the pressure to do so.” This story has been updated with additional information.

Transport Minister Miri Regev, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, has been appointed by the government to organize the memorial. CNN video Related video Hear from woman who’s husband is still held by Hamas “A year has passed since citizens were abandoned in the greatest disaster in Israel’s history. One-hundred-and-nine hostages have yet to return, and the living have not been brought back for rehabilitation, nor have the bodies of the murdered been returned for burial,” the forum added. The forum said it would instead join communities of the Gaza border area and southern Israel to mark October 7. Monthslong talks to release the hostages in exchange for a ceasefire in Gaza have repeatedly stalled as mediators the United States, Qatar and Egypt ramp up efforts to reach an agreement. Israel insists that it won’t end the war until Hamas is eliminated from Gaza and has demanded that it retain control over the Gaza-Egypt border and restrict the movement of armed men from the south of the strip to its north. Hamas has rejected those demands. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli government press office. This week, the bodies of six Israeli hostages were retrieved from tunnels in Gaza in an Israeli military operation in the city of Khan Younis. Israel’s war in Gaza was launched after Hamas-led militants attacked the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,200 people have died in Gaza during the war, according to Palestinian authorities. ‘Do what is right’ Hostage families have repeatedly accused Netanyahu of stalling negotiations and abandoning the captives to keep his governing coalition intact . Hardline ministers in his cabinet have threatened to collapse the government if he agrees to end the war. “Together, we’ll demand the restoration of security, the return of the hostages, the rehabilitation of communities, and an investigation into the failures that led to the terrible disaster of October 7,” the forum said.

According to Israeli public broadcaster Kan, a CNN affiliate, many of those kibbutzim that were attacked on October 7, including Be’eri, Re’im, Nirim, Kfar Aza, Nahal Oz, Nir Oz, Yad Mordechai and Nir Yitzhak, will boycott the event. Representatives of the towns of Ofakim and Sderot will participate, according to Kan. Leader of Israel’s National Unity party and former war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Wednesday said that it should be the affected communities – and not Regev – organizing the event. “The nature of this day must be determined by those who endured the inferno: the residents of the Western Negev settlements, the hostages and their families, the families of the fallen, and the wounded,” Gantz wrote on X. Addressing Regev, Gantz added: “It is not too late to reconsider and do what is right. Transfer the responsibility for managing the ceremony to the Minister of Culture, establish a joint steering committee with the leaders of the Western Negev communities and the bereaved families, and truly listen to them.”"

On Wednesday, Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported that Israel’s withdrawal from the 8.7-mile strip of land along the border between Gaza and Egypt would be an element of the proposal agreed to by Netanyahu. Blinken and other US officials have declined to detail the “bridging proposal” the US laid out last week, which is designed to bring Israel and Hamas closer to a ceasefire agreement. But Hamas insists that the IDF withdraw fully from Gaza and that citizens must be allowed to return home. Israeli officials counter that a solution must be found to better control the Egypt-Gaza border, which has long been used for smuggling. But the prime minister’s office quickly denied any intention to leave the area, which Israeli troops seized in May. “Israel will insist on the achievement of all of its objectives for the war, as they have been defined by the Security Cabinet, including that Gaza never again constitutes a security threat to Israel. This requires securing the southern border,” his office said in a statement on Wednesday, describing Kan’s reporting as “incorrect.” The statement also appeared to contradict comments by Blinken on Tuesday, when he said that Netanyahu had agreed to the bridging proposal and its proposed troop withdrawals. “The agreement is very clear on the schedule and the locations of IDF withdrawals from Gaza, and Israel has agreed to that,” said Blinken in remarks to reporters before departing Qatar. Blinken was speaking in Qatar at the end of a short trip to the region as the US makes what it hopes is a final push for all sides to agree to a ceasefire agreement that would halt the fighting in Gaza and free the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The top US diplomat said Monday in Israel that the onus would be on Hamas to also agree to the latest proposal to bridge the outstanding issues. A US senior administration official has previously criticized Netanyahu’s reported comments about not withdrawing as “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line.” CIA Director Bill Burns and other senior negotiators are expected to return to Cairo for further high-level talks this weekend. Meanwhile, the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group arrived in the Middle East on Wednesday, according to US Central Command, bolstering US forces as the region braces for a potential Iranian attack. The aircraft carrier was ordered to the Middle East in early August in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Iranian officials vowed to retaliate against Israel for the assassination. On August 11, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the carrier and its accompanying destroyers to accelerate their transit to the Middle East amid widespread concerns that Iran may be preparing for a large-scale, coordinated attack against Israel with its regional proxies. On Tuesday, Iran said that its response to Israel must be “carefully calibrated” to avoid derailing the ceasefire negotiations. But Iran’s mission to the UN made it clear that a response was still coming. “The timing, conditions, and manner of Iran’s response will be meticulously orchestrated to ensure that it occurs at a moment of maximum surprise,” said the Iranian mission in a statement to CNN. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group joins the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group. The USS Theodore Roosevelt is expected to remain in the region for several more days before it returns to the US, according to three US defense officials. The Pentagon previously announced that the USS Abraham Lincoln would replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The US also has the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, several destroyers and the USS Georgia, a guided missile submarine.

The Middle East has been on high alert since last month’s assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, which came the day after Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr was killed in an airstrike in Beirut. Israel took responsibility for the killing of Shukr, but has not confirmed or denied its role in Haniyeh’s death. Iran and its regional allies – Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza – blamed Israel for both killings and promised to retaliate, spurring weeks of high-wire diplomacy to prevent the breakout of a full-scale regional war. CNN video Related video How the failure of America’s Iran deal is now affecting Middle East But the comments from the IRGC spokesman, three weeks on from the twin killings, may indicate a cooling of Iran’s earlier, more bellicose rhetoric. Naeini said Iran’s response could differ from previous operations against Israel, saying that Tehran will not take “hasty action.” “For now, the Zionists must live in instability and Iran’s response may not be a repeat of past operations,” he said. “The response scenarios are not the same. Our commanders have the experience and the art of effectively punishing the enemy and will not take hasty action.” In April, Iran launched some 300 projectiles at Israel – its first-ever direct attack on the country – after blaming it for a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, which killed Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander. Naeini added that “the Zionist regime (Israel) has accepted the defeat, even American politicians have acknowledged this and have not yet achieved any of their goals,” referring to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has been fought for more than 10 months with the aim of defeating Hamas and returning the hostages it took from Israel on October 7. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Monday, August 19. Handout/Maayan Toaf/GPO Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ramped up after the twin killings of Shukr and Haniyeh, as Arab and Western officials sought to avoid an all-out war. Impact on Gaza ceasefire deal There have been some indications that Iran may abandon plans to attack Israel if a ceasefire deal is reached. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said Tuesday that its retaliation against Israel for Haniyeh’s assassination must be “carefully calibrated to avoid any possible adverse impact that could potentially influence a prospective ceasefire.” “The timing, conditions, and manner of Iran’s response will be meticulously orchestrated to ensure that it occurs at a moment of maximum surprise,” the mission said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. The statement came a day after the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said there is “no direct connection” between Iran’s support for reaching a ceasefire deal and its determination to avenge Haniyeh’s killing, according to state news agency ISNA. In an interview in the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday, Mohsen Rezaee, former commander-in-chief of the IRGC, told CNN that “Iranian actions will be very calculated ones,” adding that there has to be a ceasefire in Gaza “soon.” Iranians attend the funeral procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024.

Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters Related article Iran’s mixed signals leave some allies in the dark and set region on edge “The United States and Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If in the first weeks of the Gaza war the United States had stopped Israel and (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, the war would not extend. So the main element of the extension of the war are the US and Israel. The more this war extends the more the United States will be damaged,” he said. Regarding Iran’s response to Israel, Razaee said: “We have investigated the possible repercussions. And we will not let Netanyahu, who is sinking in a swamp, save him himself. The Iranian actions will be very calculated ones.” Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor for the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the IRGC’s statement on Tuesday is unlikely to signal Iran scrapping its plans to attack Israel but rather indicates a decision to delay it. “Iran finds itself between a rock and a hard place right now,” she said, adding that the recently elected government of Masoud Pezeshkian, considered a moderate in the country, would be keen not to look weak domestically by not responding to Israel. She added, however, that the government currently lacks the bandwidth to “invite an escalation spiral right now” as it aims to focus on domestic priorities and de-escalate on the foreign policy front. This approach could shift depending on the outcome of the Gaza ceasefire talks, which Iran is keen not to disrupt, she said. “That also means the negotiations are much higher stakes. So, if they do fail, there’s an even greater incentive for the Iranians to carry out an attack.” After talks resumed last week in Qatar’s capital Doha, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge gaps in ceasefire negotiations, and that “the next important step is for Hamas to say yes” to the same terms ahead of further negotiations expected this week. Some officials have suggested that Tehran is dragging its feet, fearing that its response could trigger a wider war. One diplomat said he believed Hezbollah and Iran had “trapped themselves” in their own vows of reprisals.

In a joint announcement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) named them as Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell and Yagev Buchshtab. All but Munder had been announced dead in recent months by the Israeli military. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a “complex operation” to retrieve the bodies. “We will continue working to achieve the goals of this war - returning the hostages to Israel and dismantling Hamas,” Gallant said on X. A joint statement by the ISA and IDF said the operation was “enabled by precise intelligence” from the two agencies’ intelligence units, and the IDF Intelligence Directorate Hostage Headquarters. There are currently 109 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office.

Munder was taken along with his wife, daughter and grandson, who were later freed during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder’s son, Roee, was killed during the attack. Nine-year-old Ohad Munder told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 on Tuesday that the death of his grandfather and the other hostages “shouldn’t have happened.” “There have already been many times when there were negotiations for (a) deal… and then they say no – and in the end they don’t want it, and always regret it at the last minute. All the hostages could have returned alive even on the first day. They could have brought back grandfather and all the other hostages,” Ohad said. Metzger’s wife Tami was also kidnapped and later released in the November truce. Popplewell, who was 51 when abducted, and Buchshtab, 35, were taken from Kibbutz Nirim, the kibbutz said in a statement. In May, Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed Popplewell, a dual British-Israeli citizen, had died more than a month earlier of wounds he sustained after an Israeli airstrike hit the place where he was held. CNN was not able to independently verify the claim by Hamas. The IDF said in July that Buchshtab was believed to have been held in Khan Younis and died several months ago, while the IDF was operating there. It did not detail the circumstances of the death at the time. In a statement Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked those involved in the retrieval operation for their “bravery and determined action.” “Our hearts ache for the terrible loss,” he said. IDF to probe cause of deaths The chief spokesperson of the IDF said Tuesday it was investigating what caused the deaths of the hostages. Earlier on Tuesday, a report in the Israeli media had claimed that some of the fatalities may have been linked to an Israeli military operation in Khan Younis. Israeli outlet Ynet had reported that an IDF preliminary assessment was that the hostages may have died due to suffocation after the IDF hit a nearby Hamas target and carbon dioxide flooded the tunnel where they were being held. Asked in a news conference whether the IDF had killed the hostages, spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari referred back to a statement he made in June, when he had said the “the hostages were killed while our forces were operating in Khan Younis.” However, he did not confirm that the hostages had been killed as a result of Israeli military action. Hagari said the IDF would need to “find out all the details and these bodies are in Israel, they will be brought for burial but were also examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine.” The IDF would inform the families and the public of its findings, Hagari said. The chief spokesperson also said the IDF would not be able to return all hostages through rescue operations, which is why Israel is active “on all channels.” About 1,200 Israelis were killed and some 250 others kidnapped during Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, according to Israeli authorities. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 92,000 injured during Israel’s war in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. Ceasefire talks The news comes as negotiations for a ceasefire continue, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that Netanyahu agreed on Monday to a US “bridging proposal” for a deal after the pair met in Tel Aviv. Mediators presented the bridging proposal to Israel and Hamas last week to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides, a joint statement between the United States, Qatar and Egypt said. Blinken said the next step in the ceasefire talks “is for Hamas to say yes.” He arrived in Egypt on Tuesday for talks with top officials to “get the latest from them on what they are hearing” from Hamas, Blinken said. Further high-level negotiations are expected to resume as soon as this week in either the Egyptian or Qatari capital. The same day, representatives of an Israeli hostage family forum said Netanyahu told them that Israel would not leave the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer strip of land that serves as a buffer zone on the border between Egypt and Gaza, and had also appeared to cast doubt on a hostage and ceasefire deal. Netanyahu said in the meeting that there “might not be a deal,” but the remark came in the context of Hamas potentially ruling out an agreement, the Tikva forum’s Zvika Mor, father of hostage Eitan Mor, told CNN. Mor added that Netanyahu had insisted on maintaining Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor, but had not committed to maintaining control over the Netzarim corridor — which intersects one of Gaza’s two main north-south roads to create a strategic, central junction. Sham Abu Tabaq, age five, saw her father and sister shot dead in front of her. CNN Related article She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter. Then soldiers brought her to an Israeli hospital In a statement released after the meeting, Netanyahu’s office did not directly mention either the prime minister’s reported comments regarding the Philadelphi Corridor or the possibility of no deal. Meanwhile, Hamas rebuked US President Joe Biden’s comments about the group “backing off” from a ceasefire deal. Speaking to reporters outside the Democratic National Convention early Tuesday, Biden said: “Israel says they can work it out, they’re prepared – but I was told Hamas is now backing off. It remains to be seen, we’re going to keep pushing.” Hamas said in a Tuesday statement that “Biden and Blinken’s statements are misleading claims, and do not reflect the true position of the movement, which is keen to reach a cessation of aggression.” “We consider these statements a renewed American green light for the government of Zionist extremists to commit more crimes against defenseless civilians, and in pursuit of the goals of exterminating and displacing our people,” it added. Hamas has previously indicated it will not accept the latest proposal, saying on Sunday that it doesn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions in the prisoner exchange, among other issues. In a statement Sunday, the militant group blamed Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum said Tuesday that the recovery of hostage bodies provided “necessary closure,” and called for urgency to finalize a deal. “The Israeli government, with the assistance of mediators, must do everything in its power to finalize the deal currently on the table,” it said in a statement. Still, Israel’s military operation continues, with airstrikes across Gaza killing at least 40 on Tuesday, officials in the Palestinian enclave said. At least eight people were killed and four people remain missing, according to the Gaza Civil Defense, after an Israeli airstrike targeted a school where authorities said thousands of displaced people were sheltering from violence. Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN most of those killed and injured in the strike on the Mustafa Hafez school were women and children and that a number of people were still under the rubble. The IDF said in a statement that the Israeli Air Force had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control center” inside the school and that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.” Israeli forces have repeatedly targeted schools used as shelters for civilians in Gaza, claiming that Hamas is operating inside the compounds. Later Tuesday, at least nine people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the central city of Deir al-Balah, according to health officials at the city’s Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. Arwa Damon, a former CNN senior international correspondent and president and founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA), who is in central Gaza, heard the strike and saw a number of injured people while she was at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Damon told CNN she saw two blood-covered children, a woman screaming on a stretcher, a man with a massive foot injury and a number of women wailing. In a separate incident, at least four people were killed in a strike on a house in Khan Younis under which a makeshift phone-charging point was located, health officials at Nasser Hospital, which received the casualties, told CNN. The phone-charging station that was hit is one of many in Gaza that sell mobile accessories and allow others to charge their phones for a fee. The stations are primarily for people who live in tents and do not have electricity. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. This story has been updated with additional information.

Blinken was responding to Israeli media reports that Netanyahu told a group of families of terror victims and hostages that he conveyed to Blinken that Israel will not leave the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border and the Netzarim corridor, which bisects Gaza, “regardless of the pressure to do so.” They are “strategic military and political assets,” Netanyahu added, according to the reports. Blinken and other US officials have declined to detail the proposal the US laid out last week. The ceasefire deal is structured in three phases and would eventually include the full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza. But Israeli officials have repeatedly insisted that a solution must be found to better control the Egypt-Gaza border, which has long been used for smuggling. The location of troops in the Philadelphi corridor and the question of whether Palestinians will be able to able to return home in the north have been two of the biggest hurdles in the ceasefire negotiations. Hamas has insisted that the IDF withdraw fully from Gaza and that citizens must be allowed to return home. Blinken said that Netanyahu told him directly in their meeting that Israel agreed to “the bridging proposal and thus the detailed plan” for withdrawal. A US senior administration official strongly pushed back on Netanyahu’s comments about not withdrawing, calling them “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line.” Blinken was speaking in Qatar at the end of a short trip to the region as the US makes what it hopes is a final push for all sides to agree to ceasefire agreement that would halt the fighting in Gaza and free the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The top US diplomat said Monday in Israel that the onus was now on Hamas to also agree to the latest proposal to bridge the outstanding issues. Following top-level meetings in Doha last week, follow on negotiations meant to hammer out the final details of a potential agreement between Hamas and Israel have continued with experts from the different sides. The senior negotiators, including CIA Director Bill Burns, are expected to re-convene in Cairo later in the week or over the weekend. Even as US officials stress the urgency of the need for an agreement, they have begun to downplay the prospects of a full-fledged agreement being reached quickly. On Tuesday, the top US diplomat noted that even if the bridging agreement is agreed by Hamas and Israel, “we also have to complete the detailed implementation agreements that go along with putting the ceasefire into effect” and urged flexibility. Once Hamas agrees to the proposal, Blinken said, it will be “very important that everyone do what’s necessary to bring the flexibility to the table to make sure that we can get the implementation agreed.” Blinken referred back to the so-called Tokyo Principles that state the US will not accept “any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel.” Blinken wrapped his trip the region on Tuesday with stops in Egypt and Qatar. A senior administration official said he had “very productive” meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, and intel chief Abbas Kamel. Blinken was slated to meet with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani in Doha Tuesday night, but the meeting was canceled. A US official said the Qatari leader was unwell. The top US diplomat instead met with Minister of State Dr. Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi. On Monday, Blinken met in Israel with Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog. On Tuesday, Hamas released a statement criticizing both the top US diplomat and President Joe Biden as being “misleading” about the group’s position on a ceasefire agreement. The statement also asserted that mediators in Egypt and Qatar “know that (Hamas) dealt positively and responsibly in all previous rounds of negotiations,” and again blamed Netanyahu for obstruction. A senior administration official on Tuesday suggested that Hamas has not sent a formal response to the bridging proposal, noting that Egypt wants to see a response from the group as soon as possible. The official also stressed that even if both sides agree to the bridging proposal, there will still need to be additional conversations on specific details and technical and implementation commitments. “We fully expect as the conversations will continue, part of the next step if Hamas were to also accept this bridging proposal, is that discussions will continue on some of the more the more technical details,” they said. Still, there is “a fierce urgency of now,” Blinken said Monday, noting that “intervening events come along that may make things even more difficult, if not impossible.” This is “probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken said in remarks earlier Monday."

Behind her dark eyes are memories she has hardly begun to process. She has experienced war. She has been forced from her home. And she was in her father’s arms when he was fatally shot, and saw both him and her older sister left for dead in the street. But this is not your increasingly typical story of tragedy and loss in Gaza . That much is clear from the place where CNN met Sham and her mother, Sanaa: a Palestinian hospital in Jerusalem. And then, there’s this: Sanaa doesn’t just blame the Israeli military for killing her husband and daughter and shooting her in the leg – though certainly she does blame the Israeli military. An Israeli soldier may also have saved her life. That should not be extraordinary. All militaries are obligated under international law to help injured civilians. But in the war in Gaza, stories like Sanaa’s are exceedingly rare. “He had mercy towards us,” she said of the soldier. But he and his comrades, she said, “also took from me the most precious thing I had.” Sham Abu Tabaq, 5, was in her father's arms when he was shot dead, her mother says. CNN Sanaa and her husband Akram – a schoolteacher – lived with their daughters Sham and Yasmeen in Beit Lahia, in the northernmost end of Gaza. She worked at a foundation that provides support for orphans. Like many women in Gaza, she dressed conservatively and often covered her face, which is marked by deep burn scars from a childhood accident. In the days after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, and Israel’s ensuing military campaign, the family were forced from their home – fleeing Israel’s unprecedented bombardment of the Gaza Strip. When a brief ceasefire was announced in late November as part of a hostage release deal, they saw an opportunity to return. “We were so happy we weren’t even able to sleep,” Sanaa recalled. “A truce was happening, and we were going to go home.” They departed the United Nations-run health clinic where they had been living, in the Jabalya refugee camp, and began the roughly three-mile journey on foot. They were almost home, she said, when shots rang out. “It was like there was a sniper and he was shooting at us. We didn’t see him,” she said. “Suddenly we were all injured.” Sanaa Abu Tabaq, who suffered burns as a child, saw her husband and daughter shot dead during the November ceasefire in Gaza. CNN ‘They finished him off’ Seven-year-old Yasmeen’s condition was the most serious. She was shot in the back and shoulder. Akram was struck in the stomach, and Sanaa in the leg. Only Sham was left unscathed by the hail of bullets. Jiab Suleiman distributes food to children living in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, in April.

And Yasmeen was in a very terrible condition – two bullets, and she was all covered in blood. So, I told him, ‘We can’t.’ He said, “I’ll try to crawl.’ So he crawled a little bit. They finished him off! He remained in his place. He was killed,” Sanaa said. For several hours they lay there in the middle of the street – too injured and fearful to move. Sanaa held Yasmeen, promising her daughter that an ambulance was on the way and that they would survive. But no help was on the way. False hope was all Sanaa could offer her daughter in that moment. Life drained out of Yasmeen, and she succumbed to her wounds. Sanaa was unable to retrieve her daughter Yasmeen's body. Sanaa Abu Tabaq “I laid my daughter Yasmeen on the ground, may God bless her soul. And I covered her with a blouse. And I told Sham, ‘Come on darling, let’s crawl.’” Crawling along the ground, speaking in whispers, they left behind the bodies of their family and made it inside a partially bombed two-story house. They huddled in a bathroom as night fell. “In the morning, around 7:30, we heard the sounds of the Israelis and of the tanks,” Sanaa said. “I told her, ‘Sham my darling, the Israelis have come. They are going to shoot us. But don’t be afraid. It’s over. And we are going to die.’ She said, ‘Okay mom, but hide me. I don’t want to see them when they come and shoot me.’” As Sanaa cradled her daughter, an explosion shook the house, blowing in the door of the bathroom where they were huddled and shattering the window above them, sending glass raining down. Soon, the soldiers were inside the house. After some tense moments of shouting, she said, the soldiers were convinced that Sanaa and Sham were not harboring militants and tended to their wounds.

The video, which does not have audio, shows two soldiers applying field dressings as Sanaa – curled in a corner – speaks with someone off-camera. The IDF would not make any of the soldiers concerned available for an interview with CNN. Sanaa soon began pleading with an Arabic-speaking soldier, who denied that his forces had killed Sanaa’s husband and eldest daughter, and instead blamed Hamas and its leader, Yahya Sinwar, for their deaths.

I just want my family to take my daughter.’” “He told me, ‘No, we cannot hand you over to Gaza. Wait a little bit. I might be able to help you,’” Sanaa said. Sanaa says the Israeli soldiers concluded they could not treat her in the field. Her condition was critical, she says, and she needed to be treated in a hospital. After making several calls, she recalled, the Arabic-speaking soldier said they would take them to a hospital in Israel. They carried her out of the house on a stretcher with Sham. As she was being loaded onto a Humvee, Sanaa says she saw her daughter Yasmeen’s body in the street. “I told him: ‘This is Yasmeen. Please bring her to me.’ He said no. I told him, ‘Then, please bury her for me,’” Sanaa recalled. “They kept going with the stretcher.” A shoe on the floor of the house in northern Gaza where Sham and Sanaa sheltered over a terrifying night in November.

Standing in an open area, soldiers doing a security check ordered Sanaa to remove her jilbab – a full-body covering garment – in front of female soldiers, while male soldiers said they would look away. All the while, she continued to bleed from the bullet wound to her leg. “Then they made me lift off my blouse and my undergarment items,” she recalled. “Sham – they took off all her clothes as well.” “If it was not for Sham, I wouldn’t have agreed to take off my clothes. Because I was scared that if I didn’t take off my clothes, they would shoot Sham. Or they would shoot me in front of Sham, and I would never know what happened to her. If I had been alone I would have rather they shoot me, and I wouldn’t have taken off my clothes.” They continued to Kaplan Medical Center, in the central Israeli city of Rehovot, where doctors treated her wounds. CNN obtained Sanaa’s medical files, which show that a bullet pierced her right calf, fracturing both bones and damaging an artery. She was then transported to a Palestinian hospital in Jerusalem to recover. ‘This is God who stood by my side’ For nine months, she has had a slow recovery, with physical therapy. She and Sham have lived in a single, shared hospital room. She has no idea what happened to the bodies of her daughter and husband. It is a vexing limbo – aware of the privilege of their safety yet pining for a home and life that has been irrevocably changed. And she is terrified at being sent back into the warzone that was her home. Indeed, Israeli authorities are now planning on returning the pair to Gaza next month unless another government takes them in, according to hospital officials, Israeli officials and human rights organizations. The Israeli military denies its soldiers shot Sanaa and her family. In a statement to CNN, the IDF said that the family inadvertently approached a concealed Israeli position. When soldiers shouted at the family to stop, their position was revealed to nearby militants, who began firing on the Israelis. The family, the IDF said, was “caught in the intense exchange of fire,” adding that “the troops did not open fire at the four people nor did they aim at them.” A mug with a image of Akram Abu Tabaq, Sham’s father and Sanaa’s husband, who was shot dead while trying to return home during the November ceasefire in Gaza. CNN Sanaa called that claim a lie. The IDF claimed that the militants fired grenades on their position – Sanaa said she did not hear any explosions. “If we had heard the voice of Israelis, we would have fled and returned (to the shelter). If we had heard the voice of resistance, we would have fled and returned,” Sanaa said. “It’s true he helped me,” Sanaa says of the Arab-speaking soldier who helped facilitate the decision to take her out of Gaza, to Israel. But she cannot bring herself to thank him. And she says she would not, if she saw him again. “This was a miracle from God that the soldier who was speaking to me in Arabic was helping me,” she said. “This is God who stood by my side, and He put mercy in them towards me. It is from God,” she said. “Not by (the soldier’s) own will.” Video Ad Feedback Watch CNN’s full video story 06:43 - Source: CNN This story has been updated."

Despite the claims of Netanyahu’s agreement to the bridging proposal, there are still significant challenges before a deal can actually be reached. Not only has Hamas not agreed to the proposal but negotiators are still working on specific details on how an agreement would be implemented. They are also working to establish “clear understandings on how the different parties are going to make good on their commitments,” the top US diplomat said. Ahead of his meetings with Israeli officials Monday, Blinken said the push to finalize a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza has reached a “decisive moment,” as he visited Israel before going on to Egypt and Qatar on Tuesday. This is “probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken said in remarks alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv before the two met. “It is time for everyone to get to yes, and to not look for any excuses to say no,” Blinken said. “It is time for it to get done. It’s also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process.” At his press conference, Blinken underscored the urgency of the moment, noting that “intervening events come along that may make things even more difficult, if not impossible.” “We’ve experienced that throughout this process, so there’s the fierce urgency of now,” he said. The announcement by Blinken and the Israeli prime minister’s office that Israel had agreed to the bridging proposal followed a three-hour meeting between the top US diplomat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem earlier Monday. Both sides described the meeting as constructive. Netanyahu committed to sending senior negotiators to “complete this process” in either Qatar or Egypt, Blinken said. It is unclear what exactly is in the “bridging proposal.” It was put forward last week by the US, with the support of Qatar and Egypt, following two days of high-stakes talks in Doha. The mediators have been stepping up efforts as the Middle East braces for a possible Iranian attack on Israel, and after the death toll since October in Gaza reportedly reached 40,000 people — a bleak figure that underscores 10 months of suffering, malnutrition and despair in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s war with Hamas. On Sunday evening, Hamas and Netanyahu traded accusations suggesting that a deal may still be far off. Hamas suggested it had rejected the proposal. Hamas said the latest proposal didn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions on the exchange of prisoners, among other issues. The group blamed Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached and reiterated its desire to enact a three-phase proposal presented by US President Joe Biden, which would include the release of hostages from Gaza, a “full and complete ceasefire,” and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It called on mediators to “compel the occupation to implement” that plan. Netanyahu shot back, saying Israel will not be “giving in to Hamas’s demand” to end the war in Gaza as a condition of a deal. “The Prime Minister has strongly insisted on this fundamental demand, which is vital to achieving the goals of the war, and Hamas changed its position,” a statement from his office said Sunday. “The Prime Minister will continue to work on advancing a deal that will maximize the number of living hostages and which will enable the achieving of all of the war objectives.” At his news conference Monday, Blinken said he could not “speculate on exactly what Hamas’s intentions are,” but expected to learn more in his conversations with Egyptian and Qatari officials on Tuesday. “We’ve seen public statements, but we’ve seen public statements before that don’t fully reflect where Hamas is,” he said. Other key sticking points in talks include Israel’s insistence on controlling the border between Gaza and Egypt, having a veto over which Palestinian prisoners are released and preventing the movement of armed men from southern Gaza to the north. Death toll continues to rise As the diplomatic efforts continue, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. At least 15 people were killed in two separate Israeli strikes on Gaza Monday, including seven former bodyguards of the late Hamas political bureau leader Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN. The strike on the Al-Shati refugee camp northwest of Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip killed nine people, including the bodyguards, according to Basal. The second strike hit an area behind the Austrian Towers - residential buildings west of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, killing at least six people and injuring 15 others, Basal said. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on both incidents for comment. Separately, an Israeli soldier was killed in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced in a short statement Monday. IDF said earlier Monday that its troops “expanded the operation in the Gaza Strip to the Khan Yunis area and the outskirts of Deir al-Balah,” in a statement. “The troops are eliminating terrorists, destroying combat compounds above and below ground,” the statement added.

Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images A ‘fraught moment’ for Israel Speaking alongside Herzog on Monday, Blinken acknowledged it is a “fraught moment” for Israel over concerns about the possibility of attacks from Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, and said the US has “taken decisive actions… to deter any attacks and if necessary to defend against any attacks.” “We’re working to make sure that there is no escalation, there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places and to greater intensity,” he said. As Blinken arrived in Israel on Sunday, there was an explosion in Tel Aviv that Israeli officials declared to be a terror attack. Hamas’ armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the explosion. In the evening, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed seven members of the same family, medical officials said. Six children and their mother were killed in the strike on a home in Deir al-Balah, according to the Al-Aqsa hospital. The children’s father was injured, a hospital spokesperson said. It comes just a day after an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people, all from the same family, in the al-Zawayda area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Nine children were among those killed, according to the Gaza Civil Defense. In a statement Sunday, the Israeli military said forces continue to operate in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.

Hamas’s armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the explosion, in a statement on its Telegram account. Police said the person suspected of carrying the explosive material was killed, while a passerby sustained injuries. “This was a terror attack involving the explosion of a powerful explosive,” the Israel Police Spokesperson’s Unit and the Shin Bet Spokesperson’s Unit said in a joint statement Monday. “As a result of the explosion, a passerby was moderately injured (according to medical sources) and was transported to receive medical treatment,” it added. A police official told CNN early Monday that “a major disaster was averted, and dozens could have been killed.” The official refused to comment on what may have been the intended target. Later Monday, police in Tel Aviv said that the suspect who carried out the explosion had no criminal record and was unknown to security forces. After the blast, the Tel Aviv District Commander conducted “extensive searches” throughout the greater city area, the joint statement said. Police said they had received dozens of calls reporting the loud explosion on HaLehi Street. Hamas said the “martyrdom operation” was carried out in cooperation with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s armed wing, the Al-Quds Brigades. “The Brigades confirm that martyrdom operations inside the occupied territories will return to the forefront as long as the occupation’s massacres, the displacement of civilians, and the continuation of the policy of assassinations continue,” its statement added. The blast comes as the city remains on high alert amid rising regional tensions related to the war in Gaza. It was unclear whether the act was linked to the complex security situation.

Six children and their mother were killed in the airstrike on a home in Deir al-Balah on Sunday, according to the Al-Aqsa hospital. The children’s father was injured, a hospital spokesperson said. Muhammad Awad Khattab, the children’s grandfather, told CNN: “They were taken by surprise when a missile hit them and completely destroyed their apartment.” “What did they do to deserve this?” he added. “What resistance did they have?” As the war rages in Gaza, Blinken landed in Israel on Sunday night where he will, in the words of a senior administration official, “continue to stress the importance of getting this [deal] done.” The top US diplomat will meet on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and President Isaac Herzog, according to a senior State Department official. Following his meetings in Israel, Blinken will continue on to Egypt on Tuesday. Cairo has been a key negotiator in the ceasefire talks. The fresh strike in Gaza comes just a day after an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people, all from the same famly, in the al-Zawayda area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Nine children were among those killed, according to Gaza Civil Defense. In a statement Sunday, the Israeli military said forces continue to operate in Khan Younis and Dir al-Balah. It said the military struck “targets in the area from which the launches were fired toward Nirim (Friday) and destroyed loaded launchers in the area of Khan Younis.” The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders in north Khan Younis and east Deir al-Balah on Friday, further reducing the boundaries of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone. Palestinians in Gaza have faced constant evacuation orders. According to the UN, since October of last year, more than 80% of the Gaza Strip has been subjected to such orders, severely impacting the local population’s access to essential services and shelter. Israel’s campaign in Gaza – launched following the Hamas attacks of October 7 – has killed more than 40,000 people and reduced much of the territory to rubble. Adding to Gazans’ woes, doctors this week detected the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years. Peace efforts accelerate Blinken’s arrival comes amid urgent efforts to finalize an elusive Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. A new ceasefire plan drawn up by the US, Qatar and Egypt was presented on Friday following two days of high stakes talks in Doha. Mediators have been stepping up efforts amid fears of Iranian retaliation for the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Blinken’s visit has become an established pattern from the top US diplomat of traveling for in-person meetings to project high-level public pressure around the need for an agreement. The senior administration official would not say how the US intends to pressure the Israeli government to take the deal. “Think it is apparent that a deal would not only be in the interest of the Israeli people, but would also help alleviate some of the suffering in Gaza. We’re going to raise all of these issues directly,” they told the press traveling with Blinken. US officials including President Joe Biden have expressed fresh optimism of finalizing a ceasefire agreement. However, Hamas has dismissed the progress, with a senior official from the militant group telling the BBC that mediators were “selling illusions.” In a statement issued on Sunday, the militant group blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached. It said the latest proposal made following high-stakes discussions between mediators in Doha does not include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions in the prisoner exchange, among other issues. “After listening to the mediators about the recent round of talks in Doha, it became clear to us once again that Netanyahu continues to place obstacles to reaching an agreement, sets new conditions and demands in order to thwart the efforts of the mediators and prolong the war,” Hamas said in a statement. “The new proposal meets Netanyahu’s conditions and is in line with them, especially his refusal to a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and his insistence on continuing the occupation of Netzarim Junction and the Rafah Crossing and Philadelphi Corridor. He also introduced new conditions in the prisoner exchange file and backtracked on other terms, hindering the completion of the exchange deal,” the Hamas statement read. “We hold Netanyahu fully responsible for thwarting the mediators’ efforts, obstructing reaching an agreement, and the full responsibility for the lives of his soldiers who are exposed to the same danger our people face, due to his continued aggression and deliberate targeting of all aspects of life in the Gaza Strip,” the statement continued. Hamas reiterated its desire to enact a three-phase proposal introduced by Biden, which would include the release of hostages from Gaza, a “full and complete ceasefire,” and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The organization called on mediators to “compel the occupation to implement” that plan. Previously, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office had said the Israeli negotiating team was still cautiously optimistic about reaching a ceasefire-hostage deal. A statement from the PMO on Saturday said there was “hope that the heavy pressure” on Hamas from the United States and mediators will “allow a breakthrough in negotiations.” Speaking at the beginning of the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel is “holding very complex negotiations” for the release of “our hostages.” Calling the return of hostages a national mission of the highest order, Netanyahu said Israel must negotiate with a “murderous terrorist organization that is unbridled and obstinate.” A statement released later from Netanyahu’s office said Israel would not be “giving in to Hamas’s demand” to end the war in Gaza as a condition of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. “The prime minister has strongly insisted on this fundamental demand, which is vital to achieving the goals of the war, and Hamas changed its position,” the statement said. Netanyahu also insisted on remaining in the Philadelphi Corridor “in order to prevent terrorist elements from rearming.” “The prime minister will continue to work on advancing a deal that will maximize the number of living hostages and which will enable the achieving of all of the war objectives,” the Israeli statement added.

All of those killed in Lebanon were Syrian nationals. A woman and her two children are among the dead, according to the ministry. The strike also wounded at least five. They include three Syrians, one Sudanese and one Lebanese, the ministry said. Two of the Syrians are in critical condition and undergoing surgery at a nearby hospital. Israel’s military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the area of Nabatiyeh overnight. The death toll from the strike is one of the largest in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its war on Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7 that killed around 1,200 people. Mohamed, 14, was about to go to sleep when he saw a missile hit a warehouse nearby. He told CNN that rescuers worked through the night to retrieve the dead bodies from under the rubble, where they found a decapitated body and a severed arm. Pointing to the sky buzzing with the sound of an unseen drone, Mohamed said: “They are always flying over here 24/7, sometimes they fly so low you can see them.” Referring to the victims, who are believed to all be Syrian migrants, Haitham, a Syrian national guard at a nearby company, said: “They escaped one war and got killed in another.” Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon launched a volley of rockets towards Ayelet Hashahar in northern Israel in response to the strike, the group said in a statement.

Aziz Taher/Reuters Israel’s military confirmed that sirens had sounded in Ayelet Hashahar after “approximately 55 projectiles” crossed from Lebanon. “No injuries were reported,” the Israel Defence Forces said. In a separate incident, the IDF said one of its soldiers was severely injured and another lightly wounded after a projectile from Lebanon fell in Misgav Am. Also on Saturday, a drone struck and killed a person on a motorcycle in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, according to Lebanon’s state-owned National News Agency (NNA). Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been exchanging almost daily cross-border fire since Israel launched its war on Gaza, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in 10 months. Tensions between Lebanon and Israel deepened further late last month when an Israeli strike on Lebanese capital Beirut killed the top military commander for Hezbollah, Fu’ad Shukr. Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas’ political leader the next day in Tehran, Iran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in that incident. An industrial area destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Nabatiyeh. Mohammad Zaatari/AP This has prompted speculation of looming retaliatory attacks on Israel by Hezbollah and Iran. Two sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN earlier this month that Hezbollah looks increasingly like it may strike Israel, independent of what Iran may intend to do. Given Lebanon’s proximity to Israel as its direct neighbor to the north, Hezbollah could act with little to no notice, one of the sources said – which is not true of Iran. 15 members of same family killed in Gaza On the ground in Gaza, an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people from the same family in al-Zawayda, in the central part of the enclave, a spokesperson for the local civil defense said Saturday. Nine children were among the dead. CNN video on site shows people searching the rubble and pulling out the body of a child in the morning. When asked by CNN to comment on the incident, the Israeli military said “reports that civilians were injured as a result of the strike is under review.” In a later statement released on Saturday, the IDF said it killed several militants in central Gaza, including one who launched rockets toward Israeli troops. Fighting in Gaza has reduced much of the territory to rubble and displaced almost the entire population. Israel issued new evacuation orders in central Gaza on Saturday, the ninth across Gaza in August alone. The UN has warned such orders severely impact the local population’s access to essential services and shelter. Meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike in the West Bank town of Jenin on Saturday killed two commanders of the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. The Qassam Brigades said the strike had targeted a vehicle carrying the two men, whom it said had planned and executed multiple attacks, including a gunfire attack in the Jordan Valley in the West Bank on August 11 that killed a 23-year-old man. Earlier on Saturday, the IDF confirmed hitting the vehicle, identifying the men killed as “the terrorist Ahmed Abu Arrah from Aqabah” and “the terrorist Raafat Dawasi from Silat al-Harithiya.” ‘Cautious optimism’ on truce talks: Israel On Friday hostage and truce talks ended and are due to resume next week. International mediators presented a new proposal intended to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between Israel and Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Saturday its negotiating team is still cautiously optimistic about reaching a ceasefire-hostage deal. “The team expressed cautious optimism to the prime minister regarding the possibility of moving forward with the deal, based on the latest American proposal (which is based on the May 27 outline) – and includes elements acceptable to Israel,” the office said in a statement. “There is hope that the heavy pressure on Hamas from the United States and the mediators will lead to the removal of its opposition to the American proposal, and will allow a breakthrough in negotiations,” the statement said.

It was the first time members of the Palestinian women’s soccer team had met since the start of the war in Gaza, an ongoing trauma for Palestinians inside and outside the enclave. The team was en route to Dublin, Ireland – the first time a senior Palestinian women’s team had ever played in Europe. “Everyone was crying at the airport because that’s literally the only way for we sisters to meet. No one is playing. People are dying,” the 26-year-old – who plays as a winger for the team – later told CNN on the phone from her home in the West Bank. This season’s Palestinian-based women’s league was slated to start on October 9, 2023, two days after Hamas’ devastating assault on Israel, that prompted a military campaign that has so far killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than a million more. After months of fearing for their relatives and friends inside Gaza, the team finally got their 90 minutes of solace, kicking off against local Irish club Bohemians FC in May. Palestinian soccer player Bisan Abuaita Palestinian Football Association Adding extra significance to the match, it was played on the 76th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba , or catastrophe, during which approximately 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes or were expelled by Jewish militia groups, in violence that accompanied the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Thousands of Palestinian flag-waving fans filled Dalymount Park, with the proceeds going to charitable organizations to help refugees back home. Irish President Michael Higgins was among those in attendance. Just two weeks after the match was played, Ireland would go on to recognize Palestinian statehood , in a coordinated move with two other European nations, Spain and Norway, a decision that was condemned by Israel . Ireland is considered one of the most pro-Palestinian nations in Europe, and earlier this year filed an intervention in the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The Palestinian side won the match 2-1, but the result was less important than the game itself. “Leading the team out was unforgettable,” said 25-year-old captain Mira Natour, a doctor who will soon return to her native Bethlehem in the West Bank, where she works in a government hospital. “It was a moment that filled me with enormous pride and a heavy sense of achievement. Not just for me, but the entire team and our nation. It was a symbol of our resilience; representing Palestine on the international stage despite all the challenges we face.” Palestinian women's team captain Mira Natour Palestinian Football Association Teammate Abuaita, who travels between Bethlehem and France to help displaced Palestinian women and children, described the “surreal” moment of being able to return to competitive soccer. She had barely kicked a ball since her local club won the Palestinian Cup the previous year. “It felt amazing,” she said. “Wearing the kit gives me goosebumps. With what’s happening lately, it’s like double the goosebumps. “Everyone was crying when we heard the national anthem (pre-match) because you remember everything and everyone that you’re playing for. Each one of us knows people who are suffering, who (have been) martyred.” ‘Sisters’ assemble The Palestinian players traveled to Ireland from far and wide – some from their homes in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and others from the global diaspora living thousands of miles from the site of the conflict. Five players from the West Bank, including Abuaita, had to drive to Jordan and fly from Amman. There are no airports in the Palestinian territories and the women would have needed a permit to fly from Israel’s Tel Aviv airport. Even though the distance to Jordan’s Queen Alia Airport is relatively short, three separate security checkpoints along the way meant the trip took around 10 hours, Abuaita said. But at least they could travel. Since the team’s establishment in 2013, there has yet to be a Palestine women’s team member from Gaza, due to Israel’s blockade of the enclave. “Unfortunately, we don’t have players from Gaza on our team. One of the main reasons why is the blockade that was forced upon Gazans since 2007,” said team manager Deema Yousef. “This means citizens cannot leave the strip without a permit granted by the Israeli government, which is extremely hard to obtain,” said Yousef, a representative of the Palestinian Football Association. Other players came from the Palestinian diaspora in Germany, Sweden, Canada and Saudi Arabia.

Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Eighteen-year-old goalkeeper Charlotte Phillips was born in Canada to a Bahamian father and Palestinian mother. Phillips’ grandparents, George and Odette, are Nakba survivors whose family members were killed in front of them, she said. They left Jerusalem in the mid-70s and moved to Canada and went on to open a successful Palestinian restaurant in Toronto, said Phillips, now a university student in Toronto. “I can’t always fully relate to the struggles,” Phillips said. “I know what it means to be Palestinian in Canada, but I don’t know what it means to be Palestinian living in occupied Palestine. So, playing in a game like that in front of my teta (grandmother) and sidi (grandfather) was so significant to our family history.” Nonetheless each meetup of the team, like the match in Ireland, is charged. “It was so incredibly emotional,” Phillips recalled. ‘We are still fighting’ Both Natour and Abuaita described the team’s bittersweet feeling of clocking valuable minutes on the field, while remembering those struggling in war-torn Gaza. Abuaita said her team plays as a mark of respect for those killed in the conflict, and as a reminder to the world that Palestinians are still fighting. “We play for all those people who were killed, for those footballers and athletes who were murdered. And for those athletes who are still unable to play, because in Gaza now there’s zero stadiums – they were all destroyed. Being able to show people we’re here and that we’re still fighting in Palestine is an honor,” she said. Palestinian players celebrate their first goal during the international solidarity match between Bohemians and Palestine at Dalymount Park in Dublin. Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Since the game in Dublin, both the Palestinian men’s and women’s teams have played a handful of international friendly matches, with the former still in contention for a place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada after an impressive outing in the Asian group stages this summer. “Football is a source of hope and unity for our people. It allows us to tell our story – we are more than just a conflict,” captain Natour said. “Most importantly, it inspires the younger generation to dream and strive for a better future, no matter what. When I look at my teammates with diverse backgrounds and unique talents, (I realize) we’re not just athletes but role models and advocates for our country, both on and off the field.”"

Both France and the UK, however, have downplayed such a prospect, with the UK emphasizing the need to break the “current destructive cycle of retaliatory violence” in the Middle East.

Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images When asked about Katz’s statement, a UK foreign office spokesperson stressed that the UK is “working in lockstep with our allies to deescalate tensions,” adding that they “urge all parties to refrain from perpetuating the current destructive cycle of retaliatory violence.” “We call on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that would further escalate regional tensions and jeopardise the opportunity to agree a ceasefire and the release of hostages. No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East,” the spokesperson added. A source with knowledge of Friday’s meeting between the Israeli, French, and UK foreign ministers told CNN that the three ministers “did not discuss joining a coalition for any attack on Iran.” Meanwhile, a senior United States administration official struck a harsher tone, warning on Friday there could be “cataclysmic” consequences and “particularly for Iran” if Tehran decides to strike Israel and escalate the conflict in the Middle East. The death toll in Gaza passed 40,000 people this week, underlining the urgency behind the latest round of talks.

The “bridging proposal” presented on Friday was intended to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides, a joint statement from the US, Qatar and Egypt said. US President Joe Biden expressed optimism about the state of ceasefire and hostage release talks that are expected to resume in Cairo next week. “We are closer than we’ve ever been,” he said, adding that the talks had brought the chances of a deal “much, much closer than it was three days ago.” But the Hamas leadership sees the new US proposal as responding and conforming to Israel’s conditions, a senior Hamas source privy to the details of the negotiations told CNN. The source accused Israel of adding new conditions in order to stall the agreement. Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiating delegation returned to Israel late Friday feeling cautiously optimistic about the prospects of reaching a deal, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. “They narrowed the gaps,” the source said. “These were very productive and positive talks.” The source, however, cautioned that the bridging proposal has yet to be submitted to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza — a process that is expected to occur this weekend. The two days of discussions took place amid tensions across the region about a potential Iranian attack against Israel, which carries the risk of scuppering already fragile negotiations. Biden on Friday also sent a warning message to Iran and Iranian-backed proxies that they should not take any actions “to undermine” the progress of the talks. The US president added that he is sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel this weekend to “reaffirm” the White House’s “iron-clad support for Israel’s security.” Two high-stakes days According to a diplomatic source close to negotiations, the talks were attended both days by CIA director Bill Burns, Mossad chief David Barnea, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence head Abbas Kamel. The joint statement from the US, Qatar and Egypt said the proposal “builds on the areas of agreement over the past week,” and “bridges remaining gaps in a manner that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.” Senior officials from the US, Qatar and Egypt will meet again in Cairo before the end of next week, “with the aim to “conclude the deal under the terms put forward” Friday, the joint statement said. The talks were “serious and constructive,” the statement added, though it did not elaborate on what points of agreement were achieved over the past week. Israel on Friday said it welcomed the mediators’ efforts but did not explicitly endorse the latest proposal on the table. “Israel appreciates the efforts of the US and the mediators to dissuade Hamas from its refusal to a hostage release deal,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement. “Israel’s essential principles are well known to the mediators and the US, and Israel hopes that their pressure will lead Hamas to accept the May 27 principles, so that the details of the agreement can be implemented.” The death toll in Gaza since Israel started its war against Hamas passed 40,000 this week, just as mediators arrived in Doha to discuss a ceasefire. Abed Rahim Khatib/dpa/picture alliance/AP/File Related article High-stakes Gaza ceasefire talks have ended. Here’s what to know Later that evening, an Israeli source told CNN that a working-level delegation has remained in Doha and another working-level delegation is expected to fly to Cairo this weekend to work through the technical details of the implementation of an agreement, the source said. Hamas has not rejected a hostage release deal, as the statement from the PMO suggested. On Thursday it reiterated its stance that there will be no hostage deal or ceasefire agreement without a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The senior Hamas source privy to the details of the negotiations confirmed to CNN that the armed group believes Israel continues to evade and obstruct and insists on adding new conditions to stall the agreement. Hamas did not attend the talks but engaged separately with Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The death toll in Gaza since Israel launched its war against Hamas reached 40,000 people earlier this week, a bleak figure that underscores the desperation in the enclave for a reprieve from ten months of bloody conflict. CNN Related article More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 10 months of war in Gaza, health ministry says But discussions to bring about a pause have been shrouded in uncertainty since Israeli strikes in late July killed Hamas’ former political leader and senior figures in Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. It is understood that both sides have failed to agree on the implementation of the finer details of the proposal. A regional diplomat familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the continued sticking points for Hamas are Israel’s restrictions on the movement of people from southern Gaza to the north, its demand for a veto over which Palestinian prisoners would be released, as well as its continued presence at the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Both Israel and Hamas may be forced to be more flexible in the days ahead in order to reach a deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already facing significant pressure from the US – which is expected to be conveyed during Blinken’s visit to Israel next week – and the Qataris and Egyptians plan on bringing more pressure to bear on Hamas. It is too early to tell if there will be an agreement, but the Israeli source said there is potential for a deal to be announced when top officials convene again mid to late next week. ‘Ready for any possible contingency’ A major Iranian reprisal attack against Israel could still disrupt the ceasefire talks; previous negotiations were at an advanced stage before the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a Hezbollah military commander in Beirut, US officials have said. Iran has blamed on Israel for Haniyeh’s death. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, Iran’s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri expressed skepticism about the integrity of the negotiations, accusing the US of bias in a phone call with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. “By supplying the Zionists with war weapons, the US is itself an accomplice, not a neutral mediator,” Bagheri tweeted. Meanwhile, a senior US administration official has warned that there could be “cataclysmic” consequences and “particularly for Iran” if Tehran decides to strike Israel and escalate the conflict in the Middle East. The official added that the United States has encouraged Iran, through intermediaries, to not attack as there is a “path” to achieve a ceasefire and hostage deal on the table. The de-escalation and potential for a ceasefire deal are “separate,” the official said, but are happening in “parallel.” When asked by CNN’s MJ Lee whether the US would be involved in any attacks on Iran – after Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that he told his British and French counterparts that he expects their nations to attack Iran in the event of an Iranian attack on Israel – the senior administration official sidestepped, saying the situation is “very hypothetical.” “We have deployed the military resources to the region that are needed for every possible contingency, and we’re working in very close coordination with partners and allies,” the official added. “We are ready for any possible contingency, and we’re going to help defend Israel, and not going to get ahead of anything else that.

Blinken’s visit comes on the heels of an initial round of high-level negotiations that wrapped up in Doha on Friday. According to a joint statement from the three main negotiators — the United States, Qatar, and Egypt — the US presented a “bridging proposal” meant to resolve the key gaps remaining between Hamas and Israel in a way “that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.” The statement did not provide specific details about the proposal. “Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Israel on August 17 to continue intensive diplomatic efforts to conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees through the bridging proposal presented today by the United States, with support from Egypt and Qatar,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement. “This proposal would achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, ensure humanitarian assistance is distributed throughout Gaza, and create the conditions for broader regional stability,” he said. “Secretary Blinken will underscore the critical need for all parties in the region to avoid escalation or any other actions that could undermine the ability to finalize an agreement,” Patel said. Blinken’s trip to Israel follows what has become an established pattern from the top US diplomat of traveling for in-person meetings to project high-level public pressure around the need for an agreement. US officials have also consistently argued that a key factor in shifting the Israeli government’s positions related to Gaza has been persistent — and in-person — American engagement. Blinken is expected to meet with key Israeli government officials while in the country. The top US diplomat’s trip follows a parade of other high-level US officials traveling to the region, including CIA Director Bill Burns and top National Security Council official Brett McGurk. The flurry of travel comes as the US and its allies seek to deter a potential retaliatory response from Iran or its proxies for the killing of a top Hamas official in Tehran weeks ago. There are strong concerns that such a response could spark a widespread war."

More than 70 armed settlers invaded the town of Jit on Thursday, firing bullets and tear gas at residents and setting several homes and cars and other property on fire, according to the head of Jit’s village council, Nasser Sedda. Sedda said his cousin, Rashid Sedda, was killed in the attack. The Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health confirmed the 23-year-old Palestinian died after sustaining a chest injury. “We have attacks but nothing to this level,” Sedda told CNN. “We haven’t seen anything like this before, and without a prior warning. They caught the people off guard – women, children, and elders were there.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said dozens of Israeli citizens, some masked, set fires and threw rocks and Molotov cocktails before being dispersed by Israeli security forces. One person has been apprehended for questioning over the rioting, and authorities are looking into the death of the Palestinian resident, the IDF said, without naming the resident.

Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images It is launching a joint investigation into the attack with security agency ISA and Israeli Police. Militant group Hamas on Friday called on Palestinians in the West Bank to “rise up against the crimes of the occupation and to confront the terrorist attacks of settlers” after the raid. “The policy of raids, assassinations, and unleashing herds of settlers will only increase our people’s devotion to their land and sanctities,” it said in a statement. ‘A serious nationalist crime’ Videos of the attack on Jit showed vehicles on fire and flames on the ground floor of a two-story building. Another video shows three medics performing CPR on Rashid Sedda. Residents of the town can be seen running toward the burning vehicles and putting out the flames with a fire extinguisher, while someone shouts, “The settlers attacked us and set fire to the cars.” The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it treated three injuries from settler attacks in the town, including an elderly woman affected by gas inhalation and two young men injured by stones. Disavowal and condemnation came quickly from top Israeli officials. A man standing next to burnt cars points at the damage in his house. Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images A statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack, warning that he views the incident with “utmost severity.” “Those responsible for any offense will be apprehended and tried,” it read. Moshe Arbel, Israel’s interior minister, called the attacks a “serious nationalist crime” that runs “contrary to the values of Judaism,” and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant slammed the “violent, radical riots” as “the opposite of every code and value upheld by the State of Israel.” Israeli soldiers ride in a tank along the border with the Gaza Strip on August 7, 2024.

The attack had harmed “the law-abiding community of settlers and the settlements as a whole and the status of Israel in the world during a particularly sensitive and difficult period,” he said. The attacks meanwhile drew a qualified response from Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister, who said he “told the [IDF] Chief of the General Staff this evening that the fact that we don’t let soldiers shoot any terrorist who throws stones is leading to events of the type that occurred tonight.” “At the same time, it is unequivocally forbidden to take the law into one’s own hands,” he added. Another far-right member of Netanyahu’s government, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “The rioters tonight in Jit are in no way related to the settlements and the settlers. They are criminals who should be dealt with by the law enforcement authorities with the full severity of the law.” Some West Bank settlement leaders also denounced the attacks, seeking to distance themselves from the rioters whom they said were “outsiders.” There has been strong international condemnation too. The European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said the attacks aimed at “terrorizing Palestinian civilians.” “Day after day, in an almost total impunity, Israeli settlers fuel violence in the occupied West Bank, contributing to endanger[ing] any chance of peace,” Borrell wrote in a post on X Friday. Germany’s Foreign Ministry also condemned the attack, writing in a post on X that “this violence is unacceptable and the attacks must stop immediately.” The United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, on Friday called on the Israeli government “to stop settler violence.” A man checks the damage in his house, a day after the attack on the village of Jit. Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images For years, Israeli settlers have attacked Palestinian communities in the occupied territory. From October 7, 2023 to August 5, 2024 alone, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has recorded at least 1,143 settler attacks against Palestinians . Of those, at least 114 attacks “led to Palestinian fatalities and injuries,” according to OCHA. The US imposed a series of sanctions this year on Israeli settlers accused of violence in the West Bank, blocking their financial assets and barring them from entering the US. “The United States remains deeply concerned about extremist violence and instability in the West Bank, which undermines Israel’s own security,” the State Department said in a statement last month. Israeli settlements, primarily inhabited by Jewish Israeli citizens, are built on lands controlled by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. While the international community deems these settlements illegal under international law, Israel disputes this classification. The controversial settler movement has grown in power over the years and is seen by the outside world as a major impediment to peace in the region."

Sign up here. CNN — Mediators in talks for a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel made a last-ditch effort this week to revive stalled negotiations, with high-stakes discussions wrapping up Friday against a backdrop of tension and desperation in the region. The meeting in Doha started on Thursday and has now ended, a diplomat familiar with the discussions told CNN. A breakthrough wasn’t expected but efforts will continue. Technical teams will meet again in the coming days, starting Saturday, until the main figures meet again in Cairo next week, the diplomat said. It took place as the Middle East braces for a possible Iranian attack on Israel , and after the death toll since October in Gaza reached 40,000 people , a bleak figure that underscores 10 months of suffering, malnutrition and despair in the enclave. The fear of an Iranian attack poses a serious threat to any hopes of a ceasefire that have already appeared tenuous in recent weeks, after Israeli strikes took out Hamas’ former political leader and senior figures in Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. But the talks went ahead, despite some initial fears they would be scrapped. Participants on Thursday included CIA director Bill Burns, Mossad chief David Barnea, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence head Abbas Kamel, a diplomatic source close to negotiations told CNN. In the meeting, Qatar, Egypt and the United States were expected to present a plan to implement a deal that could bring about a ceasefire in the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The deal was proposed by US President Joe Biden in May – but unresolved differences have left the path forward unclear. Here’s what we know about the status of the talks. People protest in Tel Aviv ahead of the latest round of talks, calling for a deal that would secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Florion Goga/Reuters What happened in the talks? Mediators presented a bridging proposal to Israel and Hamas to close the remaining gaps of disagreement between both sides, a joint statement between the US, Qatar and Egypt said on Friday after talks wrapped up for the week. The statement, published by the Egyptian presidency and Qatari foreign ministry, said the proposal presented to both sides “builds on the areas of agreement over the past week,” and “bridges remaining gaps in a manner that allows for a swift implementation of the deal.” The talks were “serious and constructive,” the statement said. CNN video Related video Hear from woman who’s husband is still held by Hamas But the statement did not elaborate on what points of agreement were achieved over the past week. Hamas had said it would not participate in talks but engaged separately with Qatari and Egyptian mediators, a source told CNN, adding that the mediators are still working to bridge the gap on the remaining key differences. “Our position was clear… we will not go for new negotiation rounds. We will only go to implement what has been agreed on,” Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told CNN on Tuesday. On Thursday, the militant group reiterated that there will be no hostage deal or ceasefire agreement without a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. What is Biden’s proposal? In May, Biden laid out a three-phase proposal the administration said was submitted by Israel that would pair a release of hostages from Gaza with a “full and complete ceasefire” and a release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The first phase would last six weeks and include the “withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza” and the “release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners” and the implementation of a temporary truce. CNN Related article More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 10 months of war in Gaza, health ministry says Phase 2 would allow for the “exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers” and a permanent end to the fighting. In Phase 3, a “major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who’ve been killed will be returned to their families,” the US president said. Israel launched its war against Hamas after the group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 100 of those hostages remain in Gaza, their families back home pleading for a breakthrough to secure their safe return. It is unclear how many of the original hostages set for release are still alive. Hamas and Israel have been engaged in tedious negotiations for months. Officials from Qatar and Egypt act as intermediaries, delivering messages to Israeli and Hamas representatives in shuttle-style diplomacy since representatives from the warring parties are not present at the same location. Technical teams have flown in and out of Doha and Cairo to iron out details for a potential agreement. What are the key remaining sticking points? Despite an initial positive reaction from Hamas and Israel, both sides failed to agree on the implementation of the finer details of the proposal including the sequencing of the hostage-prisoner exchange, the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released and how far back Israeli forces should withdraw in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of undermining the deal as far-right members of his ruling coalition threaten to collapse the government despite pressure from the US and families of hostages. Throughout the war, the prime minister has been caught between two potent political forces: the far-right members of his governing coalition who have been opposed to any suggestion that Israeli troops should leave Gaza, and the relatives of hostages held by Hamas, who have formed a powerful pressure group and have implored Netanyahu to reach a deal. US President Joe Biden presents a ceasefire proposal at the White House on May 31. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Last month, the prime minister reversed on a key Israeli concession in ceasefire negotiations, demanding that armed men be barred from returning to northern Gaza during an eventual ceasefire, an Israeli source familiar with the talks told CNN. Israel had previously agreed to allow Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza. Netanyahu’s office on Tuesday rejected claims that the prime minister had changed positions, saying his most recent stance “does not introduce extra conditions and certainly does not contradict or undermine” the May proposal. Netanyahu’s office instead accused Hamas of adding unrealistic demands to its position. A regional diplomat familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the remaining sticking points for Hamas are Israel’s restrictions on the movement of people from southern Gaza to the north, its demand for a veto over which Palestinian prisoners would be released, as well as its continued presence at the Philadelphi corridor and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. What is Hamas’ position? US officials had said that talks had reached an advanced stage until Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran in late July in an assassination Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility, but Iran has vowed vengeance. There were concerns that the assassination would throw a wrench in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The militant group replaced Haniyeh with Yahya Sinwar, the hardline Hamas leader in Gaza who is one of Israel’s most wanted men. While Haniyeh, a relative moderate, lived in Qatar and was susceptible to pressure from his host country, Sinwar is believed to be deep underground in a tunnel in Gaza and is hard to reach. Hamas on Thursday denied it was having difficulty communicating with its leader Sinwar, after one of its top officials Osama Hamdan reportedly acknowledged in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday that there are “some difficulties” and delays in communicating with him. Hamas hasn’t ruled out an agreement with Israel, but said that it won’t engage in further negotiations. It instead asked mediators for a plan to implement a ceasefire proposal put forward by Biden. A Hamas source told CNN on Wednesday that the group has adopted a position of “intentional ambiguity” over whether it will attend ceasefire talks, adding that its position on a potential ceasefire is firm whether not it attends the talks. Asked why Hamas has been unclear about whether it will attend the ceasefire talks, the source said: “This ambiguity is the movement’s position, which was announced in its latest statement, is intentional and did not come by chance. It comes as a result of Netanyahu’s behavior.” Why is this round of talks so important? This latest round of ceasefire talks were the result of a major diplomatic effort by mediators Qatar, Egypt and the US to push for a last-ditch effort to end the war and free the hostages as Iran prepares to attack Israel. The urgency of the talks was highlighted by the three mediators, who issued a rare joint statement last week calling on the warring parties to return to negotiations and offered what they called a “final bridge proposal” to overcome the remaining sticking points. The details of that proposal have not been made public.

Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images In parallel, US and Middle East diplomats have been mobilizing to dissuade Iran from launching an attack on Israel that could lead to a wider regional war. Both Iran and the US have said that that lines of communication between them are open through intermediaries. There have been some indications that Iran may abandon plans to attack Israel if a ceasefire deal is reached. But the country’s mission to the United Nations said on Saturday that Tehran’s retaliation is “totally unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire.” As of Tuesday afternoon, US officials didn’t believe that Iran has decided on a course of retaliatory action against Israel, according to two US administration officials. Furious diplomatic backchannel efforts are ongoing to try to deter a wide-scale attack and de-escalate the volatile situation, one of those officials said.

The conversation between Al Thani and Kani was “positive,” a diplomat familiar with the call said. Biden acknowledged the challenges facing a ceasefire deal Tuesday, telling reporters traveling with him to New Orleans he’s “concerned” about negotiations between the two parties amid the looming threat of an attack on Israel from Iran. The president rebuffed questions on what he’s doing to pressure Israel and Hamas to come to the bargaining table for proposed ceasefire deal talks Thursday, telling reporters, “If I told you what pressure tha﻿t I’m putting on it, it wouldn’t be very much pressure would it?” The regional diplomat who spoke to CNN said there is concern that Iran may not hold back on striking Israel, as the diplomat believes the Biden administration is not applying enough pressure on Netanyahu to reach an agreement. The lack of clarity on whether the Israeli prime minister will adhere to Biden’s May proposal, the source added, suggests time is running out to strike a deal before an Iranian attack. Qatar and Egypt, the source said, may not have enough influence to push Hamas to compromise. This story has been updated.

The ministry said 40 people had died in Gaza during the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths since October 7 to 40,005 – about one in every 55 people in the enclave. More than 92,401 have been injured. The health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its figures but says most of the dead are women and children. Israel said last month that it had killed more than 17,000 combatants in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers.

Ali Jadallah/Anadolu/Getty Images In addition, at least another 10,000 people are missing and believed to be buried under rubble in Gaza, the Gaza government’s media office said earlier this week. The soaring figures give a window into the daily suffering , malnutrition and volatility in Gaza after 10 months of conflict. United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has described it as “a very grim milestone at the world’s watch,” on X, adding that it is “a direct result of a collective failure to reach a ceasefire.” And the milestone has been passed at a particularly unpredictable point in the conflict. A new round of ceasefire talks are due to begin Thursday, after the killings of senior figures in Hamas and the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah upended the leadership of both organizations and made the negotiations appear precarious. The news follows an especially deadly weekend for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. At least 93 people were killed overnight into Saturday when an Israeli strike hit a school and mosque in the eastern part of Gaza City where displaced people were sheltering, according to local officials. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed to CNN that it hit the compound, saying its air force “precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control center embedded” in the building. Israeli military officials have said they try to minimize harm to civilians in Gaza and that Hamas bears the blame for using civilians as “human shields.” People check the damage inside a school used as a temporary shelter for displaced Palestinians in Gaza City, following an Israeli strike on August 10. Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed to CNN that it hit the compound and said that “at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated” in the strike. It later said it had identified 12 more militants who were killed in the strike. The strike was almost universally condemned, including by some of Israel’s closest allies. Thursday marks “a grim milestone for the world,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said after the figures were announced. “Most of the dead are women and children. This unimaginable situation is overwhelmingly due to recurring failures by the Israeli Defense Forces to comply with the rules of war.” Fading hopes for a ceasefire Israel launched its war against Hamas after the militant group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 100 of those hostages remain in Gaza, their families back home pleading for a breakthrough to secure their safe return. Hopes of a hostage-for-ceasefire agreement seemed to diminish in recent weeks after Israel launched a series of strikes against senior figures in Hamas and in Hezbollah, which has been sparring with Israel on a near-daily basis since October, in solidarity with Hamas. But Egyptian and Qatari mediators have conveyed to Israeli officials in recent days that Yahya Sinwar, the new head of its political bureau following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, wants a ceasefire deal, an Israeli source familiar with the matter said. Israel said it would send a delegation to the talks. Hamas, however, has said it will not participate in talks Thursday but is willing to speak to mediators afterwards if there are “developments or a serious response from Israel,” the source told CNN.

Florion Goga/Reuters A hardliner and, according to Israel, one of the masterminds behind the deadly October 7 terror attacks, Sinwar was previously believed to be dismissive of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Hamas said Sunday it has asked mediators to implement a ceasefire plan based on previous ceasefire talks such as those put forward by US President Joe Biden and the UN Security Council in July. International pressure is intensifying for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas. A drumbeat of Western criticism of Netanyahu’s actions has grown louder in recent weeks, with the election of a Labour government in the United Kingdom and the confirmation of US Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for November’s presidential election. Harris’ comments on Gaza signal a shift in tone from Biden’s steady support of Israel. US Vice President Kamala Harris meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 25. Nathan Howard/Reuters Harris said Saturday that “far too many” civilians have been killed in Gaza, saying a deal “needs to get done now.” And Netanyahu faces anger from some quarters at home. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a powerful voice in Israel, has for months repeatedly called on Israel and Hamas to finalize a hostage-and-ceasefire deal. “A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home. Time is running out. The hostages have no more to spare. A deal must be signed now!” the forum said in a statement last week . A humanitarian catastrophe A ceasefire deal would provide a reprieve for the approximately 2.2 million Palestinians who have been living in nightmarish conditions in Gaza. Nearly everyone living in Gaza has been displaced in the conflict, with many people forced to flee repeatedly as the Israeli military operation expanded, often into places it previously said had been cleared of Hamas fighters. In recent days, some 75,000 people southwest Gaza after Israeli evacuation orders were issued, according to UNRWA chief Lazzarini. Displaced Palestinians flee from Hamad City following an evacuation order by the Israeli army to leave parts of the southern area of Khan Younis, on Sunday, August 11. Abdel Kareem Hana/AP Less than a sixth of the area of Gaza is not under Israeli evacuation orders, Lazzarini said late last month. “Quite often, people have just a few hours to pack whatever they can & start all over again, mostly on foot or on a crowded donkey cart for those who can afford it,” he said Sunday on the social media platform X. So dire are conditions in Gaza that gravediggers in the enclave are struggling to find space to bury those who have died. A grave digger in Khan Younis, Najy Abu Hateb, told Reuters he is “exhausted.” “Since the war began, we haven’t stopped for even a minute, and we hope the war ends … there’s no place (to bury people),” Hateb said. Hateb said gravediggers have been forced to dig up old graves to bury the new bodies. “We have reached a situation that forced us to bury people even with sand, placing bodies on top of one another,” he added. Earlier this week Fikr Shalltoot, the Gaza Director for aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians, said the impending milestone “means that 40,000 families are grieving, and their hearts are broken.” “Many people are losing hope and some are losing faith, but mostly people are losing trust in the international community. They are angry and disappointed and believe that the world has failed them and let them down,” she said in a statement. This story has been updated.

Hashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen has been charged with four counts of threatening to use explosives and one count of destruction of an energy facility, and is being held behind bars pending a resolution in the case. According to court records, Hnaihen began smashing the windows of several businesses in the Orlando area and leaving “warning letters” threatening to “destroy or explode everything here in whole America. Especially the companies and factories that support the racist state of Israel.” Hnaihen also attacked a Florida solar panel farm, smashing panels and cutting wires, court records say. According to court documents, beginning around June 2024, Hnaihen targeted and attacked businesses in the Orlando area for their perceived support for Israel. This photo shows damage and one of the targeted businesses. US Department of Justice “The solar farm’s engineers and law enforcement investigators quickly realized that Hnaihen’s attack bore signs of premeditation and sophistication,” prosecutors wrote in a detention memo. “For example, whenever Hnaihen cut a wire, he would cut so close to the panel that it was impossible to splice in a new wire, permanently decommissioning the entire panel.” In two hours, he caused $700,000 in damages, prosecutors say. CNN has reached out to a defense lawyer for Hnaihen. Hnaihen also attempted to purchase a firearm and lied about his lack of US citizenship, prosecutors say. During a background check, however, prosecutors say the issue was discovered and Hnaihen was not able to purchase the weapon. Prosecutors warned the judge presiding over the case that Hnaihen’s alleged threats and destruction were escalating in recent weeks.

US Department of Justice “The Court should be aware that on July 9, 2024, two days before the Orange County Sheriff’s Office arrested Hnaihen, employees at an industrial propane gas depot in Orlando, Florida, discovered an identical copy of the defendant’s Warning Letter posted outside the facility,” prosecutors wrote to the judge when requesting that Hnaihen remain behind bars. “No damage was discovered at that time, but operations at the facility were significantly disrupted while a fire department hazmat team cleared the scene,” prosecutors wrote. “Final fingerprint analysis is forthcoming.”"

The city woke up the next morning to find that another Iran-supported official, Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh , had been killed in an assassination in the heart of the Iranian capital, Tehran. The chances of war, for months stowed away into the deeper crevices of this city’s psyche, had grown manifold. “Do you think I am sitting in Hezbollah’s war room?” said one exasperated political leader with ties to the powerful Beirut-based armed group. “I have no idea what’s going to happen next. You probably know more than I do.” Other officials in contact with Iran and Hezbollah said they were similarly in the dark as to how Tehran and its allied non-state fighting groups might deliver the “severe revenge” its top military officials, and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have promised. The death toll in Gaza since Israel started its war against Hamas passed 40,000 this week, just as mediators arrived in Doha to discuss a ceasefire. Abed Rahim Khatib/dpa/picture alliance/AP/File Related article High-stakes Gaza ceasefire talks resume this week. Here are the main obstacles to a deal Israel said the attack in Beirut served as a response to a rocket strike that killed 12 children in the town of Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which it blamed on Hezbollah. Hezbollah has vehemently denied the charge. In his televised addresses since then, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said a response to the attack in southern Beirut was “inevitable,” dismissing Western attempts to prevent a retaliatory strike as futile. But he was scant on the details. “God willing, our response is coming,” Nasrallah declared solemnly in one address. “We may act alone, or we may act with the axis,” he said, referring to the Iran-backed network of armed groups that span Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. The alliance of fighting groups has been referred to by some Israeli commentators as a “ring of fire” around Israel – no match for Israel’s military might but with a strategic depth that sends jitters through the country as it awaits Hezbollah and Iran’s anticipated attacks. The messaging from Iran and its powerful non-state partner seems cryptic by design. Nasrallah and his backers have touted the benefits of the “psychological war” in which Israelis brace for an attack, with little sense of when that might come and what form it might take. But there are also indications that Tehran is dragging its feet, held back by the prospect of triggering a wider war. One diplomat said he believed that Hezbollah and Iran had “trapped themselves” in their own vows of reprisals. Some have suggested that a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza may serve as an off-ramp, as the international community gears up for talks in Doha on Thursday. Iran has rejected the idea. Iranians attend the funeral procession of assassinated Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024. Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters A region kept on high alert The consequences of any reprisal are difficult to foresee. Both Iran and Hezbollah are looking to thread an extremely narrow needle, where they produce enough impact to deter future attacks on the Lebanese and Iranian capitals but stop short of igniting an all-out war. This may prove impossible. There is a widespread view that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must keep a war going in order to keep his growing domestic problems at bay. Iran, its non-state actors, and even the international community, appear powerless to stop it. “It is highly questionable whether there is any deterrence to be re-established,” said Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj.media, an online outlet covering the region. “This is going to go on, and over time this is going to be very dangerous.” It is possible that Iran and Hezbollah may have come to terms with this, recognizing that the open-endedness of their messaging around the anticipated response may be the strongest weapon at their disposal. Rockets fired from southern Lebanon are intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system in northern Israel, August 4, 2024. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images On most nights over the last two weeks, Israeli and US officials sounded alarms about an imminent response. This has not yet come to pass. It draws a striking contrast with the last time the region was on the brink of an all-out war, when Iran responded in April to an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus with a massive swarm of airborne weapons that were largely shot down by Israel and its allies. In the days that led up to that attack, diplomats and officials close to Hezbollah to whom CNN spoke in Lebanon had a rough idea about what Iran’s retaliation would look like: a show of force calibrated to cause very limited damage. Their estimates about the timeframe were largely accurate. Iran at the time was telegraphing its next move through US allies in the region. Today, there is no evidence of that happening. “There’s definitely an element of psychological warfare to this delay,” said Shabani. “But while you’re keeping the Israelis guessing, you’re also keeping the Lebanese and the Iranians on alert.” Uncharacteristically, Nasrallah conceded in his last speech that the killing of Shukr and Haniyeh must be considered “successes scored by Israel.” That sense of failure is palpable in Lebanon and in Tehran, where political tensions are on the rise and the economy has taken a hit.

Chris McGrath/Getty Images In Tehran, the Haniyeh assassination happened a day after the inauguration of Iran’s first reformist president in decades, Masoud Pezeshkian. Western analysts said Pezeshkian’s election could remedy rifts with the West. But the attack that killed Haniyeh has put a damper on those hopes. In Beirut, the summer season is normally a boon for the struggling economy. Fireworks that lit up the night sky in the days leading up to Israel’s attack in southern Beirut have given way to sonic booms produced by Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier overhead, shaking windows and keeping frightened Lebanese families at home. “I cannot think about what happens next,” said the political leader with ties to Hezbollah who CNN spoke to. “All I can do is make the appropriate preparations to help my community in case the worst happens.” CNN’s Ben Wedeman, Sarah El Sirgany, Crendon Greenway and Charbel Mallo contributed reporting."

Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Since then, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians – including more than 16,400 children – and wounded more than 92,000, the ministry reported. ‘Unrelenting’ war on children Al Qumsan is one of hundreds of thousands of survivors who have no time to mourn their loved ones against the backdrop of a 10-month Israeli offensive that has killed entire families, deepened a humanitarian crisis , and turned cities into wastelands .

Israeli media reported this week that Gallant, speaking to lawmakers in a private security briefing, had dismissed Netanyahu’s war aim of achieving “absolute victory” over Hamas as “gibberish,” branding those who say this is achievable as “heroes with war drums.” Netanyahu’s office shot back, saying Gallant’s comments jeopardize talks to release the hostages held in Gaza. “When Gallant adopts the anti-Israel narrative, he harms the chances of reaching a hostage deal,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. It said Gallant was obligated to pursue the twin goals of Israel’s war in Gaza: Eliminating Hamas and the release of the hostages seized by Hamas in the October 7 attacks. The barbed exchange is the latest in a series of spats between the two men during more than 10 months of war, and comes as Israel has been bracing for a possible attack by Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon. That has prompted the United States to bolster Israel’s defenses, sending a guided missile submarine to the region over the weekend.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to avenge the killings last month of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh , who died in an explosion in Tehran, and of Hezbollah’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr , who was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in a Beirut suburb. Iran blamed Haniyeh’s death on Israel, and a source familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Haniyeh was assassinated with an explosive device hidden in the guest house where he was staying. The death of Haniyeh, who had been a key player in ceasefire talks, threatened to derail the negotiations to halt the war in Gaza and escalate the conflict, with Iran warning that “blood vengeance” for the killing was “certain.” Hezbollah also promised that Shukr’s blood “will not have been shed in vain” and threatened to retaliate, forcing Israel to confront the prospect of a war on multiple fronts.

Mahmoud Issa/Reuters Related article Israel and US brace for Iranian attack as diplomats push hard for Gaza ceasefire Critics have accused Netanyahu of being more interested in defeating Hamas and preserving his government than returning the hostages. Far-right members of his coalition have threatened to collapse the government should a deal go through. There is growing frustration in the international community with some of these far-right ministers, as Western leaders push for a deal. On Monday, the European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell told CNN he would put forward a proposal at the EU to sanction far-right Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir. Borrell had called for sanctions against Smotrich and Ben Gvir in a post on X, days after Smotrich said it would be “moral” to starve two million Gazans until Israeli hostages are freed. “The EU has no taboo in activating its Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime against any individual involved in serious violations of Human Rights, like the Hamas operatives and extremist Israeli settlers we already sanctioned,” Borrell told CNN in a statement on Monday. “Since last October, Ministers Smotrich and Ben-Gvir statements inciting to hate and activities related to humanitarian aid clearly fall into this category,” the EU foreign policy chief added. A group of hostage families on Saturday accused the prime minister of “ gambling ” with the lives of the hostages to ensure that his government survives, according to the Times of Israel. The US, Egypt and Qatar – key mediators in talks between the warring parties – have urged Israel and Hamas to return to the negotiating table to consider a “final bridging proposal.” Discussions are set to resume Thursday in the Egyptian capital Cairo or the Qatari capital Doha. Deepening schism Gallant, who has emerged as a top interlocutor for advisers to US President Joe Biden, has often stressed the need for a ceasefire deal. He has previously called on Netanyahu to declare that Israel would not establish civilian or military control over Gaza, although the prime minister has remained vague on his plans for the “day after” the war. In his leaked comments, Gallant also claimed he had in October proposed a pre-emptive attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that Netanyahu had not supported the strike and had missed the opportunity. “The conditions today for a Lebanon war are the opposite of what they were at the beginning of the war,” Gallant reportedly told lawmakers. Responding to Gallant’s claims, Netanyahu’s office deflected blame for the failure to reach a ceasefire deal, saying Gallant “should have attacked (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar, who refuses to send a delegation to the negotiations, and who was and remains the only obstacle to the hostage deal.” In a later post on X, a chastened Gallant said he had told the private meeting that he is “determined to meet the goals of the war and to continue the fighting until Hamas is dismantled and the hostages return,” and also criticized the leaks from “sensitive and confidential forums.” Israeli soldiers walk past Palestinians fleeing the north along the Salaheddin road in the Zeitoun district on the southern outskirts of Gaza City on November 28, 2023.

In June, top military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the idea that Israel could “make Hamas vanish” is “throwing sand in the eyes of the public.” CNN recently reported that nearly half of Hamas’ military battalions in northern and central Gaza have rebuilt some of their fighting capabilities, despite Israel’s unrelenting assault, according to a joint analysis with the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project and the Institute for the Study of War."

The F-15 sale is believed to be the biggest weapons package for Israel and was announced alongside approved potential sales of medium tactical vehicles, medium-range air-to-air missiles, high-explosive mortar cartridges and tank cartridges. The notification of the State Department approval of those sales went to Congress on Tuesday, news releases from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said. Weapons sales must be approved by Congress. In most circumstances, the administration formally informs Congress of the intended arms sales after informal discussions with the heads of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees. Once the sales are formally notified, as they were on Tuesday, lawmakers have 30 days to block them. They can do that by passing a joint resolution of disapproval. Deliveries of the equipment will not begin for years. The aircraft, for example, are not expected to be delivered until 2029. Two key congressional Democrats gave their approval for the significant F-15 sale in June. CNN reported Friday that the State Department notified lawmakers it was providing $3.5 billion to Israel for the use of purchasing US weapons and military equipment. Although the weapons will not be delivered for years, the sale is nonetheless likely to provoke an outcry from critics of the Biden administration’s policies toward the war in Gaza. The US government has come under sharp scrutiny for what some say is a failure to pressure Israel on its prosecution of the war, which has killed tens of thousands in the Palestinian enclave. The announcement of the sales comes amid significantly heightened tensions in the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation against Israel after the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Israel has not commented on the killing. It also comes ahead of the expected resumption of ceasefire talks later this week, and just days after an Israeli strike on a mosque and school in Gaza killed at least 93 people . Gaza’s Ministry of Health estimates nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas. The United Nations estimates nearly 2 million people have been displaced. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant thanked Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a post on X on Tuesday for “advancing critical force buildup initiatives that assist Israel in developing and maintaining its qualitative military edge in the region.” “As we fight to defend Israel on 7 different fronts, your message of support and commitment to Israel’s security, are clear,” he said. In total, the approved sales announced Tuesday included up to 50 F-15IA multi-role fighter aircraft , and mid-life update modification kits of fighter jets and other related equipment, valued at $18.82 billion; 30 AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) and one AMRAAM guidance section for an estimated $102.5 million ; 32,739 120mm tank cartridges and other equipment for an estimated $774.1 million ; 50,000 High Explosive mortar cartridges and related equipment for an estimated $61.1 million ; and an unclear number of modified Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles 8-ton cargo trucks and related equipment for an estimated $583.1 million .

Fitch kept a negative outlook on the country’s credit, meaning it could cut the rating again in the future, as it notched down the credit rating from “A+” to “A.” The downgrade underscores the financial toll of the war, which has also seen tens of thousands of people killed and has shaken the region and the world. Analysts from Fitch said the “the conflict in Gaza could last well into 2025,” and there are risks of the conflict spreading. “The downgrade to ‘A’ reflects the impact of the continuation of the war in Gaza, heightened geopolitical risks and military operations on multiple fronts,” Fitch said in a statement. Israeli military action in Gaza has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, after Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7. At least 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel that day, and more than 250 others abducted in the Hamas-led assault, according to Israeli authorities. Responding to Fitch’s decision, Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the rating downgrade was “natural” given the war and geopolitical risks but added that the country’s economy remained strong. “Israel’s economy is strong and we are navigating it correctly and responsibly,” Smotrich said Tuesday in a post on X, adding that “the economic indicators point to the economy’s robustness and the high trust we have in the markets.” As ceasefire negotiations remain in limbo , an Israeli air strike killed at least 93 Palestinians in a school and mosque in Gaza sheltering displaced people, according to local officials over the weekend. The United States is also set to provide Israel with $3.5 billion in military aid , CNN reported. “In addition to human losses, (the conflict in Gaza) could result in significant additional military spending, destruction of infrastructure and more sustained damage to economic activity and investment, leading to a further deterioration of Israel’s credit metrics,” Fitch said.

The central government’s budget deficit is centered on military operations, mitigating economic disruptions, and also relocation expenses for the northern part of Israel as the potential for another front with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah looms in the coming weeks. ﻿Fitch also expects Israel’s debt-to-GDP to remain above 70% into 2025, whereas the median A rating ratio is 55%. Fitch said a de-escalation of the conflict and fiscal reforms that lower the debt-to-GDP ratio could help the the country get its rating back up. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Israel’s credit rating from A1 to A2, also still investment grade, in February. Moody’s said the primary driver of its decision was an “assessment that the ongoing military conflict with Hamas, its aftermath and wider consequences materially raise political risk for Israel as well as weaken its executive and legislative institutions and its fiscal strength, for the foreseeable future.” CNN’s Samantha Delouya and Irene Nasser contributed reporting.

Mediators have urged Israel and Hamas to return to the negotiating table in a renewed push to strike a ceasefire deal after the talks risked being derailed by the recent assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders which Iran and its Lebanese proxy have vowed to avenge. Negotiations are set to resume in the Egyptian capital Cairo or the Qatari capital Doha on Thursday. Last week, the United States, Egypt and Qatar – key mediators in talks between Israel and Hamas – said they will use the meeting to present a “ final bridging proposal ” and urged both sides to attend. A major Iranian attack reprisal against Israel could risk disrupting the ceasefire talks that US officials have said were at an advanced stage prior to the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. In a joint statement Sunday evening, France, Germany and the United Kingdom endorsed the calls for the warring parties to strike a deal, saying “there can be no further delay” given the simmering threat of a regional conflagration. The White House said Monday that it shares Israel’s concerns and expectations about an attack from Iran in the coming days, pointing to increased American force posture in the region as preparation for an Iranian reprisal. “It’s difficult to ascertain, at this particular time, if there is an attack by Iran and its proxies what that would look like,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. But State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a separate press briefing Monday: “We fully expect these talks to continue to move forward.” Patel would not say outright who the US believes is the biggest obstacle to achieving a deal, but said that the onus is on Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. Israel said it will send a delegation to the Thursday talks, but Hamas hasn’t confirmed its attendance, even if it has signaled that it still wants a deal. Following Haniyeh’s assassination, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain,” and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that “blood vengeance” for the killing is “certain.” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian furthered those threats on Monday, telling a Vatican official in a phone call that the assassination warrants Iran’s right to “self defense” and to “respond to an aggressor,” Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. There have been some indications that Iran may abandon plans to attack Israel if a ceasefire deal is reached. But the country’s mission to the United Nations said on Saturday that Tehran’s retaliation to Israel’s suspected killing of Haniyeh is “totally unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire,” adding that it has a right to self-defense. The US and Israel continued preparations for that scenario over the weekend. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a guided missile submarine, the USS Georgia, to the Middle East and accelerated the arrival of a carrier strike group to the region, the Pentagon said Sunday evening. The US also released $3.5 billion to Israel to spend on US weapons and military equipment, months after it was appropriated by Congress. And on Monday, the Israeli military suspended vacation flights for permanent personnel in anticipation of an attack. Iran’s UN mission said it hopes that its attack on Israel “will be timed and conducted in a manner not to the detriment of the potential ceasefire.” “Direct and intermediary official channels to exchange messages have always existed between Iran and the United States, the details of which both parties prefer to remain untold,” it added.

William Gore/US Navy/Reuters/File Meanwhile, Hezbollah – the Iran-backed militant group in southern Lebanon – fired a barrage of about 30 rockets toward northern Israel Sunday night. Although rocket fire toward Israel from Lebanon has become a near-daily occurrence since the outbreak of war in Gaza, Israeli officials fear a larger-scale response from Hezbollah after the assassination of the group’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr in a Beirut suburb last month But as the world watched Iranian airspace and the Israel-Lebanon border, the worst of the weekend’s fighting was again confined to the Gaza Strip, as an Israeli strike on a mosque and school in Gaza City killed at least 93 Palestinians on Saturday, according to local officials. With the number of Palestinians killed during 10 months of war edging closer to 40,000, Israel’s strike sparked global condemnation. Qatar and Egypt condemned the strike, calling it a violation of international law, and the US National Security Council said the White House was “deeply concerned” about reports of civilian casualties.” In the aftermath, the three mediators renewed their calls for the warring parties to agree to a ceasefire deal. Although the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters, the strike was a reminder that, despite its earlier claims to have dismantled Hamas in the north of the Strip, the militant group has reassembled in areas previously deemed clear. Palestinians pray next to the bodies of those killed in an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City on Saturday. Abed Sabah/Reuters Renewed talks After Haniyeh’s assassination, Hamas named Yahya Sinwar – its leader in Gaza and one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack on Israel – as the new head of its political bureau, suggesting that Hamas’ most extreme faction had taken over, further dimming hopes of a ceasefire deal. But, following the call from mediators last week to return to talks, Hamas requested a plan to implement the existing offer proposed by US President Joe Biden in July, rather than pursuing additional negotiations. “Out of concern and responsibility towards our people and their interests, the movement demands the mediators to present a plan to implement what they presented to the movement and agreed upon on July 2, 2024, based on Biden’s vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and to compel the occupation (Israel) to do so, instead of going for further negotiation rounds or new proposals,” Hamas said in a statement Sunday. A regional source familiar with the talks told CNN on Monday that Hamas is planning to attend the diplomatic talks. The organization’s mixed messaging comes as each side involved in the negotiations positions itself to try to take advantage and pressure opponents in the run-up to the high-stakes talks. Egyptian and Qatari mediators have told Israel that Sinwar wants a deal, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN. The source said that US officials have made clear to their Israeli counterparts that the time to strike a deal is now, in order to prevent a regional war. But, despite growing pressure at home to help bring the hostages home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stymied attempts to reach an agreement. “Nobody knows what Bibi wants,” one Israeli source said, calling Netanyahu by his nickname. Netanyahu accused his defense minister Yoav Gallant of adopting an “anti-Israel narrative” following reports in Israeli media about a closed meeting Gallant had with parliament. Gallant allegedly told lawmakers that last October he had proposed to preemptively attack Hezbollah in Lebanon, that Netanyahu had not supported the strike, and that current conditions for such a strike have now changed. He also allegedly called Netanyahu’s “absolute victory” line, a slogan regularly used by the prime minister, “nonsense”. The comments irked Netanyahu, prompting him to issue the statement criticizing the Israeli defense minister. “He should have attacked Sinwar, who refuses to send a delegation to the negotiations, and who was and remains the only obstacle to the hostage deal,” Netanyahu said in a written statement. Gallant responded to the critcism on X, saying: “I’m determined to meet the goals of the war and to continue the fighting until Hamas is dismantled and the hostages return.” Though not directly addressing his leaked comments, Gallant said leaks from “sensitive and confidential forums” was one of the “weak points that were discovered during the war” and that “we must act against it with all severity.” “We are facing challenging days in which we’ll be required to stand firm and take powerful defensive and offensive actions,” Gallant said.

Whether the Israeli prime minister wants one remains shrouded in uncertainty. Netanyahu’s allies have told journalists and other government officials that the Israeli prime minister is ready to make a deal, regardless of the impact on his governing coalition, two Israeli sources said. But the Israeli security establishment remains considerably more skeptical of Netanyahu’s willingness to strike a deal given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. Yahya Sinwar was made the political leader of Hamas. Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images/File Related article Hamas names Oct. 7 architect Yahya Sinwar new political leader. What does it mean for ceasefire talks? “Nobody knows what Bibi wants,” one Israeli source said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. What is clear is that Netanyahu is going to face a mountain of pressure this week from the United States to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal. But even as the mediators told Israel that Sinwar wants a deal, Hamas on Sunday cast doubt on its participation in the next round of ceasefire negotiations scheduled for Thursday, saying it has asked mediators to implement a ceasefire plan based on previous ceasefire talks such as those put forward by US President Joe Biden and the UN Security Council in July. “Out of concern and responsibility towards our people and their interests, the movement demands the mediators to present a plan to implement what they presented to the movement and agreed upon on July 2, 2024, based on Biden’s vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and to compel the occupation to do so, instead of going for further negotiation rounds or new proposals,” the Hamas statement reads. Hamas indicated that its latest stance was influenced by an Israeli attack Saturday on a school in Gaza that killed at least 93 people , according to local officials. US officials have made clear to their Israeli counterparts they believe the time to reach a ceasefire deal is now, in order to avoid a wider regional war, the Israeli source said. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a powerful voice in Israel, has also called on Israel and Hamas to finalize a hostage and ceasefire deal. “A deal is the only path to bring all hostages home. Time is running out. The hostages have no more to spare. A deal must be signed now!”, the forum said in a statement on Thursday. At the same time, Netanyahu’s coalition partners have made it clear they do not want Israel to strike a deal with Hamas. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called the proposed ceasefire deal a “surrender deal” on Friday. W riting on social media platform X , he said: “I call on the Prime Minister not to fall into this trap and not to agree to a shift, even the slightest, from the red lines he set just recently, and they are also very problematic.” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby rebuked Smotrich’s comments, saying “his arguments are dead wrong.” However, Netanyahu’s political future largely depends on his coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal. The Knesset (Israel’s parliament) is currently out of session for its summer recess, which would make it harder – although not impossible – for Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir to collapse the current government. And Israeli sources indicated that Netanyahu may call for elections if a ceasefire deal is reached, which would allow him to control the timing of such elections. Delegations working ‘around the clock’ Mediators are set to convene with Israeli and Hamas negotiating teams in Cairo or Doha this week. But negotiations are already underway with technical delegations working “around the clock” through key details ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Israeli source said. The talks come at an extremely tense time in the Middle East. A pair of high profile assassinations in Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks has sparked fears of retaliation that could lead to a wider conflict. Israel last month killed Fu’ad Shukr, the top military commander of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group. The next day, Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, in what is seen as a major embarrassment for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which was hosting Haniyeh.

Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and, according to Israel, one of the masterminds behind the deadly October 7 terror attack was named the new head of the group’s political bureau following Haniyeh’s assassination. Sinwar has not been seen in public since October 7 and is believed to be hiding in the tunnels trenched beneath Gaza. Haniyeh has played a key role in ceasefire talks but Sinwar’s role has been more limited, given the his difficulties in communicating with the outside world.

Rocket fire toward Israel by Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon has become a near-daily occurrence since the outbreak of war in Gaza, as fears grow over the possibility of an Iranian attack that could escalate into a wider regional conflict. The latest Hezbollah salvo was fired in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza and in retaliation for Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon, the militant group said in a statement. It comes after Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the town of Ma’aroub, southern Lebanon, injured 12 people including six children. About 30 rockets were launched from Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that some fell into open areas and no injuries were reported. Earlier Sunday, the IDF said its instructions to the public had not changed amid a possible military response from Iranian forces to the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. “The IDF and the security establishment monitor our enemies and the developments in the Middle East, with an emphasis on Iran and Hezbollah, and constantly assess the situation,” IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. “IDF forces are deployed and prepared in high readiness. If it becomes necessary to change the instructions, we will update about it in an orderly message on the official channels.” Mediators in ceasefire-hostage talks between Israel and Hamas are making a renewed push to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table this week, as concerns grow that the conflict could spiral into a regional war.

Gaza Civil Defense said people were performing dawn prayers at the Al-Tabi’in compound in the Al-Daraj neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City when it was hit overnight into Saturday. Israel confirmed it carried out the strike, saying it had targeted a Hamas command post and killed several fighters. “We recovered at least 90 people who had been killed,” Gaza Civil Defense Spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN, adding that “many of them are torn apart, many are still unidentified.” Videos seen by CNN of the aftermath of the strike show a large number of bodies strewn on the ground. Witnesses said there was no advance warning of the attack. “All of these people who were targeted were civilians, unarmed children, the elderly, men and women,” said Fares Afana, director of ambulance and emergency in northern Gaza. “These were innocent people praying … Where is the entire world?” said one man, who lost his daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren in the strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed to CNN that it hit the compound, saying its air force “precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control center embedded” in the building. The military also said that before the airstrike, “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and intelligence information.” In later statements, the IDF said “at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated” in the strike. They said “precise munitions” were used and disputed the damage being reported by Gaza officials. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari also said that a top Islamic Jihad commander – Ashraf Juda – was likely at the school that was struck, but it’s not clear whether he was hit. CNN is not able to independently verify the statements of either side in relation to the strike. Saturday’s strike is the fifth on a school in Gaza by the Israeli military since last Sunday, according to CNN’s previous reporting. Following the strike, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, said Israel was “genociding the Palestinians one neighborhood at the time, one hospital at the time, one school at the time, one refugee camp at the time, one ‘safe zone’ at the time.” People sift through the rubble inside a Gaza school struck by the IDF on August 10, 2024. Omar al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images Israeli military action in Gaza has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in the enclave – almost its entire population, according to figures from the United Nations. Israel launched the military offensive on October 7, after militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 others abducted in the Hamas-led assault, according to Israeli authorities. On Saturday, Basal said many of the dead were yet to be identified and others transferred to hospital are seriously injured. “There are still large quantities of body parts and torn bodies inside Al-Ahli hospital,” he said. “Families are having a hard time identifying their children.” One woman, known as Um Ahmed, told CNN that she could not find her husband in the aftermath of the strike. “I went to look for my husband and I didn’t see anybody, they were all in pieces,” she said. Um Ahmed told CNN the mosque was full of young people who were “all in pieces and dismembered” in the aftermath of the strike. “The bodies here are not identifiable. … They are all dismembered body parts,” said a man who came to check on the school after hearing of the strike during his morning prayer. Israel told US it used smaller munition to limit civilian harm Qatar and Egypt, who have been leading mediation efforts with the United States, condemned the strike and called it a violation of international law. The three countries have been making a fresh push to bring the warring parties to the negotiation table for a ceasefire and hostage deal. A spokesman for the US National Security Council said the White House was “deeply concerned about reports of civilian casualties” following the strike. “We are in touch with our Israeli counterparts, who have said they targeted senior Hamas officials, and we are asking for further details,” NSC spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. “We know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate out of, but we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimize civilian harm,” he went on. Savett added, “We mourn every Palestinian civilian lost in this conflict, including children, and far too many civilians continue to be killed and wounded. This underscores the urgency of a ceasefire and hostage deal, which we continue to work tirelessly to achieve.” Israeli officials have told their American counterparts they used small munitions – as opposed to larger bombs – during the airstrike in Gaza specifically to mitigate civilian harm, a US official familiar with the matter said. When asked about the strike, an Israeli military official earlier told CNN the Israel Defense Forces had used “three small and precise munitions that cannot cause the damage the Palestinians claim they have caused.” CNN also reported earlier that Israel used at least one US-manufactured precision-guided bomb during the strike, according to weapons experts. Footage of the aftermath filmed by CNN showed parts of an explosive device that Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, confirmed were from a GBU-39 small diameter bomb. According to weapons expert Chris Cobb Smith, the GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition “designed to attack strategically important point targets” while causing low collateral damage.

Qatar’s Foreign Ministry called it “a horrific massacre.” Egypt accused Israel of “deliberately killing civilians,” and said the strike was “clear evidence” that Israel does not have the political will to end the war. European leaders also expressed outrage at the strike. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said he was “appalled” by the strike in a post on X and called for an immediate ceasefire. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he was “horrified” and also called for a truce. The Palestinian Authority condemned the strike and said it also held the US responsible, calling it “part of a pattern of daily atrocities committed by Israeli occupation forces.” Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, said Saturday that “far too many” civilians have been killed. “I mean, Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas. But as I have said many, many times, they also have, I believe, an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties,” Harris said ahead of her rally Saturday evening in Las Vegas, Nevada. Harris added that, “We need to get the hostages out. We need a hostage deal, and we need a ceasefire. And I can’t stress that strongly enough, it needs to get done. The deal needs to get done. It needs to get done now.” Saturday’s attack follows similar lethal strikes by Israel over the past week. Airstrikes on multiple school buildings sheltering displaced Palestinians last weekend killed at least 47, including many children, and injured dozens more. Videos obtained by CNN from the area of last Sunday’s strike – which the IDF also claimed targeted Hamas infrastructure – show extensive destruction and dead bodies in a schoolyard. In the videos, medics and rescuers carry injured children to waiting ambulances. Palestinian officials told CNN that Israel did not give civilians any warning before the airstrikes occurred.

They’re misleading the Israeli public.” In a post Friday, Smotrich called the proposed ceasefire deal a “surrender deal,” writing on social media platform X, “I call on the Prime Minister not to fall into this trap and not to agree to a shift, even the slightest, from the red lines he set just recently, and they are also very problematic.” Smotrich’s comments followed President Joe Biden and the leaders of Qatar and Egypt releasing a joint statement Thursday calling on representatives from Israel and Hamas to resume ceasefire talks on August 15 in Doha or Cairo.

The exchange also comes amid the threat of retaliatory strikes against Israel after a pair of high profile assassinations in Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks.

Even before the joint statement, the US has been lobbying its allies in the region for peace amid fears of an escalating conflict. Biden spoke Monday with King Abdullah of Jordan and with his national security team, who outlined US military assets in the region, where they’ve been deployed in anticipation of a possible attack on Israel from Iran or Hezbollah. Biden also spoke Tuesday with Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke Friday with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi for the second time in a week, according to a State Department readout of their call, about “efforts to calm tensions in the region.” “The Secretary and Foreign Minister Safadi discussed the joint statement by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar which called for an immediate ceasefire to provide relief to both Palestinians in Gaza and the hostages and their families,” according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in the statement.

Sources told CNN it is not unusual for it to take time for money to be released from these packages. But the funding was released this week as Israel and the broader region have been bracing for an attack by Iran and/or Hezbollah following Israel’s assassinations of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and Beirut earlier this month. Israel won’t receive $3.5 billion worth of US-made weapons immediately. Instead, the funding is so Israel can procure systems that are being built now and likely won’t be delivered for several years. The supplemental funding also allocated billions of dollars’ worth of equipment that the Pentagon can draw from its own stockpiles to send directly to Israel on a much faster timeline. US diplomats and the Biden administration have also been pushing peace efforts in the region in recent weeks, amid the looming threat of retaliatory strikes against Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi for the second time in a week, according to a State Department readout of their call Friday, about “efforts to calm tensions in the region.” “The Secretary and Foreign Minister Safadi discussed the joint statement by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar which called for an immediate ceasefire to provide relief to both Palestinians in Gaza and the hostages and their families,” according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller in the statement.

But thousands remain unaccompanied,"On Tuesday morning, as Abdallah stood on a dusty street in northern Gaza amid the debris of bombed buildings, he received a call he had waited nine months for.","Aug 9, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Antoinette Radford,Middle East,"CNN — On Tuesday morning, as Abdallah stood on a dusty street in northern Gaza amid the debris of bombed buildings, he received a call he had waited nine months for. “UNICEF phoned me and said they would send them over. Please, please God,” he said wiping the tears from his eyes, in a video shared with CNN by the UN children’s agency, UNICEF. After nine months kept apart by war, his children were on their way to him. “During those nine months, each day lasted nine years,” said Abdallah, whose last name was withheld by UNICEF to protect his identity and those of his family members. Ten days after the war started, Abdallah’s pregnant wife and three children fled to the south of the Gaza Strip seeking safety. But two months ago, his wife, mother-in-law and one of his sons were killed. “I have been eagerly awaiting them. Every day I yearned to hug them, see their mother and their brother. But that was God’s will. Their mother was martyred and so was their brother. I pray God will reunite me with the rest of my children safely,” he said. When Abdallah finally held his youngest son in his arms Tuesday, it was the first time he had ever met him. Over the course of four hours at the end of June, CNN documented what life is like for children in Gaza – from stolen moments of joy, to death that comes far too soon. CNN international correspondent Jomana Karadsheh reports. Clipped From Video video Related video What four hours reveal about life for Gaza’s children “My sweetheart, this is the first time I get to see you,” he said as he kissed his now 6-month-old son, in a moment captured on video by UNICEF. CNN did not speak to Abdallah directly but was provided with his account by the UN agency. Abdallah’s children were returned to his care as a part of a reunification program run by UNICEF in Gaza, which helped seven children from four different families find their parents again on Tuesday alone. The program has been running since March, and its mission is to track down relatives of unaccompanied children who have been orphaned or become lost or separated from their family in the strip, where the burden of Israel’s war against Hamas is weighing particularly heavily on Gaza’s youngest. Of the more than 39,600 people killed by Israel since it launched its invasion into Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, more than 16,000 are children, according to the latest figures released by the Ministry of Health in Gaza on August 7. CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers. The ministry does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians. Family members are stepping up to provide care where they can despite repeated displacements. One of the children involved in Tuesday’s UNICEF mission was reunited with his grandmother, who will now take care of him after his mother, father and siblings were killed. But aid workers have told CNN that an increasing number of children – whose parents have either been killed or separated from them – are living with no support. Under-18s make up close to half of the population of the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian census figures. Israel’s repeated evacuation orders and the resultant forced displacement of populations are also causing spikes in reports of child abuse, as families are torn apart and support networks break down, according to Liz Allcock, head of protection at Medical Aid for Palestinians, an aid organization based in the United Kingdom. Displaced children gather to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in the Deir al-Balah governorate in central Gaza on August 8. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images Conflicts and war are known to exacerbate child protection issues, Allcock told CNN. “It’s not unique to Gaza,” she said. What makes Gaza different, however, is the repeated displacement of the population due to intense Israeli bombardment and frequent evacuation orders, she said. “There is largely a surge in reports (of child exploitation) during and following evacuation orders,” Allcock said, adding that this is when children are often becoming separated from their families and exposed to risks. Site visits to displacement camps in Gaza, led by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in June, documented a “significant number” of unaccompanied and separated children. OCHA’s Inter-Cluster Coordination Group – which oversees groups within OCHA working on matters like food security, protection issues and health – coordinated the visits. In one camp, community members raised concerns about an “alarming” increase in child exploitation and abuse, as well as gender-based violence, one assessment published online said. Other sites across the strip have also reported incidents of child labor and “rising concerns ” about child exploitation. It’s not known exactly how many children in Gaza are unaccompanied or separated, according to UNICEF. But using analysis of other global conflicts, the organization estimates that this population stands at around 19,000 children. That number doesn’t consider that Gaza has a high population of children, however. Nor does it consider the large proportion of extended family in Gaza that are stepping up and looking after many children whose parents are killed. UNICEF is unable to verify exact numbers due to a lack of access into Gaza. ‘It’s very common for families to get separated’ Abdallah’s experience of being reunited with his children is not the norm in war-torn Gaza. Child protection agencies face an uphill struggle to reunite unaccompanied and separated children with their families, according to Jessica Dixon, who coordinates child protection efforts in Gaza and West Bank for UNICEF. “Lots of children are being left without parental care,” she told CNN on Wednesday, on the final day of a two-week humanitarian visit to the enclave. “It’s very common for families to get separated. Crossing the checkpoints – from north to south, across Wadi Gaza – lots of people are being taken into detention. That’s been another cause of family separation.” Wadi Gaza is a strip of wetlands bisecting the enclave. Many children have lost their entire families to Israeli air strikes. Just three weeks into the conflict, Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care doctor with Medicines Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, told CNN that doctors in the strip had coined a new term: “WCNSF – wounded child, no surviving family.” Brothers Amjad, aged 2, and Ahmad, aged 7, are shown in Nasser Hospital, southern Gaza, before their medical evacuation to Egypt. CNN Related article Wounded and sick children leave besieged Gaza Strip, in first medical evacuation for weeks Some parents across the strip are also struggling to support their children – both physically and psychologically – given the limited time, space and resources they have to offer, Dr. Yasser Abu-Jamei, a psychiatrist and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, told CNN. Dixon told CNN that as a result of these intense pressures, one key concern that protection agencies have is that of neglect and abandonment of children across the strip. Faced with significant deprivation of resources, many families are barely surviving, often unable to feed themselves, Dixon said. Agencies like UNICEF are working hard to identify and support children at risk of exploitation, particularly unaccompanied and separated children, she said. But there are many operational constraints restricting their efforts and more information is needed about unaccompanied and separated children living in displacement camps, she added. “There is a huge lack of access. There is a lack of security, a lack of communications,” she said. “Phone networks are so difficult, to get hold of different people and for service providers to make contact with different families.” For now, aid organizations are doing what they can to try to reunite children with their families. On UNICEF’s recent reunification trip, the organization created identification bracelets to give to children in case they become separated from their parents – hoping to make Abdallah’s experience one shared by many others in the strip."

The leaders of the United States, Qatar and Egypt said on Thursday they may present what they called a “final bridging proposal” next week, urging Israel and Hamas to conclude a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. The three countries have been leading mediation efforts to strike a deal, and US officials claimed they were getting close before the political leader of Hamas, a principal negotiator on the deal, was killed last week in Iran in a blast widely believed to have been orchestrated by Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. On Thursday night, the mediators stepped up the pressure on Israel and Hamas to resume talks in either Cairo or Doha next week. A source familiar the discussions told CNN that a meeting is being planned for August 15 and is expected to happen, but Israel and Hamas need to confirm their attendance. “The three of us and our teams have worked tirelessly over many months to forge a framework agreement that is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude,” the three heads of state said in the statement.

On Thursday, the three mediators argued that they are “prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues.” The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed Israel will send a delegation to the talks. “Following the proposal of the United States and the mediators, Israel will send on August 15 the negotiating delegation to a place to be determined to summarize the details for the implementation of the framework agreement,” according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. CNN has reached out to Hamas officials for comment. Yahya Sinwar, a senior Hamas official and one of Israel’s most wanted individuals, has been named as the new political leader of the organization, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh, who was based in Qatar. Sinwar, reportedly hiding in a tunnel beneath Gaza, is difficult to reach and is considered a hardliner in his stance towards Israel. Warning Israel and Iran Washington has been warning both Israel and Iran against escalating the violence after 10 months of war in Gaza, in calls with Israel directly and indirect communications through allies to Tehran. “The risk of a major escalation if they do a significant retaliatory attack against Israel is extremely high,” a US official said Iran was told. Escalation would mean “a serious risk of consequences for Iran’s economy and the stability of its newly elected government if it goes down that path,” the official added. The warnings are not meant to imply that the US would carry out its own military strikes against Iran, the official said.

Just days before Haniyeh’s killing, the mediators met with Israel’s head of intelligence, Mossad director David Barnea, in Rome to receive Israel’s latest proposal. Barnea left after just a few hours following a strike attributed to Hezbollah in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights that killed a dozen people. If a meeting happens next week, it would be the first movement on talks that were feared over following Haniyeh’s assassination, and would resurrect hopes that an agreement may be reached.

But could Tehran instead be prepared to pull back in exchange for progress on Gaza peace talks? That was the hope among regional leaders gathered at an emergency summit in Jeddah. It was Wednesday and the world was on edge. Flights across Iran and its neighbors were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel’s war in Gaza. With his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran’s Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri whispered to an aide bending close to catch his words. Cameroon’s foreign minister sat to Bagheri’s right, Yemen’s to his left, along with a room full of other foreign ministers from Muslim-majority countries, all there to help prevent the situation from spiraling into a wider conflict. Since Hamas’s political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, the Islamic Republic’s leaders have vowed vengeance against Israel, whom they claim was responsible. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility. Yahya Sinwar was made the political leader of Hamas. Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images/File Related article Hamas names Oct. 7 architect Yahya Sinwar new political leader. What does it mean for ceasefire talks? The unassuming venue for such a last-ditch effort to quell Iran’s seething rage was the headquarters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC), modest by Saudi Arabia’s rapidly modernizing and glitzy standards. It sits in a dusty, nondescript corner of the Red Sea city of Jeddah. The play in the room, if it can be called that, was carefully articulated to CNN by Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, who stepped out of the high stakes talks to promote the initiative his vulnerable kingdom is championing: “The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.” The thrust, to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to soften his stance in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, isn’t new. But the payoff this time may be much more attractive than previous attempts. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US and its allies have communicated directly to both Israel and Iran that  “no one should escalate this conflict,” adding that ceasefire negotiations have entered “a final stage” and could be jeopardized by further escalation elsewhere in the region. Safadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation. Iran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its hasty threats against Israel in the immediate aftermath of Haniyeh’s killing: a Gaza ceasefire that would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians in the Palestinian enclave than it does for taking revenge would fit the bill. But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honor and deterrence are at stake. France’s President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday, retaliation against Israel “has to be abandoned”. Pezeshkian’s response suggests he is listening. “If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire,” he said. Could Hezbollah act alone Nearly ten months since Israel’s war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas brutal October 7 attack which saw around 1200 people in Israel killed and at least 250 others taken hostage, almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian health officials - and there is still no end in sight to the conflict The catch in the Gaza ceasefire escalation off-ramp play is that it is heavy on hope and short on substance. For it to work, Netanyahu will have to buy in to it too. Hamas just made this harder by replacing Haniyah with his tougher counterpart inside Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, an architect of the October 7 attacks, and anyway, right now they are in no mood for meaningful talks. The change, if it’s going to come, according to the consensus at the OIC  has to be from the outside, from the only person who remotely has the clout to temper Netanyahu – US President Joe Biden. Iranians attend the memorial procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024. Majid Asgaripour/Reuters But almost a year into the conflict, Biden refuses a showdown with Israel’s most hardline, right-wing government in its history, that also adding to the frustrations in Jeddah. Riyad Mansour, Palestine’s Permanent Observer at the UN, was in the room with Bagheri and the others. “The region does not need escalation,” he said  “What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran” What Bagheri did get in Jeddah was the kind of diplomatic support intended help get them off the ledge, with Mansour saying “With regard to what Iran wanted about, you know, the respecting its territorial integrity and its sovereignty, there was, you know, a strong support to this sentiment.” ISRAEL - AUGUST 05: An airstrike is being carried out by the Israeli army in the area in southern Lebanon, seen from Israel, on August 5, 2024.

One US official and one western intelligence official told CNN that fears are higher now about Hezbollah taking action than Iran, raising the prospect that the Lebanon-based militia group may act without them. For Netanyahu this may look like semantics intended to blunt Israel’s desire for an overwhelming response against either aggressor. He views Iran and Hezbollah as different hands of the same theological head. With the exception of direct IranianIsraeli exchange of fire in April, Hezbollah has always landed the punches on Israel Iran hesitates to take, and may this time throw a double blow, one for Shukr and one for Hamas’s Haniyeh. Were that the case Israel’s retaliation against Hezbollah could just as quickly become the regional escalation dragging in Iran that everyone fears. What is clear, the Jeddah meet and the back channel diplomacy buys diplomatic space and time to develop an off ramp that has a least a little traction for now. Both Iran and the US, to a degree, are buying in to it. Whether this fizzles out to another false horizon is with Bagheri and his president."

The coastal city of 77,000 residents sits just 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border with Lebanon, where the Israeli army and Hezbollah fighters have been exchanging fire for nearly 10 months . Unlike many other communities at the Israel-Lebanon border that have become ghost towns since October, Nahariya stands out as one of the cities that has not been depopulated as it doesn’t fall within the evacuation zone. Almost 62,000 residents of border communities have been displaced since Hezbollah and Israel started exchanging fire in October after Israel launched its war in Gaza. Forty-three Israelis have been killed and another 250 injured, according to the Israeli prime minister’s Office. Across the border in Lebanon, at least 400 people have been killed since October 8 and more than 94,000 have been displaced , according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Though life continues in Nahariya, streets are less busy than usual, locals told CNN. While pedestrians and motorists are present, the atmosphere contrasts sharply with Tel Aviv 80 miles down the coast, where bars, beaches and restaurants remain bustling. Tommy Lowenstein, 67, said the situation is “tense” in the north. “We feel it. We see it in the streets, we see less people.” Nahariya has declared a state of emergency, according to an official at the city’s municipality. Residents can hear everything from outgoing artillery fire over the border to rockets that land nearby on a daily basis, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media. The sound of rockets that fall in nearby towns and kibbutzim (agricultural communes) are regularly heard in Nahariya.

While the city’s residents have been accustomed to cross-border attacks, the conflict has escalated in recent days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah’s top military commander Fu’ad Shukr on July 30. The next day, former Palestinian prime minister and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran in an attack Iran blamed on Israel. Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied involvement. Israel has been anticipating a retaliatory attack from Iran and its regional proxies. But two sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN on Wednesday that it looks increasingly likely that Hezbollah may strike Israel independently of Iran. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Tuesday that the group will attack Israel but is keeping the country waiting as “part of the punishment.” Feels like war is ‘getting closer to us’ Liz Levy, 40, lives in Nahariya with her three children and says the war is taking a mental toll on her family. “Two days ago, I had a panic attack,” she told CNN. “Every three days, there’s a siren. It’s very scary.” Levy said she worries about bringing up her children in a climate of war, adding that her children cry whenever they hear blaring sirens warning of incoming rockets. “My daughter, she is 7 years old, and she also had a panic attack,” she said.

They (Hezbollah) are pointing at us,” Shira Jorno, 23, told CNN. “We feel it getting closer to us.” The Nahariya municipality has added more than 40 new shelters in the city since the war began and has conducted multiple training sessions to prepare medics and emergency workers for an attack, the municipal official said. Asked whether the city will have to evacuate if the conflict escalates, the official said there is nowhere to move such a large population. “Nahariya has not been evacuated as a decision that was taken together with the army because there is nowhere to go,” the official told CNN, adding that as the conflict zone expands in the north, it is difficult to keep moving people south. “Now they (Hezbollah) say Haifa (will be attacked), after Haifa it will be Tel Aviv.

Unfortunately, I received a lot of bad messages online, one said ‘Prepare for your death!’” Following the carnage of the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were murdered, security has always been tight around the team. Tensions have been heightened further by Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks and Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza . But as unsettling as the messages were, Reuveny says that he used them as fuel for his fire. “I actually think that it gave me strength,” he explained. “I didn’t read all of them, but I read some of them and it did give me some motivation. I just wanted to prove to the haters that Israel is a strong country, and those messages are not going to bring me down.” Up until this summer’s Olympics, Israel had only seen three of their athletes crowned as Olympic champions, but one of them was Reuveny’s windsurfing coach Gal Fridman – who became his nation’s first gold medalist in 2004 in Athens. Reuveny was only four years old at the time, but as he grew up, he became aware of the legend. “Windsurfing has been a really big sport in Israel because of him,” the now-24-year-old explained. “And right now, 20 years later, when we walk in the airport or in the street, people recognize him and ask for pictures. It just shows how big of an idol he is to all the people in Israel.” Reuveny celebrates after placing second in the semifinals of the men's IQFoil windsurfing event. Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images Reuveny wasn’t expected to medal in the Olympics this summer, but he says that he always believed in his own ability and Fridman’s advice might just have made all the difference. “My coach told me that a lot of people are going to lose it under pressure,” he said. “He just kept telling me to stay calm.” Reuveny’s teammate Sharon Kantor won silver in the women’s windsurfing and, with a total of six medals of the time of writing, this has been Israel’s most successful Olympics ever. Days after climbing to the top of the podium in Marseille, Reuveny is now pinching himself in the Olympic Village in Paris. “I’ve been looking up to gold medalist athletes all my life and dreaming about being like them,” he said. “No one thought I could actually win gold. It kind of sounds surreal when you call me an Olympic gold medalist, every few hours I check the medal to see if it’s real; I still have the medal and it’s not a dream. I think I made a pretty big impact to Israelis and the Jewish community all around the world.” But Reuveny’s success is a droplet of joy amid the nightmare of Israel’s war in Gaza and the rising concerns of an even bigger regional conflagration. He says that some of his classmates and friends have been killed in the last year, some at the Nova music festival in the October 7 Hamas attacks and others who are Israeli soldiers. Ahead of the interview with CNN, Reuveny asked not to discuss his brother, but he had previously told Reuters that “he’s been a combat soldier since the war began.” “It’s really sad and it’s a hard time for a lot of people in Israel and I’m not the only one who’s been affected,” Reuveny told CNN. More than once, he expressed hopes that the fighting will soon stop. On the eve of the Games, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach described all the athletes at the Games as “peace ambassadors,” and the eight Palestinians in Paris have reportedly been warmly received.

The statement comes after Israeli media obtained leaked surveillance video that allegedly showed Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman base in Israel’s Negev desert. The footage, broadcast by Israeli channel N12, appears to show a group of detainees lying on the ground at the controversial desert detention facility . A group of soldiers can be seen taking a detainee to a corner of the facility. Several Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers, who were working as guards at the base, are under investigation for the alleged “suspected substantial abuse” of a Palestinian prisoner. The IDF said last month that its Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) was formally looking into the allegations. According to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), the alleged victim – a man in his thirties – was brought to one of Israel’s public hospitals in life-threatening condition. He had injuries to his upper body and his rectum, the group told CNN. PHRI said it had raised concern about similar allegations at the base in the past, but that this incident came to light and prompted an investigation because the alleged victim was taken to a public hospital away from the detention center.

Jill Gralow/Reuters Related article Far-right lawmakers break into Israeli detention camp, protesting probe into soldiers’ alleged abuse of prisoner “When there are alleged violations, the government of Israel needs to take steps to investigate those who are alleged to have committed abuses and, if appropriate, hold them accountable,” said Miller, who called the IDF announcement of arrests of those alleged to have involved and an investigation “appropriate.” The IDF said it had no comment on either the leaked video or the State Department’s comment. A report released by the UN Human Rights Office last week said Palestinian detainees from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have faced torture, mistreatment and sexual abuse since October 7 and that least 53 have died in detention. On Wednesday, Israeli lawmakers denounced the video leak. Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for an “immediate criminal investigation” to find out who leaked the video, which he described as having “hugely damaged Israel internationally.” Widespread allegations of abuse In a CNN investigation released in May, Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described widespread abuse at Sde Teiman. The abuse included blindfolding, extreme physical restraint, and prolonged handcuffing, leading to severe injuries. The whistleblowers said that Palestinian detainees at the base were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners’ limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said. The account tallied with details of a letter authored by a doctor working at Sde Teiman published by Ha’aretz in April . Several Israeli and Palestinian rights groups, as well as local and international media outlets, also detailed alleged torture and mistreatment at the camp. Patrick Gallagher/CNN Related article Strapped down, blindfolded, held in diapers: Israeli whistleblowers detail abuse of Palestinians in shadowy detention center Responding to CNN’s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 investigation, the Israeli military said in a statement: “The IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.” “Detainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.” The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk. Earlier in July, following an international outcry over reports of abuse at the Sde Teiman detention facility, Netanyahu told Israel’s Supreme Court that he had ordered an end to long-term imprisonment at the detention center, limiting its use to initial interrogations and a temporary holding facility. The vast majority of prisoners had already been transferred out of the desert facility , according to the Israeli government’s statement to the court at the time.

The Lebanon-based militant group is moving faster than Iran in its planning and is looking to strike Israel in the coming days, one of the sources said. Iran, meanwhile, appears to still be working out how it plans to respond, multiple officials have told CNN. One US military official told CNN that Iran had made some, but not all, of the preparations that the US would expect to see in advance of a major attack on Israel. But given Lebanon’s proximity to Israel as its direct neighbor to the north, Hezbollah could act with little to no notice, the second source familiar with the intelligence said — which is not true of Iran. It is not clear how or if Iran and Hezbollah, the nation’s most powerful proxy, are coordinating on a possible attack right now, the person added, and there is a sense among some officials that the two may not be entirely aligned on how to move forward. Looming attacks would come in response to Israel last week killing the top military commander for Hezbollah, Fu’ad Shukr, in Lebanon. The next day, Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas’ political leader in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in that incident. In the days since, countries around the world are closely watching the region. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation convened an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday at the level of foreign ministers to address ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The meeting, held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, resulted in a draft final communiqué “condemning Israel’s actions” and reaffirming solidarity with the Palestinian cause. A significant highlight of the communiqué was the condemnation of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas leader and former Palestinian Prime Minister, in Tehran. The OIC held Israel responsible for this act, calling it a “heinous crime and a violation of international law and the UN Charter.” The organization warned that such actions by Israel “undermine” regional security and stability. This week, President Joe Biden and his top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have held a flurry of calls with counterparts across the Middle East. They have each had numerous exchanges with the leaders and foreign ministers of Jordan, Qatar and Egypt with a message of de-escalation.

The Palestinian militant group appointed Yahya Sinwar to lead its political bureau on Tuesday, replacing Ismail Haniyeh , who was killed in Tehran in an attack Iran blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. The move consolidates power within the organization under Sinwar, who until this week was the head of Hamas in Gaza. Sinwar, a hardened militant with many years spent in an Israeli prison, is viewed as less compromising in dealings with Israel and closer to Iran than his predecessor. He is accused by Israel of being the mastermind of the October 7 attack and believed to be hiding in a tunnel in Gaza. “I’m surprised about this move,” said Hatem Mohammed, 47, a Gaza-based retired civil servant for the Palestinian Authority that is run by Fatah, a rival party to Hamas. “It’s a hasty, irrational and reactionary move in response to Haniyeh’s assassination. They (Hamas) know internally that he’s not fit for the job. He’s an emotive and hasty person.” Yahya Sinwar attends a parade in Gaza City on May 30, 2021. Ashraf Amra/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Related article Who is Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader Israel has called a ‘dead man walking’ The situation in Gaza, he told CNN, needs a leader who “knows politics,” like “Haniyeh, (former political leader Khaled) Meshaal or (senior Hamas member) Mousa Abu Marzook.” “This appointment sends a message that the war will continue. I don’t know what they were thinking,” said Mohammed, who said he lost five members of his family in the war and suffers from infection brought about by food poisoning. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people in the enclave, according to the Palestinian authorities. Sinwar, meanwhile, is believed by US officials to be deep underground, possibly surrounded by Israeli hostages as human shields. Sinwar’s appointment has cast uncertainty on the fate ceasefire talks with Israel that would also see Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners released. He is hard to reach, is considered more hardline than Haniyeh, and is seen as being less vulnerable to pressure from Arab nations than Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar. ‘The death is all the same’ “We don’t care who they name (as leader). The names are plenty, but the death is all the same. All they’ve brought us is destruction,” said Ismail Jalal, a father of two in northern Gaza who says he struggles to find food for his sick children. “All we’re asking for is a ceasefire. Someone who will be able to reach a deal and save what is left of our people and the children that are dying daily… someone who can practice self-restraint, with no empty slogans.” Abu Fadi Rafeeq from Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, and displaced in Khan Younis, said the decision to appoint Sinwar was “reckless.” The new leader is “stubborn” and “will let the entire population die just so he can keep his word.” “He doesn’t suffer like me. He doesn’t go hungry like me. He hasn’t lost his entire family like me,” he told CNN, adding that he has lost 38 members of his family, including both his parents, his two sisters and their children, and two of his brothers’ wives.

Israel launched the war in retaliation to Hamas-led militants’ October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and more than 250 abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Despite some Gazans being disgruntled with Hamas’ choice of political leader, there are indications that support for the organization remains significant in the enclave. Polling in Gaza faces multiple challenges, including population displacement, people’s reluctance to criticize Hamas publicly and the risks to personal safety in war time. But one survey conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research between May 26 and June 1 in the West Bank and Gaza showed that only 8% of Gazans blame Hamas for their suffering , with two-thirds blaming Israel. Of Gazan respondents, 46% supported Hamas returning to power in the enclave after the war. Satisfaction with Hamas’ performance stood at 64% and Sinwar’s at 50%. “He’s the best choice to lead the next phase,” said Abu Ali, an injured Gazan who said he was a Hamas fighter. “He’s the only one who has lived this ordeal.” CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati contributed to this report."

What does it mean for ceasefire talks?,Israel has accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7. He is believed to be a key target in the siege of Gaza.,"Aug 7, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Kareem Khadder,Middle East,"CNN — Hamas has named Yahya Sinwar – its leader in Gaza and one of the planners of the October 7 terror attack on Israel – as the new head of its political bureau , following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh last week. Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ attack – though experts say he is likely one of several – making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza. He has remained at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, US officials believe. Sinwar has not been seen in public since October 7. The move consolidates Hamas under Sinwar, one of the group’s most powerful figures. Sinwar is seen as a hardliner and his appointment casts further uncertainty over truce talks already rattled by Haniyeh’s assassination. In a statement Tuesday, the group announced “the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as head of the movement’s political bureau, succeeding the martyred leader Ismail Haniyeh, may God have mercy on him.” Sinwar’s predecessor Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, raising fears that Israel’s conflict with Hamas and its allies could develop into a multi-front, fully-fledged war in the Middle East. While the Iranian government and Hamas say that Israel carried out the assassination, Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. In response to Sinwar’s selection, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told the Saudi network Al Arabiya, “There’s only one place we are designating for Yahya Sinwar, and that’s right next to Mohammed Deif and all the other terrorists who are responsible for October 7 [attacks]. It’s the only place we are preparing and designating for him.” Israel said last week that Hamas’ military chief Deif, was killed in a strike it carried out in southern Gaza last month – a report Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied. Two of Hamas’ principal allies – Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – have welcomed Sinwar’s new role.  Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, said the choice of Sinwar “confirms that the objectives sought by the enemy through the assassinations of leaders and officials have failed to achieve their goals.” ‘Not good news regarding the deal’ The move raised immediate questions on the next steps for ceasefire and hostage negotiations with Israel. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, told CNN late Tuesday that the selection of Sinwar to replace Haniyeh means, “you [Israel] chose to assassinate those who negotiate, and we chose those who can oblige you to sign the agreement,” he said. And one man who spent many years in Israeli prisons with Sinwar, Esmat Mansour, told CNN that his new role spells trouble for any future deal. “As far as Israel is concerned, this is not good news regarding the deal, because it has considered the military wing and Sinwar to be the hardliners,” he said. “It’s Sinwar who holds the captives. Now all decisions are within his authority, the military as well as the political decisions, and the decision [whether to hold] negotiations.” He added that Sinwar’s close relationship with Iran could mean other negotiating parties, like Qatar and Turkey, which have good relations with the United States, “lose their ability to influence the deal, or at least weaken their ability to influence.” Ismael Haniyeh, Palestinian leader of the militant group Hamas, arrives to participate in the swearing in ceremony for the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, at the parliament in Tehran on July 30, 2024.

He was elected to Hamas ’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo’s de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). He has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and was sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France. CNN video Related video See how data analyses contradicts Netanyahu’s claim about war in Gaza Mansour told CNN that “Sinwar is a unifying name, there is consensus on that name internally for Hamas…They need a unified movement. Symbolically and politically Sinwar unifies the movement.” Mansour said that other candidates who might have been in the frame would have run into opposition from Hamas’ international allies. “Sinwar has returned the decision-making to Gaza, and in this way they get rid of pressure from the host countries.” At the same time “because he’s on the run, it means that the leadership will be collective,” meaning that other Hamas figures would have leading roles, Mansour said. Some analysts say that Sinwar’s elevation now blurs or even extinguishes the distinction between Hamas’ political and military wings. Devorah Margolin of the Washington Institute, who studies Hamas, posted on X that: “Prior to Oct 7, Hamas long tried to differentiate between its political and military wings. Today’s decision to announce Yahya Sinwar – [who] masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks – as the new politburo chief ends all misconceptions surrounding the group’s structure.” Abu Hein said that Sinwar’s appointment as Hamas’ political leader “signifies, firstly, that the Palestinian cause is in a very dangerous stage, especially with the ongoing war on Gaza. Secondly, it shows that Hamas is a crucial player in the Palestinian arena on the international level.” This story has been updated with additional information."

It’s his (Hamas’) money, it’s his fuel, it’s his civilian control of the Gaza Strip. It just doesn’t work,” he said. Israel has control over aid that enters Gaza and aid groups are in charge of distributing it. While there have been some anecdotal reports from Gazans of Hamas stealing aid, it’s unclear how rampant it is. US Special Envoy David Satterfield said in February that no Israeli official had presented him or the Biden administration with “ specific evidence of diversion or theft of assistance.” Israel is facing mounting criticism from aid groups and international organizations for restricting food aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. A United Nations statement, citing independent experts, indicated last month that famine has spread across the entire enclave. The experts accused Israel of conducting an “intentional and targeted starvation campaign,” which they termed a “form of genocidal violence.” exp Catriona Murdoch gaza man-made famine intv 011203ASEG2 cnni world_00002001.png video Related video How experts believe starvation is being applied in Gaza The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of “starvation as a weapon of war,” among other allegations. Netanyahu has strongly denied the allegations, saying they are based on a “ pack of lies .” He has said that if Palestinians in Gaza aren’t getting enough food, “it’s not because Israel is blocking it, it’s because Hamas is stealing it .” Israel has stated that it will not end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. The conflict began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The war has resulted in the deaths of more than 39,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. Smotrich on Monday advocated for Israeli control of the aid effort “as a part or as an essential means of realizing the defined goals of the war,” and said only minimal aid is needed in Gaza in the months and years to come. “No one talks about (Israeli) military rule (of Gaza) now. No need to unclog sewers, no need for education, no need for welfare. Gaza in the next two years is (going to be) a war zone. You need food, some medicine and a minimum of sanitation – water, sewage.

UNRWA has 14,000 staff members in Gaza. The investigation was launched in January after Israel accused some UNRWA employees of participating in the attack that left 1,200 people in Israel dead. UN investigators were not able to speak with the accused, though some accused responded to written questions. Christiane Amanpour speaks to former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who led an independent review of the neutrality of the UN relief agency in Gaza. Clipped From Video video Related video Head of an independent review into UNRWA shares her findings Some on the nine were fired in January, when Israel made its allegations. Others were fired after new assertions were made this spring, Juliette Touma, communications director for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), told CNN. The UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigated a total of 19 employees who were accused by Israel of participation in the attack. “The evidence obtained by OIOS indicated that the UNRWA staff members may have been involved in the armed attacks of 7 October 2023,” OIOS said in a statement. In nine other cases, OIOS said that the evidence was “insufficient” for the employees to be fired, but that “appropriate measures will be taken in due course.” In the final case, “no evidence was obtained by OIOS to support the allegations of the staff member’s involvement.” In a statement on X , a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Nadav Shoshani, said: “9 of your employees might have participated in the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.” “Your ‘relief’ agency has officially stooped to a new level of low, and it is time that the world sees your true face.” UNRWA was founded by the UN a year after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, which marked the creation of Israel and the displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homes in an event known by Palestinians as the Nakba (catastrophe). The agency provides a wide range of aid and services to Palestinian refugees and their descendants. It is a major source of employment for the refugees, who make up most of its more than 30,000 employees across the Middle East, and has representative offices in New York, Geneva and Brussels. In a statement on Monday, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said that his agency’s “priority is to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine Refugees in Gaza and across the region, especially in the face of the ongoing war, the instability and risk of regional escalation.” “UNRWA is committed to continue upholding the fundamental principles and values of the United Nations, including the humanitarian principle of neutrality, and to ensuring that all its staff abide by the Agency’s policy on outside and political activities.” Cut off from vital funding The Israeli government in January accused some UNRWA staff members of involvement in the October 7 attacks. The Israeli government did not make their evidence public, nor – according to UNRWA – did they share it with UNRWA. Nonetheless, UNWRA in January said that it had terminated the accused employees’ contracts. The head of the IDF’s Israel Defense Forces’ Military Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, met with senior US officials in January to share his country’s intelligence on the accused. “We gave them specific names and which organizations they are affiliated with, whether Hamas or PIJ or others, and what exactly they did on October 7th. We showed them that we had solid intelligence from difference sources,” an Israeli official told CNN at the time. Following an Israeli strike inside Rafah that took the lives of at least 45 Palestinians on Sunday, Isa Soares speaks with Sam Rose, Director of Planning for UNRWA, about what he calls a ""massacre of civilians"" and the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the ground. Clipped From Video video Related video UNRWA on Rafah strike: ‘Gaza has become hell on Earth’ Israel in February released some details about 12 employees whom it accused, including their names, photos and alleged roles with Hamas. The additional details also included screengrabs of what Israel said were two UNWRA employees – a social worker and math teacher – in Israel on October 7. The defense ministry also provided ID photos of 10 other alleged Hamas members, their positions and alleged involvement in the deadly incursion, but did not provide any supporting evidence to back up their claims. CNN could not independently verify the identity of the men or Israel’s allegations about their involvement with Hamas. The allegations led to several UNRWA’s most important donor countries to withdraw funding from the agency. Most of those countries have reinstated their funding. The United States – historically, UNRWA’s largest donor – has not. Israel accused further employees of involvement in March and April. OIOS investigators met with Israeli officials as part of their investigation and review their intelligence. They also reviewed UNRWA employees’ communications and media reports. “Because of safety concerns,” they did not meet with the accused UNRWA staff or corroborating witnesses. “In some cases, however, OIOS was able to request and secure videorecorded statements from the subjects who responded to a series of set questions addressing the allegations of their involvement in the armed attacks of 7 October 2023,” the UN said in a statement."

Multiple US officials across the region and in Washington told CNN that the US expects Iran to retaliate in the coming days – perhaps even within the next 24 hours – against Israel for Ismail Haniyeh’s killing . But the US has struggled to gauge when the response will come and what form it will take, in part because Iran already moved some of the military assets necessary to carry out a major attack on Israel in April, making it more difficult for US intelligence to predict its actions now, according to two US officials. Officials are relying on multiple streams of intelligence, and there are divisions among national security officials on how and when Iran’s response might unfold. The relative uncertainty has left the Biden administration in a defensive crouch as it tries to rally allies and pressure Iran not to escalate tensions. The killing of Haniyeh – who served as a top Hamas political figure whose job included a role as one of the group’s chief hostage and ceasefire negotiators – along with the killing of Hezbollah leader Fu’ad Shukr in Lebanon last week have thrown the war into its most uncertain phase . While the bulk of the war has been fought between Israel and Iran’s proxies – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – Haniyeh’s assassination on Iranian soil and Iran’s vows of retaliation threaten to throw the conflict into a regional war that could draw in the United States. People await their flights at the Beirut International Airport departure hall on August 5, 2024. Urgent calls grew for foreign nationals to leave Lebanon, which would be on the front line of a regional war, as Iran and its allies readied their response to high-profile killings blamed on Israel.

The extent of the United States’ further involvement in the war largely depends on how exactly Iran responds to Haniyeh’s death. In preparation for possible Iranian retaliation, two US destroyers moved from the Gulf of Oman to the Red Sea in recent days, according to a US official – putting both ships closer to Israel. The destroyers, the USS Laboon and the USS Cole, are part of a number of assets US Central Command has placed strategically across the region amid fears that Iran could soon launch a major attack on Israel for the second time this year. US destroyers helped shoot down ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran at Israel in April. Biden spoke with the Jordanian king Monday morning, where both leaders discussed efforts to “de-escalate regional tensions,” according to a White House readout. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also met with the administration’s national security team later Monday afternoon in the White House Situation Room, where they “focused on the threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and to U.S. servicemembers,” according to a readout of the meeting. The Jordanian king emphasized the need for de-escalation in the region while also warning of extremist settler violence against Palestinians. The US has been asking countries that have diplomatic relations withIran to urge the country not to escalate the conflict, a State Department spokesman said Monday. “We have been sending consistent messages through our diplomatic engagements encouraging people to communicate to the government of Iran that escalation is not in their interest and that we will defend Israel from attacks, and that escalation does not serve Iran’s interest, just as it doesn’t serve the interests of anyone in the region,” the spokesman, Matthew Miller, said. Miller declined to give a timeframe of when the US expects Iran to retaliate. But he added: “We don’t think this attack should happen, and we are working to try to prevent it from happening.” In April, Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles toward Israel in retaliation for the killing of some of its officials at what it considered a diplomatic compound in Syria, the first time Iran had taken direct action against Israel in decades. But that time, officials said, Tehran telegraphed its intent, and the US was able to see the movement of weapons systems and other equipment into place — a key marker that US intelligence officials often use to judge when and what kind of military action an adversary is planning. That intelligence was part of how US Central Command was able to form a defensive alliance and coordinate a strategy that ultimately led to the successful shoot-down of almost all of the projectiles Iran fired that night. This time, according to officials who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, the American intelligence picture is much murkier. The Biden administration is racing the clock to try to keep the situation from spiraling into all-out war — even as officials have privately expressed skepticism that it will be possible to constrain Iran.

Sign up here. Beirut, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem CNN — Middle Eastern nations are bracing for the potential widening of the Israel-Hamas war amid threats by Iran to avenge the killing of Hamas’ political leader in Tehran last week. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of the head of Hamas’ political bureau Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. The country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has warned that “blood vengeance” for the killing is “certain.” Both Tehran and Hamas blame Israel for the killing but Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied involvement. Hundreds of Lebanese prepared to flee the country as nations called on their citizens to leave Lebanon. The US embassy in Beirut on Saturday encouraged citizens who wish to depart “to book any ticket” as several airlines suspended or canceled flights to the country. In Israel, the government evaluated its preparedness and options should Iran and its regional proxies attack, while citizens stocked up on supplies in anticipation of an Iranian assault. This week’s events could determine the course of the war in Gaza and significantly shift the focus away from the besieged enclave if retaliation by Iran escalates into a wider regional conflict involving the United States and other nations. Such escalation could also jeopardize efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and release hostages, despite recent progress in negotiations. CNN video Related video Ret. US general predicts how Iran could escalate attacks against Israel Iran and Israel exchanged direct fire for the first time in April after a decades-long shadow war during which the two sides avoided striking each other’s territory. Iran launched 300 projectiles at Israel on April 13, accusing it of attacking its diplomatic building in Syria earlier that month. Israel responded with a limited strike on Iran . While the unprecedented exchange was contained at the time, another round of fighting may be harder to keep from escalating. The US has boosted its preparedness to defend Israel in case of another Iranian attack. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed comprehensive security strategies to protect Israel, according to a statement on Monday. The discussions included detailed scenarios outlining both defensive and offensive capabilities. And Michael Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, is in the Middle East, according to a US defense official, who would not say what country Kurilla was in or whatever other countries he would be visiting. In a last-ditch effort at diplomacy, regional countries have reached out to Iran to try to calm tensions. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi flew to Tehran on Sunday, a rare trip for a top official from the US-allied monarchy. Separately, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatti called Iran’s Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani to discuss the “unprecedented and very dangerous” regional escalation, according to the Egyptian foreign ministry. ‘A major mistake’ But Iranian officials are not relenting. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told Safadi that Haniyeh’s assassination was a “major mistake by the Zionist regime (Israel) that will not go unanswered,” according to Iranian state TV. In a weekly news conference in Tehran, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday that the country is determined to deter Israel and that “no one should doubt” its resolve in doing so. Israel could also face an attack from its northern front. Israel assassinated Fu’ad Shukr, a high-ranking Hezbollah commander, last week in response to the killing of 12 children with a rocket on the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Shukr’s killing “crossed red lines” and will be met with an “inevitable” response, hinting at coordination with other regional groups. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran “and its minions” on Sunday that his country was determined to “stand against them on every front and in every arena –  far and near.” “Anyone who harms us will pay a very heavy price,” Netanyahu said during a speech in Jerusalem. He reiterated his assertion that increasing military pressure on Hamas was the only way to achieve the goals of the war in Gaza and bring the hostages home. Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri (L) meets with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi (R) in Tehran on Sunday. AFP/Getty Images Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for failure to reach a deal. Anti-government rallies took place in several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding a deal to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza despite regional security threats. Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu said he instructed an Israeli delegation to leave for Cairo on Saturday to continue negotiations for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. He said Israel had an “ironclad commitment” to return all hostages, adding that he’s “ready to go a long way” to win the release of all hostages while maintaining Israel’s security. Israel was considering its options to prepare for a regional attack over the weekend. The government “is reviewing possible actions that would exact a price in the case of attempts by Iran and its proxies to attack Israel,” the Israeli defense ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Gallant said Israel was “prepared very strongly in defense - on land and in the air and we are ready to move quickly to attack or to react,” insisting on the importance of readiness for a quick transition from defense to attack. On Thursday, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that while the country had “very good defense systems” and international partners who have reinforced their deployment in the region, Israel’s defenses were “not hermetically sealed.” Business as usual in Beirut Meanwhile, residents of both Israel and Lebanon are preparing for a wider conflict. Major airlines suspended flights to both countries, leaving some Israeli travelers stranded abroad, and residents of Lebanon scrambled to get on flights out of the country. The US embassy in Beirut said that some commercial options out of the country remained available despite several airlines suspending or canceling flights, and other flights selling out. In the summer months, Lebanon is usually packed with visitors from abroad, mainly from the Lebanese diaspora, giving the country a much-needed economic boost. Many such travelers are considering cutting their vacations short and taking the first flight back home. But even as the specter of war looms over the country, many are operating normally. Along Beirut’s seafront on Sunday, Arabic pop music blared through speakers as groups of men, beers in hand, sunbathed. Behind them, younger men practiced their diving skills in the Mediterranean Sea as children in floaties swam in the rocky sea. Samer Othman, 51, said he doesn’t think the region is on the brink of an expanded war. “If we were to have war, it would have happened 10 months ago,” he said, referring to October, when Hezbollah launched cross border attacks on Israel after Israel launched a devastating assault on Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7 attack during which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. This picture taken from northern Israel near the border with Lebanon shows smoke billowing during Israeli bombardment above the Lebanese Wazzani area on Monday. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Walking shirtless on the corniche with his elderly father, Othman said a lifetime under multiple wars had strengthened him and his countrymen. “The country is used to problems and shocks. We can’t live in fear. Fear can only prevent you from living but it won’t prevent death.” Others, however, were more jittery about the situation. A family was posing for pictures by the rooftop pool of a luxury Beirut hotel when two sonic booms sent them running for cover. They returned to the pool without the children when it turned out there was no airstrike. Israeli jets violating Lebanese airspace often break the sound barrier. The country braces for war in its own way and tends to pick up after itself. Hours after Hezbollah supporters held a funeral procession for Shukr, the Hezbollah commander, Beirut’s skyline was lit with colorful fireworks coinciding with a concert on the other side of town. On Sunday, thousands marched to Beirut port to mark four years since an explosion ripped through the city, killing more than 200 people. To this day, no one has been brought to justice. And with the prospect of war on the horizon, many say they don’t have confidence in their leaders or a choice in what comes next. “This is not a leadership. It’s an existence-ship (sic). This is a situation that we have to live with unfortunately,” Liz Nicholas, 31, said, lowering the placard she’s holding at the march. “They don’t represent me. I don’t think of them as my government or my leadership. They just exist. And for some reason we have to be ok with it or live outside the country like most of us are doing.” Israelis stock up on essentials In Israel, supermarkets reported a spike in shopping for basic goods on Friday. The Victory supermarket chain told CNN that sales of some goods were up 30% compared to regular sales, adding that people bought canned food, cereals, pasta, toilet paper, frozen meat, bottled water and hygiene wipes. The Jerusalem municipality last week issued instructions on what to do in the event that the city comes under attack, distributing a file with a list of parking lots that will be used as shelters, and a list of bomb shelters. It said residents must be able to reach bomb shelters in 90 seconds. “Residents are advised to clean and prepare their bomb shelters in advance,” the file said. Residents were advised to stock enough water and food for three days and to buy batteries and flashlights in addition to medications. Several Israeli agencies and services have stepped up readiness. The emergency services Magen David Adom (MDA) said it was prepared for every scenario after a three-day exercise “aimed at preparing for a potential war in the north and blackout scenarios. The exercise involved handling casualty events and “teams practiced a ‘blackout scenario’ with a focus on using satellite communication tools.” Despite the preparations, many Israelis are continuing with their daily business. In Tel Aviv’s Dizengoff Circus square, Rony Be’er, 75, walked with his friend, Ivana Reiser, 73, on Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the state memorial for Zeev Jabotinsky, Zionist leader and founder of the Israeli right-wing ideology, at Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem, on Sunday. Naama Grynbaum/Pool/AFP/Getty Images “They could hit us any minute now,” Be’er said. Asked what they are doing to prepare for a potential attack, he said: “We don’t do anything. We just walk.” Baer and Reiser say that, like many Israelis, they have ready-made shelters at home used  in other conflicts. Many of Israeli apartment buildings have built-in “safe rooms,” reinforced with concrete as thick as two feet, as well as heavy steel doors. All Israeli buildings erected after 1993 are required to have bomb shelters . Cinemas, libraries and malls are also equipped with bomb shelters. Some remain closed but open automatically when sirens go off. Theater students Roy Dror, 23, and Ron Heckmann, 26, say they’re not doing much to prepare for an attack, but know exactly where the shelters are should the sirens sound. Dror was meant to take a flight to London on Tuesday, but it was cancelled. “So we’re a bit terrified I guess,” he told CNN. “We’re very scared in a way, but life in Tel Aviv and in Israel (is) quite regular.” Heckmann, who grew up in the northern Israeli town of Nahariyah on the border with Lebanon, said he and his family “used to suffer a lot of bombs.” Compared to the north, he said, Tel Aviv feels safe. At MDA, Israel’s main emergency services organization, staff are on high alert. The decades-old establishment has expanded its ambulance fleet since October 7, operating some 1,500 ambulances. The organization has also stocked the country with medical kits and blood bags, spreading them across the state should medics struggle with obstructed roads or network blackouts, MDA chief of staff Uri Shacham told CNN at the organization’s headquarters in Tel Aviv. A non-governmental body, MDA is in close contact with the Israeli military, Shacham said, adding that while it is unclear when an attack might take place. “We are prepared for it to happen in the next five minutes,” he said.

Jamaal Bowman in New York, a big-spending pro-Israel super PAC is hoping to help defeat another member of the “squad” – Missouri’s Cori Bush.","Aug 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Gregory Krieg,Middle East,"CNN — Six weeks after leading the charge to oust Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a New York primary, a big-spending pro-Israel super PAC is hoping to help defeat another member of the House “squad” of progressive Democrats – Missouri Rep. Cori Bush. Already a top target for centrist and Israel-aligned groups, Bush broke ranks with her party’s leadership to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza last year and has been fiercely critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinian civilians. Bush has drawn three challengers as she seeks a third term representing Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, the most prominent of whom is Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney of St. Louis County. The spending in the race has not matched the campaign against Bowman – the most expensive House primary in US history. Nevertheless, the figures – for a safe blue district and one of 435 House seats – are remarkable. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s super PAC, United Democracy Project, has spent nearly $9 million on ads attacking Bush or boosting Bell. Though Bell has been more supportive of Israel’s actions, his campaign has not focused on the issue, and voters in the majority-minority, urban district in the St. Louis area are not clashing over it with the passion seen in in more typically progressive enclaves. Taking a page from Democrat George Latimer, who defeated Bowman in New York in June, Bell’s campaign has been more vibes-based – criticizing Bush for being too ideologically-driven, not being responsive enough to her constituents and – perhaps most potently – voting against President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Ted Shaffrey/AP Related article George Latimer defeats House ‘squad’ member Jamaal Bowman in historic New York Democratic primary “She sold out our president, and she sold out the city of St. Louis,” a person says in a United Democracy Project ad . That vote, like Bowman’s, was lodged in protest of certain aspects of the infrastructure legislation. (The measure, however, had enough support to be passed without their votes.) An ad from the Mainstream Democrats PAC attacked Bush for being the subject of a federal investigation over alleged misuse of campaign funds for security services. Bush has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that she complied with House rules. Bush’s message during the campaign has been simpler and, in many ways, mimics Bowman’s efforts to cast the race as a battle between big money and the grassroots “By supporting our grassroots campaign,” Bush said in a recent fundraising email, “you’re standing up against a grifter politician and the influence of big money in politics and demanding real representation for the people of MO-01.” It’s a tactic that had, before this summer, been effective for progressive House members facing well-financed challengers. Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee fended off a primary challenge for her Pittsburgh-area seat earlier in the year and other “squad” members, most notably New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, are now widely seen as invulnerable. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell speaks during an interview in Clayton, Missouri, on July 29, 2019. Jeff Roberson/AP The Bush-Bell contest, though, is deeper than it is wide. There is no policy gulf to speak of; they are mostly aligned on the broad spectrum of issues that come before House members. They both have strong ties to 2014 police killing of Michael Brown , an unarmed Black teenager, in Ferguson, which is located in Missouri’s 1st District. The outrage around Brown’s death effectively launched the Black Lives Matter movement. Bush, a pastor, became a prominent activist in those demonstrations and she parlayed that profile into twice challenge the 1st District incumbent, William Lacy Clay, in the Democratic primary, succeeding in 2020 on her second attempt. Bell, in contrast, had an earlier start in the political arena. He was elected to the Ferguson City Council in 2015. Three years later, running on a progressive platform, he unseated the controversial St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who had been in office since 1991. But like McCulloch, Bell did not charge the officer who shot Brown, irritating some supporters – including Brown’s father, who was featured last month in an ad for Bush. “I feel like he lied to us. He never brought charges against the killer,” Brown Sr. says in the spot . “He never walked the streets of Ferguson with me. He failed to reform the office.” In late October 2023, weeks after Hamas’ deadly attack inside Israel, Bell backed out of a Senate run against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley to announce that he would challenge Bush instead. At a news conference at the time, he suggested that the congresswoman’s stance on the conflict – she was among the first to call for a ceasefire – drew him to the race. “Understand this unique place that we are with the world literally on fire,” Bell said. “I think that we need to make certain that we are providing that effective leadership, not only in our district but in DC and on the world stage.” Incidentally, a few months earlier, Bell had told Bush in a phone call – first reported by KSDK in St. Louis – that he had no intention of challenging her. “Don’t even think for even a second that that’s the case,” Bell told the congresswoman. “I’m telling you, on my word, I am not running against you. That is not happening.” US Vice President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at West Allis Central High School during her first campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 23, 2024.

Bell’s campaign hasn’t disputed what was said on the phone call, instead arguing that the assurance was given ahead of the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. His campaign manager told KSDK that Bell decided to leave the Senate primary for the House race after receiving “encouragement” from “stakeholders at the local, statewide, and national level.” Since then, it’s been a familiar proxy clash between old foes. AIPAC’s United Democracy Project and another pro-Israel group, Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, have invested in Bell’s cause, along with the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC and billionaire Reid Hoffman’s Mainstream Democrats PAC. In Bush’s corner, Justice Democrats, the group that became famous for recruiting Ocasio-Cortez to first run for office, and the Working Families Party are spending to defend their left-wing ally. The relative outlays, though, are stark – Bell-backers have outspent Bush’s side by about 3-to-1 on advertising. As the incumbent, Bush does have the backing, at least on paper, from House Democratic leadership, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are also on board. Ocasio-Cortez sent out fundraising appeals for the Bush campaign. At home, St. Louis City Mayor Tishaura Jones has also endorsed her. But support for Bell is robust locally too – often a more important mark of how a low-turnout primary will pan out than any other metric. Indivisible St. Louis endorsed Bell, who also has vast support from labor. The editorial board of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is also backing the challenger. Top Washington Democrats have been fairly quiet, not-so-subtly signaling that Bell will be welcome. Many are still cross with Bush for ousting Clay four years ago, breaking his family’s grip on a seat they’d held since before man walked on the moon.

Ali Elaydi Courtesy Ali Elaydi They also desperately need skilled physicians like me. I’m an orthopedic surgeon. Earlier this year I completed my training at Yale medical school and I now work at a small practice in Texas. Like many Americans, I have been eviscerated by images in the news of people who have lost limbs in the bombing by Israel or who were subject to crude amputation because an arm or leg was rendered useless after being crushed by falling masonry. As a physician, I felt compelled to help. I was able to travel to Gaza in April, to help those wounded by Israeli bombardments that have killed and injured thousands who have become trapped in buildings, struck by shrapnel or hurt during missile strikes on refugee camps. After a rule recently imposed by Israel, however, I’m no longer allowed to lend my medical expertise to help in Gaza. The medical mission I was part of, sponsored by an aid group called ‘FAJR’ Scientific , took place at the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, a facility that has since been evacuated. I planned to join a follow-up trip in June with the same aid organization and was to be placed at a hospital in central Gaza. I got as far as Jordan when I learned that I had been denied permission to reenter by Israeli authorities. The reason, I’m told, is that I am Palestinian. Palestinians wait for medical care at the European hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip in May, before the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of the facility. AFP/Getty Images I was born in a refugee camp in Gaza four years into the first Palestinian Intifada . At that time, Israeli forces had invaded Gaza. In those warlike conditions, violence was a normal part of our day-to-day life. We applied for political asylum in the US and were lucky enough to get it. I was five years old when we left. We were among the lucky few who were able to escape using that route. We fled Gaza as refugees. Most of my extended family still lives in Gaza.

I often felt guilty knowing that the loved ones I’d left behind would not benefit from the advantages that I got in the United States. I pursued a career path that would allow me to most impactfully give back to my homeland. Medicine was a natural choice, given my interests and aptitude. In every application, in every personal statement, and in each interview, I expressed a career goal: to provide medical relief to those suffering in Gaza, to help those who couldn’t escape the ravages of war as I had. In April, my orthopedic training at Yale was coming to an end, and the war in Gaza was raging. It almost seemed predestined that the conclusion of my long traineeship corresponded with the worst violence Gaza had seen. I knew it was time to make good on my promise and travel back to Gaza, to contribute my surgical skills, and to provide any assistance I could to a severely depleted healthcare system. That two-week medical mission was a life-changing experience, as much for the volunteers as for the people we were fortunate enough to be able to help. There were 14 of us: 10 orthopedic surgeons, four anesthesiologists. We did a lot of good on that trip, but when it was time to return to the US, we were aware of how much work we still had left to do. I signed up to take part in a monthlong followup mission in June.

Courtesy Ali Elaydi I had already received the necessary approvals from the United Nations and the World Health Organization. I arrived in Jordan several days before I and the other members of the medical team were to travel to Gaza. That’s when, just a few days before we were to depart, the organizers of the trip received a text saying that the Israeli authorities had approved everyone’s entry — but not mine. The message, which was forwarded to me, said that I had been “formally rejected due to Palestinian roots.” Memories of my upbringing, my escape and my first mission to Gaza came flooding back to me, but with an intensified sense of helplessness. A tragedy, my own personal Nakba, was unfolding. I could barely make sense of the words on my phone screen, so strong was my disbelief. Palestinian children stand in a camp for displaced people in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip in April. AFP/Getty Images Related article Opinion: How the suffering in Gaza is different from other conflicts Misery and immense need of the kind I had seen in Gaza is why I went into medicine, and why I wanted to do orthopedic surgery. During that April mission, it was never far from my mind that I was one decision away from still being among the people suffering there. I was able to escape Gaza as a child but that doesn’t make my life any more valuable than the lives of people who live there. I didn’t want to be one of those people who just talked about helping those in need. My training was done. This was my calling. This is why I went into medicine. Israeli policy has made giving back impossible, however. The phone text sent to the medical charitable group that Ali Elaydi had planned to join explaining that Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT — the agency that controls the flow of aid into Gaza — denied his entry into Gaza because of his Palestinian ancestry. Courtesy Ali Elaydi The policy decision exacerbates the already dire conditions in Gaza. The region’s health crisis is not an abstract statistic but a daily reality for millions of people. Hospitals are overwhelmed , medical supplies are scarce and trained medical personnel are even harder to find. Every doctor, every nurse, every healthcare worker makes a palpable difference. I’ve borne witness to this fact. That’s why refusing to allow doctors of certain backgrounds to volunteer cannot be considered simply a bureaucratic prerogative; it is a direct denial of health and well-being to the people of Gaza.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi) Jehad Alshrafi/AP Related article Opinion: In Gaza, fear of ‘the war after the war’ Israel’s policy excluding anyone with parents or grandparents who are Palestinian from being able to take part in humanitarian missions has meant that a lot of my friends who had signed up for upcoming missions were pulled from teams because of the same policy, whether they’ve ever previously set foot in Gaza or not. I suspect that it’s just one of many tactics employed by the Israeli government to restrict the flow of aid to Gaza. On the first mission I was on, I was able to take 10 suitcases of medication with me. On the one I wasn’t allowed to take part in, we were allowed one bag and no medications other than those for personal use. The international community must stand firm in condemning such practices and advocate for the sanctity of humanitarian assistance. The denial of a Palestinian doctor’s right to volunteer — in the process hindering the delivery of humanitarian efforts — is an affront.  Governments around the world, international organizations and individuals of influence should do what they can to help reverse this inhumane policy.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/sport/palestinian-olympic-swimmer-spt-intl/index.html,"Palestinian Olympic swimmer is living a personal dream, fighting for her homeland through sport",24-year-old Palestinian Olympic swimmer Valerie Tarazi tells CNN Sport that she fights for her country and “more recognition” through sport.,"Aug 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Rosanne Roobeek,Middle East,"Paris CNN — In the heart of Paris, the 2024 Summer Olympic Games are in full swing. The Games are unique in bringing athletes together from around the globe in a celebration of sport and unity. Among them is a small but determined group of athletes chosen to represent a nation embroiled in conflict. “This has been my personal dream for the longest time,” 24-year-old Valerie Tarazi told CNN Sport . “But I’m not here for myself.” Tarazi, a swimmer who competed in the 200-meter individual medley, is one of eight Palestinians competing in Paris. Just like every athlete talented enough to make it this far, the Olympic Games marks the culmination of decades of work and investment, but for these Palestinians, the Games represent more than just a sporting achievement. “The harder I train and the better I do, the more recognition Palestine gets,” Tarazi said. “That’s our mission, I fight for my country through sport.” The eight-strong team has formed a close-knit bond, driven by a shared sense of purpose. While most athletes have been consumed with training and peaking at the right time for a career defining opportunity to capture a medal, the Palestinian team’s journey to Paris has been fraught with challenges, both logistical and emotional. “We’re here [for each other] in the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. And we’ve talked about what we want to do as a mission, as athletes,” Tarazi said. “We want to spread our stories and the message of peace.” Flag bearer Tarazi was selected alongside boxer Wasim Abu Sal to carry the Palestinian flag at the opening ceremony. “Honestly, it’s the biggest honor that I can ever have,” she explains.

(AP Photo/Martin Dokoupil) Martin Dokoupil/AP Related article Gaza war weighs heavy on the minds of Palestinian Olympians: ‘I want to be an inspiration’ “Especially at a time where Palestine’s going through a war and a lot of people don’t want us to raise the flag. A lot of people don’t want us to be here. So being able to do that, go down the Seine , honor my family and honor my country means the world,” Tarazi continued. While Palestine does not have full international recognition and is a non-member observer state at the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognized the National Olympic Committee of Palestine as a member in 1995, allowing Palestinian athletes to compete in the Games. The significance of carrying the flag at an opening ceremony in France, a country that does not officially recognize the state of Palestine, was not lost on Tarazi. “Someone actually asked me the other day if the Palestinian flag is a symbol of resistance,” she said. “And, I said, ‘Every other country in the world has a flag. Why can’t we have a flag?’ We’re people, we’re just like everyone else, we’re just athletes, we want to be here and compete.” Casualties These Olympics are taking place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed since the October 7 Hamas attacks. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, as of July, around 400 athletes, coaches and sporting officials have been killed or wounded. Among the casualties in Gaza is Palestine’s first ever Olympian and the flag bearer from the 1996 Games, Majed Abu Maraheel, who reportedly died in the Nuseirat refugee camp earlier this year due to kidney failure. Photo illustration by CNN/Getty/Reuters Related article ‘On the roadsides there were shot up cars where people had been killed’: Facing war, death and destruction ahead of Olympics Asked about Maraheel, Tarazi reflects on following in his footsteps. “He did it for a greater cause, he did it for the Palestinian people. The same way I do it, the same way Wasim, our other flag bearer did it,” she said. “I raise the flag for all of those people, the very innocent victims that had honestly just passed away because of this conflict.” The emotional toll of the situation in Gaza is a constant challenge for the team. “Why do we have to be at the Olympics getting phone calls about our relatives dying?” Tarazi questioned. Some teammates have received such devastating calls, a grim reality that has sadly become the norm: “It’s almost like – we’re not numb to it because it still impacts us, but it’s a normal thing now. And it shouldn’t be.” The reality of the situation on the ground in Gaza is rarely far from Tarazi’s mind in Paris. “I use the fire from everyone else when I am going through a hard time. I just think I could be with my family in Gaza right now, and I could be with my friends who are struggling to find clean water and my little bit of pain or suffering, or one stupid comment. You know, that doesn’t mean anything compared to what they’re going through.” Support and hope Despite the challenges, the athletes have found solace and support from Palestinians worldwide. Messages of encouragement and solidarity have poured in, reminding them of the importance of their mission. “I’ve received so much love and support from people in Gaza,” Tarazi noted. “That means the world to me, that they know I’m here to represent my family, my roots, and everything like that.” For Tarazi and her teammates, the Olympics are a rare opportunity to shine a light on the Palestinian experience and to inspire hope through sport. The fact that there is no regulation-sized pool in all of Gaza underscores the significant obstacles they face in developing athletic talent. “For the basic human right of sport to just not be a reality in Palestine, that breaks my heart,” she said. “It’s given me life skills that I can use for everything. So I know that’s definitely what we’re looking for the future: making sport a human right.” As the Palestinian team competes in Paris, Tarazi says they are not just athletes, they are ambassadors for peace, unity, and resilience. “We want to inspire the younger generation, the next generation of athletes,” Tarazi said. “We all have a common goal. We all strive to promote the Olympic Charter in peace, unity, and solidarity. And that’s so important to everyone here.” French singer Yseult performs ""My Way"" at the end of the Olympic closing ceremony as fireworks go off above the Stade de France on Sunday, August 11.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/middleeast/lebanon-travel-warning-middle-east-tensions-intl/index.html,Foreign citizens urged to leave Lebanon ‘as soon as possible’ as regional tensions spike,Countries are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible” amid heightening tensions in the region.,"Aug 5, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Saskya Vandoorne,Middle East,"CNN — Several countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and France have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as heightened tensions in the region spark fears of a widening Middle East conflict. The warnings come after the US said it was sending additional warships to the region and as Washington’s embassy in Lebanon called on citizens to book “any ticket available to them.” Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy said his message for British citizens was, “leave now.” The region is on high alert after Iran vowed revenge on Israel, which it blames for the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the capital Tehran earlier this week. Haniyeh’s death came just hours after an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr. In the latest flurry of diplomatic activity, Iran’s state news agency (IRNA) reported that the Foreign Minister of Jordan was making a rare visit to the Iranian capital Tehran on Sunday, to “meet and exchange views with Iranian officials regarding bilateral, regional and international issues.” The developments have raised concerns that Israel’s war in Gaza, which is now well into its ninth month, could spill over into a full-blown Middle Eastern conflict. It is thought that Lebanon-based Hezbollah could play a prominent part in any such retaliation. The militant group has been involved in daily exchanges of fire with Israel; overnight on Saturday Hezbollah fired 30 projectiles, most of which were intercepted by Israel. On Monday, Hezbollah claimed to have launched a drone attack that hit a military target in northern Israel, calling it retaliation for the recent assassinations and a show of support for Gaza. Israel launched multiple interceptors at “suspicious aerial targets” that crossed from Lebanon into Upper Galilee, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Two IDF personnel were injured after one target was downed and firefighters were extinguishing a blaze in the area. In a separate statement, the IDF claimed to have struck “multiple” Hezbollah targets in Lebanon overnight, including a weapons storage facility. It also said it had identified and shot down a “suspicious aerial target” that crossed from Lebanon Monday morning, and had observed a “hostile explosive UAV” that crossed from Lebanon and fell in the area of Malkia. No damage or injuries were reported from the incidents. Many countries already had travel warnings in place but have issued fresh advice in the wake of the latest developments. Smoke billows at the Israeli-Lebanon border from the site of a rocket fired from the Lebanese side, towards the Israeli village of Metullah on Saturday. AFP/Getty Images France told its citizens to make arrangements to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible” in a statement from the Ministry for Europe and Foreign affairs on Sunday. Jordan issued a similar warning to its citizens. The country was involved in shooting down Iranian drones when Iran launched unprecedented retaliatory strikes in April for a suspected Israeli attack on a diplomatic complex. Turkey meanwhile updated its travel advisory for Lebanon, urging those who do not need to stay in the country to leave while commercial flights remain active. “Our citizens should avoid traveling to Lebanon unless it is essential; Our citizens in Lebanon are advised to be cautious, not to go to Nabatiyeh, South Lebanon, Bekaa and Baalbek-Hermel provinces unless necessary, and those who do not need to stay in Lebanon are advised to leave Lebanon, if possible, while commercial flights are still continuing,” Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Öncü Keçeli posted to X on Sunday. Airlines including Air France, Lufthansa and Kuwaiti Airlines have already canceled flights to and from Lebanon while others diverted planes away from the country. Preparing for ‘every possibility’ In a further sign of the region bracing for an Iranian retaliation, the US on Saturday sent a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East. It marked perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting. White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Sunday that the US and Israel are preparing for “every possibility” after the Pentagon sent the additional military assets. “We and our ally Israel are preparing for every possibility. And that’s the vein in which the announcements made by the Pentagon took place. All of those posture adjustments are to prepare for a potential response against Israel from Iran or any other adversary,” Finer told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” And on Sunday, US State Secretary Antony Blinken spoke with the foreign ministers from G7 nations to discuss the “urgent need for de-escalation in the Middle East,” according to a State Department spokesperson. The spokesperson said Blinken and the foreign ministers discussed ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire that would secure hostage releases and the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. They also reiterated their commitment to Israel’s security and urged “maximum restraint from all parties” to keep the conflict from escalating. Israelis have been stocking up on supplies, while a file from the Jerusalem municipality advised residents to “clean and prepare their bomb shelters,” warning they must be able to reach shelters in 90 seconds.

Rescue operations continue in hopes that some people remain alive under the destroyed buildings, which had been serving as shelters for displaced families, he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency have taken responsibility for the strike, saying that they were targeting “terrorists operating inside Hamas command and control centers” that were “embedded” within the schools. The IDF did not respond to CNN’s questions regarding the number of Hamas members and civilians killed in the strike, or whether civilians were warned of the strike in advance.

The two school buildings housed hundreds of displaced people, primarily women and children, according to the local journalist. Both schools were in a densely populated residential area. Palestinian officials told CNN that Israel did not give civilians any warning before the airstrikes occurred. “If a warning had been given, the number of deaths would have been lower,” Basal said. Sunday’s strike follows a series of strikes on the Al-Huda and Al-Hamama schools — also targeting alleged Hamas infrastructure, according to the IDF — that left at least 17 dead on Saturday. In that case, Basal said, “the first bombing was unexpected and resulted in a large number of martyrs and injured individuals. While the martyrs and injured were being retrieved, the occupation forces issued a warning that another strike was imminent.” The death toll from Israeli military action in Gaza since October 7 reached 39,583 on Sunday, with a further 91,398 people injured, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

I send my condolences to the families of the murdered and best wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured.” Netanyahu praised the police officers who “eliminated the terrorist,” adding “we will reckon with everyone who cooperated with him.” Israel’s Minister for State Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site of the attack and repeated a call for Israelis to arm themselves. “I share in the grief of the families and wish a full recovery to the wounded. Our war is not only against Iran, but here in the streets. This is exactly why we armed the people of Israel. More than 150,000 licenses for weapons in the last eight months,” he said, urging people to “carry a weapon, it saves lives.” Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israelis to arm themselves following the attack. Mahmoud Illean/AP Palestinian militant groups celebrated the attack in Holon, with the Popular Resistance Committees, an umbrella organization of armed groups, and the Al-Qassam Brigades posting messages of support on their social media channels. Hamas said in a statement that it “mourns” the perpetrator of the attacks, who it described as a “martyred hero.” “Hamas views this act as a natural response to ongoing Israeli occupation crimes against the Palestinian people, including brutal acts in Gaza, escalating violations in the West Bank, and the assassination of movement leader Ismail Haniyeh,” it said. The assassination of Haniyeh , Hamas’ political leader, earlier this week further heightened tensions at an already volatile time, raising fears that Israel’s conflict with Hamas and its allies could develop into a multi-front, fully-fledged war in the Middle East. Attacks on Israeli civilians are not uncommon, though they usually take place in areas such as Jerusalem and the West Bank, where large populations of both Israelis and Palestinians live. Last July, eight people were injured after a car driver rammed into pedestrians near a Tel Aviv shopping center and then got out of the vehicle to stab civilians.

Often bustling with crowds on a weekend, the coastal city of more than 400,000 residents was quieter than usual, with some attributing the subdued mood to fears of an Iranian attack in retaliation to the assassinations carried out against Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was on “high alert,” and Israeli supermarkets are reporting a spike in shopping for basic goods as citizens stock up. On Wednesday, Netanyahu said that his country “struck crushing blows” to the “the three H’s” – Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, all Iranian-backed, all fierce Israeli foes. The prime minister was celebrating the assassination of Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif , Hezbollah military commander Fu’ad Shukr and retaliatory strikes on the Houthis in Yemen last month. Hamas also blamed Israel for the assassination of their political leader, Ismail Haniyeh , who was killed on Wednesday in Tehran. Israel has not commented on the killing. Netanyahu’s tone stands at odds with the mood on the ground in Tel Aviv, including among families of the hostages still in Gaza. Video Ad Feedback Israeli hostage relative on her ‘worst fear’ after assassination of Hamas political leader 01:31 - Source: CNN Four of Yifat Zailer’s relatives are still held in Gaza by Hamas – Zailer’s cousin Shiri and her husband Yarden, along with their two sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, who spent his first birthday in captivity in January. The Bibas boys remain the youngest of 111 hostages still held in Gaza since October 7, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. In November, Hamas released a video of Yarden Bibas blaming Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two children in an airstrike. CNN has not confirmed the deaths nor the claim of the airstrike. “I thought this would end quicker,” Zailer told CNN’s Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv, saying she is frustrated with the Israeli government because it isn’t listening to what people are saying on the streets. “I feel they (the government) don’t hear it’s enough; I feel they don’t hear the people on the streets shouting, that our priority is getting the hostages back,” Zailer said. Polls have repeatedly shown that most Israelis prioritize the release of hostages over continued war. Israeli hostage Kfir Bibas. Hostages Missing Families Forum Related article Family marks the first birthday of Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage taken into Gaza A recent survey conducted by independent research center the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) showed that 56% of Israelis support a deal to release all the hostages and end the war in Gaza. It also showed that most right-wing Israelis have a greater appetite for the war. “A large majority of those on the left and in the center consider a deal for the release of hostages to be the highest priority,” the survey said, “while the majority on the right prioritize a military operation in Rafah.” Zailer’s family was taken from Kibbutz Nir Or on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel retaliated by waging a war in Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say killed more than 39,000 people in the enclave, most of whom are women and children. The war has also displaced almost all of Gaza’s population, flattened much of the strip and triggered a humanitarian crisis. But Netanyahu has said that the war will continue until Hamas is eliminated, a goal deemed unrealistic by his critics. Hopes that a deal that would release Zailer’s family, along with the more than 100 other hostages, have ebbed and flowed throughout the past ten months of war. The spike in tensions last week only raised the worst of fears. Zailer worries she will wake up one day to find that all the hostages had been killed, she said, “because they (Hamas) decided they have nothing to gain out of them.” ‘We’re waiting for an attack’ As families worry for their loved ones in Gaza, those in Israel are bracing for a possible Iranian retaliation, a move that could plunge the Middle East into an all-out war that drags in other regional players and potentially the United States. On Tel Aviv’s main beach promenade, some Israelis are spending their Saturday swimming and surfing, knowing an Iranian attack could hit their city at any moment. “We’re waiting for an attack, that’s the general feeling now,” Itay Oved, 29, told CNN. While Israelis are used to attacks, he said, many are also tired.

Alona Lelchuk, 31, said this war feels different, however, mainly because there are hostages still in captivity. “We can’t be too proud,” she told CNN. “We need to be alert, we cannot celebrate.” Netanyahu has been accused of losing focus of one of the main purposes of the war, which was to bring back those kidnapped. Without a ceasefire deal, they are unlikely to come home. But the Israeli leader has been under pressure from far-right ministers of his coalition to delay a ceasefire deal and press on with the war in Gaza, which today shows few signs of ending. Even before the last escalation, the prime minister has been accused by critics of obstructing negotiations leading to a deal, and instead clinging to an extended war in efforts to ensure his political survival and that of his coalition. Zailer is worried that as the war drags on and the death tolls rise in Gaza, her concerns for the hostages become less and less “legitimate” in the eyes of the world, especially as Israel increasingly loses international support for its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave. She also worries for the children, Israeli and Palestinian, who will be forced to grow up with the wounds of this drawn-out war. “The children that will grow out of this war will remain with this wound and this fear and this pain,” Zailer told CNN. “On both sides.” CNN’s Eugenia Yosef and Tim Lister contributed reporting."

The demonstrations – a regular occurrence – were notable for taking place despite urgent security warnings as Israel braces for a possible strike from Iran. Some form of military retaliation has been widely expected in the region following the unclaimed assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. Despite the tense security situation, large crowds gathered to Begin Gate in Tel Aviv on Saturday to support the families of the hostages and to call for their release from captivity, according to protest organizers. Videos showed protestors waving Israeli flags and holding up signs with images of the Israeli hostages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a conference in Jerusalem, on February 18.

There are currently 115 total hostages, living and dead, being held in Gaza, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Of that number, 111 hostages were taken during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, which killed over 1,200 people. Israeli’s ensuing military offensive in the isolated Palestinian enclave has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly 2 million, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health and the United Nations. ‘Tell the public the truth’ Family members of captives held in Gaza have harshly criticized Netanyahu’s approach to the conflict, and are now demanding a public explanation for his government’s failure so far to negotiate a deal that would see the remaining Israeli hostages liberated. In a statement released Saturday, an association representing the families accused the Israeli leader of choosing “to escalate the situation instead of securing a deal that would save lives.” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also posted a statement on Telegram calling on Israel’s security chiefs to “tell the public the truth,” writing: “If the government of Israel has given up on the hostages, it needs to be honest with the families and stop playing games.” Anger and impatience over the slow pace of hostage releases from Gaza flared this week following a new report that Netanyahu clashed with top advisors on whether to accept a new hostage and ceasefire deal proposal, which the Israeli Prime Minister Office has rejected as “incorrect.” Supporters and relatives of Israelis held hostage by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip since October lift placards during a rally to demand their release in Tel Aviv on August 3, 2024. Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images Israel’s Channel 12 reported that, at a tense meeting of Israel’s security council on Wednesday night, senior officials had urged Netanyahu to take a hostage and ceasefire deal with Gaza militant group Hamas. The report claimed that Mossad director David Barnea had said “there is a deal ready and that Israel must take it,” while Ronen Bar, the head of Israeli security agency Shin Bet, said it appeared to him the prime minister did not want the outline of the deal on the table.

The description that Hamas supposedly agreed to the terms of the deal is false…” it said. Netanyahu’s office on Saturday released another statement accusing “leaks and false briefings in the media” of misleading the public, and blaming Hamas for hindering negotiations. “While Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to the deal outline, Hamas has been trying to introduce dozens of changes that, de facto, nullify the outline,” the statement said.

In a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday, Biden said the US would “support Israel’s defense against threats,” which would include “new defensive US military deployments,” according to a readout of the call. The statement did not detail what new deployments would occur ahead of an anticipated Iranian attack in response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. According to several US officials, the Pentagon has discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region, but no final decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon.  The officials said an Iranian response could occur in the coming days. The USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group, which includes the aircraft carrier, destroyers and other warships, has been operating in the Gulf of Oman in recent weeks. The strike group could potentially move into the Gulf of Aden or the Red Sea, where Navy warships have intercepted dozens of Houthi launches over the past several months. The USS Wasp amphibious assault ship and several other Navy vessels are currently operating in the Mediterranean Sea. The group includes a Marine expeditionary unit capable of carrying out an evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon if the US ordered such an evacuation. Biden said late Thursday night he is “very concerned” about escalating tensions in the Middle East. “We’re very concerned about it. I had a very direct meeting with (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) today. And – very direct. We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it, and they should move on it now,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Asked whether the assassination of Haniyah impacted the chance of a ceasefire, he said it has “not helped.” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) promised a “harsh” and “painful” response to the assassination . Israel has not commented on the killing. The Iranian response to the killing of Haniyeh may include attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria from Iranian-backed proxy militias in the region, according to the officials. For months, the militias launched scores of attacks on US forces in the Middle East, but those largely subsided after a drone attack killed three US service members in Jordan in January. Officials say Iran could instruct those groups to start firing on US forces once again. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that “international partners” have bolstered their forces in the region, though he did not specify which countries. “We have very good defense systems,” he said of Israel’s own preparations for an attack, “and in addition we have international partners who have reinforced their forces [deployed] in the region, to help us counter the threats.” A Defense Department spokesman said Thursday the Pentagon has no information to provide on the movement of US forces or changes to force condition at this time. The US is expecting the anticipated Iranian attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones launched against Israel on April 13, officials said. But this attack could be larger and more complicated than before, including the possibility of a coordinated attack with Iranian proxies from multiple directions. A coalition of countries, including Jordan and other Arab states, came together in April to share intelligence and intercept the Iranian barrage. But officials say it’s unclear if such a coalition could be stood up again so quickly and whether all of the countries are willing to participate once again. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of its top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. “Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday. The US still believes that no one in the region is interested in an all-out war engulfing the Middle East, officials say, but a potential miscalculation risks sparking a broader conflict.

According to the source, who had been briefed on the operation, the bomb was concealed about two months ago in the guest house where Haniyeh was known to stay in Tehran and detonated remotely once he was inside his room there. The Iranian government and Hamas say Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. US officials were briefed on the operation by Israeli officials only after the assassination, the source said. The New York Times was the first to report the details of Haniyeh’s assassination. Haniyeh’s assassination raised fears once again that Israel’s conflict with Hamas and its allies could develop into a multi-front, fully-fledged war in the Middle East. Iranian state media and Hamas previously indicated that Haniyeh was killed by a rocket fired from outside the building in which he was staying. But the revelation that a bomb was smuggled inside the guest house, which was under the protection of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, indicates a startling breach of security for the IRGC. CNN has sought comment from the Iranian government. An image published by the New York Times shows the building where Haniyeh is believed to have been assassinated. A corner of the building is now covered with a green cloth. Apparent debris also litters the ground floor roof of the building, directly underneath the green cloth. From Telegram/The New York Times It’s unclear when Haniyeh arrived in Tehran, but Iranian state media first reported that he would be flying in to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president on Monday. He had a full schedule of public appearances and meetings before he was assassinated, according to Iranian state media press reports. Haniyeh was first pictured on Tuesday, before the inauguration, meeting with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Iranian state media published images of Haniyeh meeting with Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian. Haniyeh was next spotted arriving at the inauguration ceremony at Iran’s Islamic Consultative Assembly building, where he sat in the front row. Just before 7:00 p.m. local time (11:30 a.m. ET), Haniyeh made his final public appearance at an exhibit at Tehran’s Milad Tower. At 2 a.m. that night, according to state media outlet IRNA, he was killed, with what IRNA described as an “airborne guided projectile.” Iranians gather for the memorial procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran, August 1.

According to Hamas and Qatari state media, Haniyeh’s funeral prayer will be held after the Friday prayer at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque in the Qatari capital, followed by the burial at the Imam Founder Cemetery in Lusail city. Video obtained by CNN showed Haniyeh’s wife, Umm al-Abed, crying over the coffin and mourning her husband. “You strengthened us every day, making us as strong and determined as iron. We owe it all to you,” she said. His death marked the start of an unpredictable new phase of Israel’s war with Hamas, coming just hours on from an Israeli strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr, whom it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah said Thursday that Israel’s killing of its top commander had “crossed red lines” and would be met with an “inevitable” response, hinting at coordination with other regional groups. Nasrallah delivered his speech remotely from a large screen in front of a crowd of mourners attending the funeral of Shukr, the highest-ranking Hezbollah commander to be killed by Israel since Mustafa Badreddine in 2016. Nasrallah said Israel’s strike in southern Beirut had prompted a “new phase” in the low-intensity battles between Israel and Iran-backed forces in the region. Iran-backed allies in the region include Iraqi proxy militias, the Houthis in Yemen and groups in Syria. ‘IDF is on high alert’ The chief spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Thursday that Israel was ready to face a range of scenarios amid heightened tension in the region. “The IDF is on high alert, on both defense and offense. IDF forces are deployed in the air, at sea and on the ground, and are prepared for all scenarios, especially for offensive plans within the immediate timeframe.” Hagari said at a briefing Thursday: “We have very good defense systems and in addition we have international partners who have reinforced their forces [deployed] in the region, to help us counter the threats.” But he cautioned that Israel’s defenses were “not hermetically sealed.” Hagari noted: “Iran has been running over the past few years a terror infrastructure, to smuggle Iranian explosive devices into Israeli territory to perpetrate attacks. We will continue operating against the Iranian terror with determination.” Several Israeli agencies and services are stepping up readiness, following the Israeli strike that killed Shukr and threats from Iran that it would retaliate following the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran.

A former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservist has alleged serious misconduct by Israeli forces in Gaza, and a lack of discipline in the command structure, in an interview with CNN.","Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Ami Kaufman,Middle East,"CNN — Destroyed homes, looting, and a desire for revenge. A former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservist has alleged serious misconduct by Israeli forces in Gaza, and a lack of discipline in the command structure, in an interview with CNN. Yuval Green, a 26-year-old former paratrooper, is one of a handful of soldiers who have served in Israel’s war against Hamas and are now publicly criticizing the way it is being prosecuted. Green described the behavior and alleged misdeeds of his reservist peers while serving in the Palestinian enclave, and the day he decided to tell his commanders he could no longer be part of his unit. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 others abducted in the assault, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli military action in the strip has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and injured over 90,000, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. As of early July, nearly 2 million people had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the United Nations. Green, who served as a medic in his unit, told CNN that prior to October 7 – when he was recruited for reserve duty – he had intended to leave the army, objecting to its conduct in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He had planned to tell his comrades on October 8, but after Hamas attacked, he felt duty-bound to support them as they were mobilized for the war. “When the 7th of October struck, it was difficult for me at this time to tell them that I’m not willing to come with them,” Green said. “So I decided to join my friends … I didn’t know what would be the right thing to do.” Yuval Green, a former Israeli paratrooper, speaks to CNN. CNN Atmosphere of ‘demonizing Gazans’ Green told CNN that he served in the Gaza perimeter in November last year before being sent into the strip on December 2, spending 51 days in the city of Khan Younis , in the south. He said that the anger felt by Israelis after October 7 and calls for revenge were expressed openly in his unit, as they waited to be sent into Gaza, and called it the “demonizing” of Palestinians. “In the days before we entered Khan Younis … there was this atmosphere that was kind of growing of demonizing the Gazans,” he said, adding that he heard people “speaking about killing, ruining all of Gaza. Wiping it out became something that people (were discussing), as if it was some kind of a legitimate idea.” IDF rules of engagement in Gaza have been under great scrutiny. Green claims that IDF commanders on the ground seemed to acquiesce to soldiers’ desires to have fewer restrictions on their conduct than in previous incursions. “I felt like my commanders were trying to kind of go with the soldiers and try to say things that they thought … (were) what the soldiers wanted to hear. You know, saying things like, ‘We’re not going to have any boundaries in Gaza this time.’” Green said he did not serve during earlier cycles of violence in Gaza but took part in guard duty on the Gaza perimeter and in the West Bank, as well as training.

Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images/File ‘We don’t care enough’ about Palestinian lives The war in Gaza has caused widespread material destruction to homes, infrastructure, hospitals and schools. Green says he witnessed the “unnecessary” destruction of Palestinian homes. “We’ve seen a lot of destruction that was not necessarily related to military reasons. Everything tends to (get) really mix up, you know – people are destroying houses because they believe that they should (get) revenge (for) what happened on (October 7) and it mixes up with the reasons to destroy houses for military reasons,” Green said, adding he witnessed “chaos … I could tell you 100% that we’ve destroyed houses at least for reasons that … we don’t care enough about the lives of Palestinians.” Describing the extent of the damage in Gaza, he said, “You can’t imagine it. Cities that are completely ruined.” Palestinians carry out search and rescue operations following an airstrike on December 7, 2023, in Khan Younis. Ahmad Hasaballah/Getty Images/File Accusations of looting Green told CNN that one of the things that bothered him most was witnessing what he alleged was the looting of Palestinian homes by soldiers in his own unit. “You’re seeing looting by your peers all the time. That was something (that) was very difficult for me to see. I mean, people were taking ‘souvenirs’ (from) the Palestinians’ houses, which I think directly relates to the demonization we’ve seen before the entrance to Khan Younis,” he said. “People were taking, you know, necklaces and doing graffiti on the walls and … leaving behind damage to the houses that was just completely unnecessary.” When asked if he thinks this behavior was condoned by IDF commanders, Green said that officially, they disapproved of such conduct – but were unable to stop it.

Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images Related article Killing of Hamas leader leaves Gaza ceasefire hopes dangling by a thread “The superior commanders of the IDF, I think they do believe that this shouldn’t happen – looting or graffiti,” Green said. “But I don’t think (the IDF) has the resources to stop it, and I think, you know, it all comes down to the soldiers (in) the field. You can’t stop any soldier from doing things.” While witnessing the alleged looting, Green said he confronted his peers, which resulted in “a lot of arguments,” but he was unable to sway his superiors to act: “Some of them agreed with me, some of them didn’t – or some of them, you know, were in between.” “But all of them weren’t able to control our actions.” The decision to leave In the end, one specific moment pushed Green to make the tough decision to leave his unit: when a commander allegedly ordered the burning of a Palestinian home they were stationed in. “At some point, my commander told my platoon to burn down the house we’re staying at,” Green recounted. “And I went to him, I approached him and I asked him, ‘Why are we doing that?’ And he gave me a few reasons, and I think those reasons were just not strong enough.” “They were, you know, military type of reasons, but they (were mixed up with) the revenge type of reasons. Now, I think this is just what’s going on in Gaza. Israel is doing things because it needs to fulfil a type of military purpose, but it all mixes up with our need for – or the Israeli need for – revenge.” Illustration by Alberto Mier/CNN Related article The US held off sanctioning this Israeli army unit despite evidence of abuses. Now its forces are shaping the fight in Gaza “I said, ‘I’m not willing to participate in that. I’m not destroying a house that belonged to a few families that would become homeless because of that – and I’m leaving.’ And I just (left) with the next car that went out.” Green said he decided to speak out publicly to put pressure on the Israeli government to accept a ceasefire and hostage deal . The Israeli government said this week that it was Hamas leadership that was preventing an agreement. “I think there are concrete deals on the table right now, that Hamas is agreeing to, that make sense. I mean, those deals say that all the hostages would be freed – and Israel is not accepting the ending of the war. And this is crazy,” Green said. Green added that Israel’s alleged refusal to accept a deal was causing the deaths of hostages. “I’ve seen it from within,” he said. “I mean, we said nothing before we entered Gaza about the hostages. We could have killed them, you know, any moment, and it’s something that has happened. We know about more than 10 hostages that were killed directly from Israeli bombings or, you know, the three hostages that were killed,” referring to an incident of friendly fire by the IDF in December, in which soldiers fatally shot three hostages . The possibility that hostages have been killed during Israeli bombardments is a sensitive one in Israel. There have been occasions when officials have announced that hostages were believed to have been killed while in captivity, but at no point have any such announcements been attributed to Israeli airstrikes. The Israeli army has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on Green’s claims. “We have to tell our government to stop the war. This is the only right solution to save the lives of Palestinians that are dying every day and going through a living hell the past few months, saving the lives of soldiers, Israeli soldiers, that are now present in Gaza and dying every day, and obviously the lives of hostages.” Israeli military vehicles in southern Israel, near the border with Gaza, on December 25, 2023. Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images/File Facing criticism at home In June, Green cosigned a letter with 40 other reservists refusing to serve in the southern Gaza city of Rafah . He is one of only three soldiers who have come out publicly, and his family and friends have voiced concern over his decisions. “Obviously it’s something very controversial in Israel, but I was willing to sacrifice, you know, my privacy and (to come) out with a topic as controversial as that, because I believe that right now, it’s a matter of life and death. “When people are criticizing me for that, and I’ve heard people … that said they were worried that I might get hurt in that process – that always felt very weird because, you know, I went inside Gaza. I literally have risked my life. But people are now more afraid that I might get hurt, you know, by just coming out with words,” he added. “It’s part of the problem with our situation right now.” Reflecting on the violence committed by Hamas, he also urged Palestinians not to support Hamas or call for an intifada: “They don’t understand that those calling for violence are damaging the Palestinian cause, and have been killing Palestinians for years now … I support Palestine too, but don’t confuse between supporting Palestine and supporting the violence of Hamas.” CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on Green’s allegations. Responding to Green’s allegations, the IDF stated: “The actions of the IDF and its operational activity in particular are subject to Israeli law and international law, which is reflected, among other things, in the rules of engagement among other military orders … IDF commanders are guided by values of the IDF ​​and lead the soldiers on the battlefield in a professional manner. When events that defer from the expected conduct occur, they are handled by the commanders as required. “In some cases, IDF forces are required to act to remove a threat posed to them from buildings located in the territory of the Gaza Strip. The destruction of buildings is done with the appropriate means. Actions done otherwise, and not as a result of operational needs, are contrary to the army’s orders and the IDF’s values ​​and are examined. Taking property that is not in accordance with the army’s orders is prohibited by law and is not in line with the values ​​of the IDF. Incidents in which forces acted not in accordance with the orders and the law are examined and will continue to be examined, including as part of investigations by the MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation Division). As a general rule, when details concerning concrete events are given, they are reviewed and dealt with accordingly.”"

The claim of Deif’s death comes a day after Hamas’ political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran. An Israeli military official told CNN they received new intelligence in recent hours that gave them the confidence to confirm Deif was killed, nearly three weeks after it carried out the strike in Khan Younis. The official declined to specify the nature of that intelligence. There was no immediate statement from Hamas. CNN has approached the militant group for comment. Palestinians cycle past destroyed buildings leveled in a previous Israeli military bombardment of Beit Lahia, in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday. Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images Related article Killing of Hamas leader leaves Gaza ceasefire hopes dangling by a thread A Hamas official wrote on Telegram that only the group’s military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, is able to confirm or deny Deif’s death. Izzat Al Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said that unless the Al Qassam leadership announces it, “no news published in the media or by any other parties can be confirmed.” A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had conducted a “precise, targeted strike” on a compound where Deif and another commander Rafe Salama were staying. The IDF announced Salama’s death last month. In recent weeks Israeli officials said they had indications their strike was successful but were not able to confirm that he was killed until now. The strike targeting Deif in Khan Younis on July 13 hit a designated humanitarian zone, killing at least 90 Palestinians. Footage from the Al-Mawasi displacement camp showed bodies in the street and destroyed tents. An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the architects of the October 7 attacks . He led the Palestinian militant group’s armed wing for more than two decades. Israel has repeatedly stated that one of its main war aims is to eliminate Hamas in Gaza. Deif’s death would make him the highest-ranking Hamas military official killed in the strip since the start of the war more than nine months ago.

Handout/Israel Defense Forces Israel says it has killed or captured half of Hamas’s commanders and more than 14,000 combatants since the war began. However, there are clear signs of the group’s resurgence in parts of the strip previously cleared by Israeli forces, who devastated large swathes of the area in the process. Israeli troops have been drawn back to these previously cleared parts of the territory, fighting pitched battles with Hamas units who were previously declared dismantled. Meanwhile, the group’s top leadership are likely to have had their communications compromised by the heavy bombardment, according to experts, with units operating more autonomously in their severely degraded form, and employing guerrilla tactics, such as laying booby traps and staging ambushes.

Born as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as “El Deif” or “the Guest” due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel.

This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated.” “Israel’s defense establishment will pursue Hamas terrorists – both the planners and the perpetrators of the 07.10 massacre. We will not rest until this mission is accomplished,” he added. This is a developing story and will be updated."
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/analysis-iran-options-ismail-haniyeh-killing-intl/index.html,Iran has no good options after two deadly strikes on senior allies,One of the few things working in Iran’s favor after the humiliating news that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital overnight is that the regime controls most of the information the world gets to see.,"Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Nick Paton Walsh,Middle East,"CNN — One of the few things working in Iran’s favor after the humiliating news that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital overnight is that the regime controls most of the information the world gets to see. What Iran has said so far is that Haniyeh died after being hit by an “airborne guided projectile” in Tehran where he was attending the inauguration of the Iranian president. But we know little else. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the strike but has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leaders following the October 7 attacks. Haniyeh’s death came hours after Israel confirmed it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon , on Tuesday that killed the most senior military commander of Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed militant group, who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The precise details of what happened at around 2 a.m. (5.30 p.m. ET) in Tehran, will dictate what comes next, as Iran looks to present a narrative that justifies and fashions its response. Whatever the truth and whatever Iran proffers, the attack is clearly a grave violation of its sovereignty and the supposed security bubble of the Iranian capital. Haniyeh was the regime’s guest, and its role as a regional power is compromised if it’s unable to guarantee the simple safety of visiting allies. There are reports he was staying in a guest house for veterans, and it is unclear whose technical responsibility it was to protect this facility – and whether the elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) will be explicitly embarrassed, outside of the wider humiliation of an apparent Israeli assassination deep inside of Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is seen with Haniyeh -- hours before his assassination. Handout/Office of Iran's Supreme Leader/AFP/Getty Images But Iran has stomached comparable violations in the past. The death of its leading nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was met with limited wrath in 2020. The killing of Quds commander Qasem Suleinami, the country’s most fabled military figure, months earlier, led to fiery rhetoric, but instead a limited hit on a remote US base. Iran has stepped back before – and may do so again. There is no shortage of furious rherotic the day after the strikes, but there is no easy route for Iran. It is clear Tehran has been reluctant, for the months since October 7, to launch its most ferocious proxy, Hezbollah, into a full-scale war with Israel from Lebanon. Putting aside the huge humanitarian horror such a conflict would muster for Lebanese and Israelis alike, Hezbollah remains a powerful card that Tehran gets to play probably once. The regime retains apparent ambitions in its nuclear program and a military eroded by sanctions, so Hezbollah is an ace that must be tabled with astute timing. Iran has also tried an unprecedented direct all-out attack on Israel before, in April, after senior IRGC commanders were killed in an Israeli strike on Damascus. In short, the 300 drone and missiles fired - straight from Iran at Israel - just didn’t get through. Around 99% of them were intercepted. Damage after the strike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday. Ahmad Al-Kerdi/Reuters The regime’s response to Haniyeh’s death will define its role as a regional power, and, if it fails to appear potent enough, risks that slipping. A stealthy, asymmetric strike, weeks from now, may not fix the damage done to its prestige. The risk of the unchartered territory we are in is that the gravity of expected responses is not defined – the tit for tat is occurring in an environment evolving by the day. Indeed, the characters making the decisions are changing rapidly, or under intense domestic pressure themselves. This simply accentuates the risk of miscalculation, or of actions taken to satisfy selfish, insular concerns, rather than a wider regional impact. In short, it is a mess that grows, and with it surges the chance of the unexpected. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s first statement on the matter said of Israel, “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment.” But remember this is a superannuated, octogenarian leader who has just endured years of popular unrest and rising conflict with Israel, and 24 hours ago saw a surprisingly moderate president, Masoud Pezeshkian, get sworn in. He is projecting strength internally as much as he is internationally. Separately, Hezbollah had stumbled it seemed into an acute crisis though the militant group’s apparently mistaken targeting of Druze schoolchildren in the Golan Heights at the weekend. It may feel the strike on Haniyeh has removed the spotlight to respond, for the shortest while, although it may be dragged into Iran’s eventual response. But the fact the assassination of its commander, Fuad Shukr, now seems like a distant memory, exposing how rapidly events are unfolding. Tehran is taking its time to reveal how, yet again, its innermost sanctum was violated by Israel. The IRGC trailed a statement about Haniyeh at 2.50 a.m. US time, but it eventually avoided most details of how he was killed. Perhaps it doesn’t know, or doesn’t want to say, or is working out what to say in order to find a response that fits – and that it can execute. Still, red lines have been criss-crossed for months, and this morning we lept a few rungs higher up the ladder of escalation. The agonizing question of the next 24 hours - as Iran fashions its narrative of how this major humiliation came to be - is what remaining steps are there on this well-trodden ladder, and what is at its peak?"
CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hamas political leader Haniyeh assassinated in Iran, plunging Middle East conflict into dangerous new phase","Hamas said its political leader has been killed in an overnight strike in the Iranian capital Tehran, a major development that throws the war between Israel and the militant group into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase.","Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-13 12:31:27.701089,Israel War,Rob Picheta,Middle East,"CNN — Hamas said its political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in an overnight strike in the Iranian capital Tehran, a major development that throws the war between Israel and the militant group into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase. Haniyeh’s death is, both strategically and symbolically, a dramatic blow to Hamas, eliminating its most public figure who headed up the group’s political operations while living overseas. He is the second leader of an Iran-backed group reported to have been assassinated in the last day, following the killing of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander in Lebanon. In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of targeting Haniyeh and his bodyguard in a “strike” on the building in which he was staying in Tehran, where he had participated in Tuesday’s inauguration of the new Iranian president. Hamas officials said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain” and described the killing as a “grave escalation,” while Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. According to the New York Times, which cited information provided by three Iranian officials, Khamenei issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing. At a news conference in Tehran later Wednesday, Hamas spokesperson and deputy head Khalil Al-Hayya said Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room where he was staying, and said Israel would “pay the price” for the “heinous crime.” Iranian state run media IRNA said the strike happened at around 2 a.m. local time (6:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday), involving an “airborne guided projectile.” Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was sworn in on Tuesday and Hamas released pictures the same day of Haniyeh meeting Iranian officials in Tehran. State-affiliated Fars said Haniyeh was staying in a residence in north Tehran. Israel’s military said it does not respond to reports in foreign media, though senior officials have previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leadership in response to the group’s October 7 attack on Israel. It later said it was “conducting a situational assessment.” In contrast, Israel did confirm it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr, whom it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Hezbollah later confirmed Shukr’s death. His assassination was the most serious Israeli escalation in its confrontation with the powerful Lebanese militant group since it restarted in earnest last October. Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, launched following the attacks led by the militant group on October 7, has sparked increasingly intense, near-daily ripples of conflict throughout the region. This week’s dual strikes, which came within several hours of each other, seemingly escalate that discord on multiple fronts, and will prompt renewed fears of an all-out war breaking out in the Middle East. In a televised address Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days, but did not mention the death of Haniyeh. “We’ll settle the score with anyone who harms us, anyone who massacres our children, anyone who murders our citizens,” Netanyahu said. In a bellicose speech, he said he did not “give in” to earlier calls to end the war in Gaza “and I am not giving in today.” He conceded “these are challenging days,” but stressed Israel is “ready for any scenario.” This week’s strikes may also dash any remaining hopes of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza being reached in the near future, amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the enclave. Haniyeh had played a leading role representing Hamas in months-long truce negotiations, which have repeatedly appeared to reach the cusp of a breakthrough, only to collapse at the last moment. In a statement after the strike, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum – which is campaigning to free the hostages still held in Gaza – said that “while (Israel’s) military operations over the past 10 months have achieved significant security gains, true achievement can only be realized with the release of all 115 hostages still in captivity.” It urged the Israeli government “to decisively advance negotiations.” Haniyeh photographed at the inauguration ceremony for the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Tuesday, hours before his death. Saman/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images Killing will ‘complicate’ ceasefire talks Haniyeh is the second Hamas senior leader to be killed since the war in Gaza began. In January, the group said the deputy head of its political bureau, Saleh Al Arouri, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Arouri was considered one of the founding members of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The impact of any single death in Hamas’ leadership structure is difficult to predict given the group’s vast and opaque network, and it has been able to weather the death of other key leaders before – including the slaying of its co-founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, killed weeks apart in 2004. But Haniyeh’s death leaves Hamas without its public political figurehead, and likely represents a major setback to its international operations. It would not be expected to dramatically impact its military effort, but his demise may carry symbolic weight throughout the organization.

Ronen Zvulun/Reuters/File Related article Netanyahu reverses on key Israeli concession in ceasefire talks He had taken a central role in hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, and earlier this spring said Hamas was willing to strike a deal – but added it would require Israel withdrawing from Gaza and a guarantee to cease fighting in the enclave permanently, demands that Israel has called “unacceptable.” A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN on Wednesday that Haniyeh’s death could “complicate mediation talks.” The source said Haniyeh – along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar – was a “key decision maker.” “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source added. Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt as recently as early July . Those talks now hang in the balance, despite some hope earlier this month that they were nearing a framework agreement. “How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a mediator in the talks, posted on X on Wednesday. Qatar’s capital, Doha, also hosts the main Hamas political bureau. “Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life,” Al-Thani wrote. Dual deaths raise fears of all-out war The killings of Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah’s Shukr in Beirut are significant in both their timing and location. Brigadier General (Res.) Assaf Orion, senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies think tank, said the two deaths “increase the likelihood of an axis response, adding Iran and other proxy attacks to the menu.” Iran has spent years investing in regional proxy groups, informally known as the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance – supplying them with money, weapons, and training as Tehran has sought to broaden its influence across the Middle East.

Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Khamenei said in a statement referring to Israel. “We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.” Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has brought that longstanding shadow war with Iran out into the open – and inflamed opinion globally. In a speech at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday, Iran’s ambassador to the UN blamed the United States for the death of Haniyeh, saying it could not have happened without US authorization and intelligence support. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the US was “not aware of or involved in” the killing. In calls with both the Jordanian and Qatari foreign ministers, Blinken said it was important to continue the ceasefire talks and to prevent “further escalation of the conflict,” according to State Department readouts. Meanwhile, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, while traveling in the Philippines, said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but if Israel were to be attacked the United States would help defend it. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military, said Haniyeh’s death was under investigation and results will be announced later Wednesday, according to Iranian state media. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Haniyeh’s killing calling it “a cowardly act and a dangerous development,” according to the WAFA news agency on Wednesday. “His Excellency called on the masses and forces of our people to unite, be patient and steadfast in the face of the Israeli occupation,” WAFA reported. A Hamas member for decades Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising. As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. By 2017 he had become chief of the group – and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the US soon after. Some Palestinians expressed shock and sadness at his death on Wednesday. “Ismail Haniyeh is the son of Gaza. He represents my entire people,” Ahmad Al Nims told a journalist working with CNN in Deir el-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip.

Another Gazan, Abu Yasser Hassoun, said the assassination had “struck” Palestinians “like a thunderbolt.” Palestinian analyst Mustafa Ibrahim told CNN that despite some disagreements, Haniyeh held a “special place among the Palestinians.” Over the years, Haniyeh has participated in peace talks with former US President Jimmy Carter , and met with other world leaders including the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian earlier this year. In April, Israeli air strikes killed three of Haniyeh’s sons and four of his grandchildren, according to Hamas. At the time, Haniyeh insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks. “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said. How Haniyeh spent the months after Oct. 7 After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis. CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track Haniyeh’s movements since October 7. Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt. The Hamas leader also spent two periods of time in Istanbul. He watched the October 7 attacks unfold in Hamas’ Istanbul offices. Video that circulated social media following the attacks show him celebrating after watching news reports of Hamas fighters returning to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment. He returned home to Doha in October after the attacks, and took another 14 day-trips there in April. While there in April, Haniyeh met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in addition to a number of Turkish politicians. Haniyeh’s body will be buried in Doha on Friday, after funerals are held for him in Tehran on Thursday.

Sign up here. CNN — The assassination of the political leader of Hamas has plunged the Middle East into fresh crisis and dented already slim hopes of an end to the war between Israel and the militant group that rules Gaza anytime soon. Hamas on Wednesday said Israel killed its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh , in Tehran, Iran, hours after Israel claimed a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s killing. Experts say the assassinations throw an ominous shadow on efforts to procure a ceasefire-hostage deal in Gaza, as well as hopes of de-escalation between Israel and its Iran-backed rivals in the region. Here’s what the killing of the Hamas and Hezbollah leaders means for the Gaza war and the region. Future of ceasefire talks unclear Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas had already hit repeated roadblocks before Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed on Tuesday night. As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement. All of that could now be thrown up in the air by his death.

Vahid Salemi/AP Related article What we know about the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s assassination could “complicate mediation talks,” as he had been “instrumental” to their progress. The source said Haniyeh was a “key decision-maker,” along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source said, adding that “at this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on ceasefire talks.” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas talks, wrote on X: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?” Qatar, which has helped release some of the Israeli hostages, sheltered the Hamas leader before his death, and the group’s political bureau has been based in its capital Doha since 2012. Questions will also be asked about the calculations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who many observers – including families of the hostages – have accused of deliberately stalling on negotiations and dragging out the war to safeguard his own political survival. “Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged ceasefire talks because ending the war will likely end his political career,” said Trita Parsi of the Quincy Institute, a US-based foreign policy think tank, in a post on X. “The assassination buys Netanyahu several weeks, if not months, in which there will be no serious expectation of a ceasefire deal.” People stand near a wall covered with pictures of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks, during a demonstration against the Israeli government, in the northern Israel city of Karmiel on July 25. Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, noted that negotiations were already deadlocked even before the assassination of Haniyeh. Now, Baskin said, it is unclear how much longer Qatari and Egyptian mediators will allow themselves “to be played by Israel and Hamas,” adding that it may be time for the mediators to put a deal on the table and ask parties to “take it or leave it.” “And if they leave it, perhaps it’s time for them to leave the parties to themselves,” Baskin told CNN. A faltered negotiation process also extends the risk to the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The Hostages Families Forum said Wednesday that “true achievement” in the war can only be realized with the release of all hostages still in captivity, saying they “implore the Israeli government and global leaders to decisively advance negotiations.” “Time is of the essence,” the Forum said in a statement. “This is the time for a deal.” There are 111 hostages still in Gaza, including 39 believed to be dead, according to data from Netanyahu’s office. Their families have repeatedly slammed Netanyahu for failing to secure their release. No respite for the suffering in Gaza Without a ceasefire, Gaza’s besieged population will find no respite from the war, which has so far killed more than 39,000 people, according to the health ministry in the strip. Swathes of the territory have been flattened, and a humanitarian crisis is rapidly spiraling out of control. The war, which Israel launched in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, has also displaced almost all of Gaza’s population of 2 million, with 86% of the territory now under Israeli evacuation orders. Qatar’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said Haniyeh’s killing “would lead to the region sliding into a cycle of chaos and undermine the chances of peace.” Aftermath of an Israeli military strike on a building in Beirut's southern suburb on Tuesday. Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images Egypt, a key mediator in the conflict but whose ties with Israel have been strained since October 7, had condemned what it called “Israel’s dangerous policy of escalation” and warned against “the nonsense policy of assassination and violation of the sovereignty of states.” In a statement, Egypt said the two killings risk “igniting” confrontation in the region. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the United States was “not aware of or involved in” Haniyeh’s killing and that the Biden administration had been working “from day one” for a ceasefire to prevent the conflict from spreading to other regions. HA Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, said that unless there is an active effort to cool tensions in the region, “escalation will happen by, unfortunately, default.” “The United States has not been willing to use the leverage it actually has on Israel… in order to force Israel into a serious negotiation position,” Hellyer told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “This isn’t sustainable.” CNN’s Mostafa Salem contributed to this report."

The attack on Haniyeh came in the early hours of Wednesday morning, with Hamas pointing the finger at Israel – which has so far declined to comment. All eyes will now focus on two key questions. What happens to Gaza hostage and ceasefire negotiations, given Haniyeh headed up the group’s political operations from overseas and acted as a key interlocuter with international mediators? And will this strike inside Iran prove to be the catalyst for a potential full-blown regional war? Here’s what we know so far. What happened? Haniyeh had been in Tehran for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and was staying in a residence for veterans in the north of the city, state-affiliated news outlet Fars reported. Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room in which he was staying, Hamas spokesperson and deputy head Khalil Al-Hayya said at a news conference in Tehran. He said Israel would “pay the price” for the “heinous crime.” Earlier, Iranian state media IRNA reported that an “airborne guided projectile” had targeted the building at around 2 a.m. local time. IRNA said Haniyeh’s bodyguard was also killed, and that further investigations are underway to determine the details of the operation and the position from where the projectile was fired. Shortly afterward, Hamas decried what it called a “Zionist strike” and a “grave escalation” in its decades long conflict with Israel. One Hamas official said the group is “ready to pay various prices” and that the “moment of truth has come,” adding: “This assassination will not achieve the goals of the occupation and will not push Hamas to surrender.” When asked for comment, Israel’s military said it “doesn’t respond to reports in the foreign media.” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (right) meets Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh (left) at the president's office in Tehran, Iran, on July 30, 2024. Iranian Presidency Office/AP Who was Haniyeh? Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising. As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. He became political chief of Hamas in 2017. The following year, he was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States. Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization. During the war with Israel in Gaza he has taken a central role in hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. Earlier this spring, he said Hamas was willing to strike a deal – but it would require Israel withdrawing from Gaza and a guarantee to cease fighting in the enclave permanently, demands that Israel has called “unacceptable.” How does this impact ceasefire talks? Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt as recently as early July . Those talks now hang in the balance, despite some hope earlier this month that they were nearing a framework agreement. A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s death could “complicate mediation talks.” The source said Haniyeh was “instrumental” in getting certain breakthroughs in negotiations and – along with the Hamas military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar – was a “key decision maker.” “How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a mediator on the talks, posted on X on Wednesday. Qatar’s capital, Doha, also hosts the main Hamas political bureau. “Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life,” Al-Thani wrote. Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid said on Wednesday. In a statement after the strike, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government “to decisively advance negotiations,” to secure the release of the hostages who have been held in Gaza since the October 7 attack on Israel. “While military operations over the past 10 months have achieved significant security gains, true achievement can only be realized with the release of all 115 hostages still in captivity,” it said. “The deal proposed by the Israeli government and supported by President Biden represents the only viable path to secure their freedom, allowing the living to begin rehabilitation and the murdered to receive proper burial.” Video Ad Feedback The assassination of Hamas' political leader deepens fears of an all-out war in the Middle East 03:58 - Source: CNN What has the world said? Leaders from around the region have weighed in, with some condemning the killing and voicing alarm about the potential fallout. Palestinian leaders, including the Palestinian president and prime minister – who come from factions that have deep historical rivalries with Hamas – have condemned the killing and called for Palestinian “national unity.” The White House has seen the reports of Haniyeh’s killing, a spokesperson said, but declined to immediately comment further. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but that the US would help defend Israel if it were attacked. Leaders from Russia and Turkey have both decried the assassination, warning it would lead to larger conflicts in the region. Other Iran-backed militant groups have also voiced sympathy – including Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. Two reported killings, in quick succession News of Haniyeh’s killing came just hours after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon.

If true, Shukr would be the most high-ranking Hezbollah official to have been assassinated since 2016 when Mustafa Badreddine, the group’s top commander at the time, was killed in Syria. Whatever the fate of Shukr, Wednesday’s strike marked the most serious Israeli escalation since confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel began on October 8.

Hamas and Iranian state media said Wednesday that the 62-year-old had been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran . Hamas claimed Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli “strike” on his residence, while the Israeli military declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Haniyeh’s death strikes a significant blow to Hamas at a time when tensions are flaring across the Middle East over the devastating war in Gaza, and raises fraught questions about the future of negotiations between Israel and Hamas. As Hamas’s political leader, he was a key interlocutor with international mediators during stalled hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, following the group’s October 7 attack on Israel. Haniyeh was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising against Israel’s occupation in Gaza and the West Bank. His parents were refugees expelled from Askalan, which later became known as the Israeli city Ashkelon. He was imprisoned several times in Israel for his participation in the uprising, before being deported and returning to Gaza – where he steadily climbed Hamas ranks in the following decade. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (right) meets Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh (left) at the president's office in Tehran, Iran, on July 30, 2024. Iranian Presidency Office/AP Haniyeh was appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004 after the deaths of Hamas’ founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who were killed in Israeli strikes just weeks apart. After Hamas won elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006, Haniyeh became prime minister of the Palestinian Authority (PA) government, but it was short lived. He was dismissed after a year in office by PA President Mahmoud Abbas and remains the only PA prime minister to have taken office after securing a mandate in popular elections. A year later, Hamas seized Gaza after a short-lived, but bloody conflict with the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority, Fatah. Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the territory shortly after that, alongside Egypt. Though regarded as Hamas’s leader in Gaza for many years, Haniyeh did not become the group’s overall political leader until 2017, when he took over from Khaled Meshaal who had led Hamas in exile since 2004. A year later, Haniyeh was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States – which came during a period of tension between Washington and the Palestinians due to the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision made by the then-US President Donald Trump. Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization. He was photographed meeting Iran’s news President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran on Tuesday. Ceasefire and hostage release talks Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 saw at least 1,500 Hamas fighters pour across the border into Israel, in an assault that killed at least 1,200, and some 200 others taken hostage. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health there, and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe in the densely crowded strip. In the months since, Haniyeh had been a key figure participating in international negotiations over the conflict, including the release of hostages still in Gaza. He had shown willingness to reach an agreement if Israel withdrew from Gaza – saying in May that the group was “still keen” to strike a deal with mediators, but that any proposal would have to cease fighting in the enclave permanently.

As recently as early July , Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement. Given his role in negotiations, Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid on Wednesday.

Nine days later, Israeli airstrikes killed three of his sons and four of his grandchildren.
