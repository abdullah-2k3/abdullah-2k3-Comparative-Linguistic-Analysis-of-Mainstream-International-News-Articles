            Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced a 24-hour hotline for Kursk region residents who want to evacuate to Ukraine. 
     
        “Due to the possible deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the adjacent territories of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must be ready to receive Russian refugees. Therefore, the Ministry of Reintegration has opened a 24-hour hotline for residents of the Kursk region who need humanitarian aid or want to evacuate to Ukraine,” Vereshchuk posted to Telegram on Wednesday. “Ukraine complies with all norms of international humanitarian law. We will provide the civilians of the Kursk region with the necessary protection and humanitarian support,” she continued.
     
 
            Russian authorities announced a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday for the border village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Kursk Gov. Alexei Smirnov shared the news on Telegram, stating that the regional operational headquarters decided to evacuate residents after the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk. 
     
            Glushkovo is situated about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the Ukrainian border and 117 kilometers (72.7 miles) southwest of the city of Kursk. The evacuation will be coordinated by law enforcement, the Russian military, and local government officials, he said 
     
            It is unclear how many people this evacuation will affect. 
     
            Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets says he is in contact with his Russian counterpart about prisoners of war captured over the last week.
     
            “You have seen the videos of Russian soldiers surrendering. You can see that the Ukrainian Armed Forces, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, take prisoners and ensure the rights of Russian prisoners of war. No one tortures them, no one shoots at them, unlike the Russian Armed Forces,” Lubinets said on Ukrainian television Wednesday.
     
            Lubinets added that prisoners were taken “to special military camps, which Ukraine has established in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.”
     
            He said there had been a “proactive” discussion with his Russian counterpart on the issue of prisoner exchanges.
     
        “At any time, Ukraine is ready to continue exchange processes based on the Geneva Conventions,” Lubinets said. “We have priority categories that we are ready to exchange. First of all, these are the seriously wounded, Ukrainian women and all those who are in captivity,” he said. 
     
 
            Ukraine is distributing humanitarian aid and food to civilians and will open evacuation corridors if asked to do so by the local population, he said.   
     
            Residents evacuated from the southwestern Russian region of Kursk have recounted the fearful moment their locality came under Ukrainian attack. 
     
            Russian emergency ministry released video Wednesday of evacuations carried out in the Lgov and Rylsk districts of the Kursk region. In the video, evacuation workers can be seen assisting elderly residents carrying their belongings onto buses. 
     
            Rylsk lies around 16 miles from the border with Ukraine and has a population of roughly 15,000 whilst Lgov lies around 29 miles from the border and has a population of roughly 17,500. 
     
            An elderly woman named Galina described how Ukrainian forces hit “the houses point blank” in her area, recounting how she luckily managed to escape to a basement for shelter, according to a Reuters translation of the video. 
     
        “I was told: ‘Let’s go, it’s easier to walk on the road.’ And there we saw some military men, communication operators. I walked to them to ask for directions and they said ‘We’ll drive you and help, just show the documents, you know how it is.’ I was scared myself,” Galina added. 
     
 
            Meanwhile, Ukraine has accused Russia of neglecting its civilians in Kursk with the Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko claiming that residents “were abandoned by Russia without the most necessary things.” 
     
            Klymenko said the military was now coordinating with his office regarding “the needs of the locals for drinking water, food, medicines and hygiene kits so that we can organize humanitarian aid as soon as possible.”
     
            Russia hasn’t yet publicly responded to Ukraine’s accusation.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lauded Ukraine’s military for carrying out what he called “precise, timely and effective” strikes on Russian airfields on Wednesday.
     
            Ukraine conducted its “biggest attack” on Russian airfields since the war began, with drones targeting four Russian airfields overnight, a source at the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday. 
     
            Zelensky said Ukrainian drones are working as they should, but he cautioned that there are operations that can’t be done with drones alone. 
     
        “We need other weapons — missile weapons. And we continue to work with our partners on long-range solutions for Ukraine,” he said. 
     
 
Remember: Western allies of Ukraine have been reluctant to supply Kyiv with long-range missiles that can penetrate deep into Russian territory. 
     
            CNN has uncovered online job vacancies for trench diggers in Russia’s Kursk region, as satellite imagery shows a new trench system has been dug in the region. 
     
            “Friends, they asked me to publish this announcement from Kurchatov,” said one user in a group called Typical Lgov on the Russian social media website Vkontakte. Kurchakov is a nearby town adjacent to the Kursk nuclear power plant.
     
        “We need people to dig trenches in Lgov. They also have equipment but no drivers. Payment every week,” it added. 
     
 
            Meanwhile, a construction company in the distant region of Bashkortostan posted a job listing on the website Avito, announcing that workers are needed for digging trenches in Kursk region. It said workers would be paid between $1,600 to $4,000 a month. 
     
            “We provide: Three meals a day; All necessary tools; Work clothes; Transportation to the place of work at the expense of the company,” the advertisement said.
     
            Satellite images from the last two days show a sizable trench has been dug across the countryside near the city of Lgov in Russia’s Kursk region — in what is apparently a new defensive precaution on the part of Russian authorities as a Ukrainian military cross-border incursion continues into a second week.
     
            Four images, provided to CNN by satellite imagery provider Maxar, show different sections of a trench dug near the town of Selektsionnyi, which is a few kilometers to the west of Lgov.
     
            Lgov is some 60 kilometers (about 37 miles) from the Ukrainian border by road, and about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from what is thought to be the deepest penetration of Ukrainian troops.
     
            The trench appears to have been dug close to a major highway and rail line.
     
            Ukrainian officials have been expanding on what they see as a “buffer zone” inside Russia, which they say will protect better communities in northern Ukraine.
     
            Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said Wednesday that during “this summer alone, the Russians launched more than 2,000 strikes on the territory of Sumy region. They used missiles, artillery, UAVs, attack drones, and mortars.”
     
            Klymenko said more than 20,000 people had been evacuated. Sumy shares a long border with Russian territory. 
     
        “The creation of a buffer zone in the Kursk region is a step to protect our border communities from daily enemy attacks,” he said on Telegram.
     
 
            He also said that Russian civilians in parts of the Kursk region now controlled by the Ukrainian military “were abandoned by Russia without the most necessary things.” The Ukrainian military is coordinating with his ministry on “the needs of the locals for drinking water, food, medicines and hygiene kits so that we can organize humanitarian aid as soon as possible…”
     
            Volodymyr Artiukh, the head of Sumy regional military administration, told Ukrainian television Wednesday there had been “an increase in the enemy’s use of aviation in recent days. 
     
        “These are guided aerial bombs, famous for their destructive power. On average, 40 to 60 guided bombs are dropped on our settlements and communities. Therefore, there are great destructions and civilian casualties, wounded and killed,” he added.
     
 
            The Russian defense ministry had previously said that its aviation was attacking Ukrainian reserves in Sumy.
     
            Artiukh said that authorities were enforcing an exclusion zone of 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) from the border. 
     
            “This is done to avoid endangering the civilian population. There are cases when citizens return after leaving,” he said. 
     
            German authorities have issued an international arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man suspected of carrying out the explosions that damaged Nord Stream gas pipelines two years ago.
     
            The explosions left gas billowing from Nord Stream 1 and 2 — two major conduits that transported Russian gas to Europe — and prompted a huge operation to find who was responsible.
     
            The origin of the explosions has been a subject of intense speculation and further stoked political tensions in Europe seven months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Neither of the pipelines were actively transporting gas to Europe at the time of the leaks, though they still held gas under pressure.
     
            A spokesperson for Poland’s Public Prosecutors Office, Anna Adamiak, confirmed Poland had received a warrant from Germany seeking the arrest of a Ukrainian man, named as Volodymyr Z. She added that he had left Poland and was not arrested because he was not on a database of wanted people.
     
            The news comes after three German outlets reported that the man — described as a male diver — along with two other Ukrainian suspects, are believed by German federal prosecutors to have launched an audacious underwater attack on the pipeline from a sailing boat in September 2022.
     
            After a joint investigation, German outlets ARD, Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Wednesday that the arrest warrant for the man had been sent to Poland’s government to approve in June. Germany’s Federal Public Prosecutor General did not comment on the reports when contacted by CNN. Die Zeit reported that the man denied involvement when contacted by the outlet.

            Russia has pulled reserves from key battleground areas in Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea in an effort to hold back Ukrainian advances into Russian territory, a Ukrainian military commander told CNN Wednesday. 
     
            Dymtro Kholod, commander of the “Nightingale” battalion, told a CNN team on the ground in Sumy that the military has “information” suggesting Russian soldiers are being pulled from Zaporizhzhia, Crimea, and Kharkiv to halt Ukraine’s continued advances into Russia’s Kursk region. 
     
        “(The Russians) are now trying to stop our advance; they have pulled in reserves, which has benefited our defense forces in other areas, because it has become easier to work there,” he said. 
     
 
            “Of course, it will be harder for us to advance further, but we will still advance,” he added.
     
            Alongside his unit, Kholod said he joined Ukraine’s forces on day one of their surprise cross-border incursion into Russia and only left the Kursk region on Wednesday. 
     
            Russian troops were shocked by Ukraine’s “rapid advance,” Kholod said, adding, “They were in tactical encounters and willingly surrendered to the defense forces.” 
     
        “They are ready to die for our land for some reason, but for some reason, they are not ready to die for their own land,” he said.
     
 
            Ukrainian Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk said that the operation in Russia’s Kursk region is designed to protect the border regions of Ukraine — primarily the border of the Sumy region, which has seen persistent Russian artillery and missile fire throughout the war.
     
            Vereshchuk said Wednesday that “the Ukrainian Defense Forces are creating a security zone on the territory of the Russian Federation adjacent to the territory of Ukraine.” 
     
        “There are Russian civilians within this zone. They are protected by international humanitarian law, which Ukraine fully complies with,” she said, so the Ukrainian military would “conduct humanitarian operations to support civilians within the mentioned zone” as well as open corridors for civilians to evacuate, either into Ukraine or within Russia.
     
 
            A Ukrainian television report that aired Wednesday showed packages of food and water being distributed to Russian civilians in one neighborhood of the Kursk region that is now under Ukrainian control.
     
            The Russian defense ministry said its forces continue to “repel an attempt by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to invade the territory of the Russian Federation,” one week after a Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region began.
     
            The ministry said Wednesday that the northern group of forces, supported by air and drone strikes, had prevented efforts by Kyiv’s troops to make further advances “deep into Russian territory.” It mentioned small settlements, including Skrylevka and Levshinka, that are some 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) from the border.
     
            Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had advanced 1 to 2 kilometers into the Kursk region.
     
            The Russian ministry published video purporting to show the capture of several Ukrainian soldiers near the town of Martynovka, but CNN is unable to verify the location of the video or the identity of those seen in it.  It claimed the Ukrainians had lost up to 270 servicemen and 16 armored vehicles, publishing video it purported to show the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.
     
            The ministry said that “in the area of ​​Martynovka, two enemy groups on pickups were discovered and destroyed.” Martynovka is a few kilometers northeast of the town of Sudzha, where Ukrainian forces have been present since last Wednesday. Videos geolocated by CNN show a continued Ukrainian military presence in settlements near Sudzha.
     
            The Russian ministry also said its aircraft had carried out strikes on Ukrainian reserves on the other side of the border in Ukraine’s Sumy region. It’s unclear how far Russia is redeploying units from other areas along the front lines to bolster the defense of Kursk, but it does appear to be redirecting reserves.
     
            For its part, the Ukrainian General Staff said that anti-aircraft missiles brought down a Russian Su-34 combat aircraft in the Kursk region on Tuesday night.
     
            Oleh Syniehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional military administration in Ukraine, said he has not seen a withdrawal of Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction.
     
            Russia’s air defenses destroyed 117 “aircraft-type UAVs” and four tactical missiles overnight, its defense ministry said on Wednesday.
     
            Of those unmanned aerial vehicles — also known as drones — 37 of them were destroyed over the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched its surprise cross-border incursion last week. The four missiles were also destroyed in the same region.
     
            More than 35 Ukraine-launched drones were also destroyed over the southwestern region of Voronezh, which borders both Kursk and Belgorod regions, Voronezh Gov. Aleksandr Gusev said in a Telegram post on Wednesday.
     
            There were no casualties from the attack, Gusev said, adding that “several residential and non-residential properties, municipal infrastructure, and vehicles were damaged as a result of the fall of UAV debris.” 
     
            The risk of further drone attacks in the region is “still present,” he added.
     
            Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas claimed Tuesday that Russia was moving its troops from strategically significant territory of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast to the southern Russian region of Kursk, where Kyiv says its forces continue to advance after a surprise cross-border incursion last week.
     
            CNN cannot independently confirm the claim and is reaching out to Moscow for comment.
     
            Kaliningrad is a Russian exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania.
     
            “We are now seeing them redeploying their troops from Kaliningrad to Kursk. We call it the demilitarization of Kaliningrad,” Kasciunas said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a video of the meeting posted on his Telegram account. It’s not clear if Kasciunas provided any evidence to back his claim during the meeting.
     
            The Lithuanian minister called Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk “a good move and a completely new page.”
     
            Ukrainian Ground Forces spokesperson Dmytro Lykhovii told Ukrainian media Tuesday that “some Russian military units” were moved to Kursk from occupied southern Ukraine. Lykhovii caveated, however, that Russia had already amassed “a large number of personnel” in the southern Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia region. 
     
            Russia announced that they would be putting peace talks with Ukraine “on a long pause” after Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region last week.
     
            “With their terrorist actions in the Kursk area Ukraine has, at minimum, put the peace talks track on pause for a long time,” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s special envoy Rodion Miroshnik said at a briefing on Wednesday.
     
            Miroshnik said he thinks Ukraine’s incursion was done “deliberately” to stall negotiations. 
     
            Peace efforts have long floundered. Russia has called on Ukraine to give up four of its  eastern regions, something Kyiv considers unacceptable.
     
            The exact purpose of Ukraine’s attack on Kursk is not known, but there is speculation it could be seeking a stronger hand should negotiations take place. 
     
            A week into Ukraine’s surprise cross-border incursion into Russia, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Moscow does not have the situation under control.
     
            The incursion — the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II — is a major embarrassment for the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to “kick the enemy out” of Russia, but his troops are yet to stop the Ukrainian advance.
     
Here’s what we know:
 
What’s happening? The first reports of Ukrainian troops crossing into Russia’s Kursk region, just north of the Ukrainian border, started to emerge late last Tuesday. But it wasn’t until several days later that Kyiv officially acknowledged its military was operating inside Russia.
     
            It marks a notable change of tactics from Ukraine, which has previously attacked targets inside Russia with drones and missiles, but until last week had not launched any official ground incursions across the border.
     
            By Monday, Kyiv claimed to have control over some 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory. That’s similar to the amount of Ukrainian land Russia managed to seize so far this year.
     
Why is Ukraine doing this? Kyiv is likely trying to achieve several goals: reclaim the initiative and boost the morale of its soldiers while diverting Russia’s attention and embarrassing Putin.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said over the weekend that the incursion was a way to put “pressure on the aggressor.”
     
            It comes after Ukraine has been under increased pressure along the 600-mile front line as Moscow in recent months, even as long-awaited US military aid started to arrive to the front. Moscow’s slow, grinding offensive along the entire front line has been forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive.
     
            The Ukrainian government said it didn’t intend to annex Russia’s territory in the same way Moscow has annexed Crimea and other areas seized from Ukraine.

            Ukraine has conducted its “biggest attack” on Russian airfields since the war began, with drones targeting four Russian airfields overnight, a source at the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN on Wednesday. 
     
            The SBU source told CNN the attack was a joint operation between various arms of the Ukraine’s defense, including the  SBU, Air Force and Special Forces.
     
            The source also said airfields in Russian cities of Voronezh, Kursk, Savasleyka and Borisoglebsk were targeted.
     
            Earlier, the Ukrainian Air Force destroyed a Russian Su-34 fighter jet in the Kursk region, according to a statement by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
     
            This map shows where Ukraine has made its incursion into Russia’s Kursk region. 
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed he has no intention of annexing the Russian territory, rather that the intention is to destroy Russian positions that are used to launch strikes against Ukraine. 
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s forces are advancing in Russia’s Kursk region by 1 to 2 kilometers (about .6 to 1.2 miles) since the beginning of the day on Wednesday.
     
            “We are advancing in the Kursk region, 1 to 2 kilometers in various areas since the beginning of the day,” Zelensky said in a video call with the Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Wednesday.
     
            Zelensky also said that 100 Russian servicemen have also been captured, adding that this will “accelerate the return of our guys and girls.”
     
            Syrskyi said in the call with Zelensky that the main efforts are concentrated on the Toretsk and Pokrovsk directions to “prevent the enemy from advancing and inflicting maximum losses.”
     
            Earlier, video posted by AFP at the Ukrainian border crossing between Ukraine’s Sumy region and Russia’s Kursk region showed a Ukrainian truck carrying blindfolded men in Russian military uniform traveling away from the Russian border.
     
            CNN has reached out to Ukrainian military on the video.
     
            The governor of Russia’s border area of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, declared a regional emergency on Wednesday after new attacks by Ukrainian forces and as Kyiv claims control of hundreds of square miles of Russian territory. 
     
            “The situation in the Belgorod region continues to be extremely difficult and tense,” Gladkov said in a video message posted Wednesday on his Telegram account. 
     
            The declaration comes after Belgorod began evacuations on Monday as a result of Ukrainian advances, following Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion into the neighboring Kursk region last week.
     
            Gladkov said regional authorities are appealing to the Russian government to declare a federal emergency.
     
            Two locations in the Belgorod region were attacked by Ukrainian forces using drones, the governor said Wednesday. There were no casualties in the attacks, which were on the city of Shebekino and village of Ustinka, but two residences were damaged, according to Gladkov.
     
            Ukraine has claimed control of hundreds of square miles of Russian territory, with Russian President Vladimir Putin vowing on Monday to “kick the enemy out” after it emerged that dozens of Russian villages were under Ukrainian control.
     
            Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed Kyiv’s forces have taken control of over 40 square kilometers (over 15 square miles) inside Russia’s southwestern Kursk region in the past 24 hours.
     
            “The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue operation on the territory of the Kursk region. Today, our troops advanced in separate directions from 1 to 3 kilometers,” Syrskyi said in a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday.  
     
            “Control over 40 square kilometers of the territory was taken,” he added.
     
            Syrskyi reiterated what Zelensky had said, that 74 settlements are now under Ukrainian control, with battles being fought along the entire front line.
     
        “The situation, despite the high intensity of hostilities, is under control, we continue the operation,” he said. 
     
 
            On Monday, Syrskyi said the country’s forces control about 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory in Kursk.

            There was a large mingling of the freed Americans, their families and officials, including US hostage envoy Roger Carstens, in a large aircraft hangar at the joint base in San Antonio.
     
            Carstens flew with the returnees and their families from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to Texas. The group posed for photos, including with the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag.
     
            “This is us down here. Those last three, that’s us,” Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who was detained in Russian prisons for nearly six years, said, pointing at the tally marks on the flag.  
     
        “So great to welcome you here at the joint base,” Carstens told the group. “The next phase of your journey begins now.”
     
 
            An official explained the next steps, including medical ones. He said they should “get some rest and recuperation.”
     
            Whelan spoke at the base, at one point holding up a box with an iPad, saying that Russia’s Federal Security Service stole his “iPad and iPhone, so this is a replacement so I can be normal again.” He also appeared to hold a bag with a bottle of alcohol, joking that that was for “medicinal purposes.”
     
            He confirmed he was wearing the flag lapel pin given to him by President Joe Biden, saying it was a “keepsake.”
     
            “It didn’t feel real until we were flying over England,” he said, noting his British citizenship. “As we came over England and I looked down, that’s when it became real.”
     
        “Getting off the plane and seeing the president, the vice president, that was nice. It was a good homecoming,” Whelan said. “I’m looking forward to seeing my family down here and recuperating from five years, seven months, five days of just absolute nonsense from the Russian government.”
     
 
            Whelan credited his family’s “harsh words” with the government on “having to keep them accountable for taking care of us.”
     
            Whelan also expressed gratitude to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Carstens and his team, and “other government agencies you’ll find out about.” 
     
            The other returnees did not speak to the press. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva also landed in the United States on Thursday. 
     
            American journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan were among the 24 detainees released Thursday as part of a complex prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations.
     
            A host of Russian dissidents were also freed while in return Moscow got a former FSB colonel convicted of murder as well as several individuals accused of spying or cybercrime.
     
Here’s who was part of the prisoner swap:
 
            President Joe Biden posted a video to his X account late Thursday of the Oval Office call between former US Marine Paul Whelan, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and their families, capturing the emotional moment when families first learned there relatives were released from Russian custody in the largest prisoner exchange since the Cold War.  
     
            “They’re on a bus. They’re heading to the airport. Once they get on the plane, we’re going to call them. And you’re going to hear them all,” Biden can be seen telling family members in the Oval Office.
     
            “I’ll tell you what, I’m not as good as your families are feeling. They’re all standing around the Oval Office desk here and we just want to say how overwhelmed we are. You’ve been wrongfully detained for a long time and we’re glad you’re home,” the president told the newly released detainees, before handing the phone over to individual family members to greet their relatives. 
     
            Biden offered a special shoutout to Elizabeth Whelan, who he joked has “lived in the Oval Office.” 
     
            “Paul, it’s incredible, absolutely incredible this moment. And I just want you to know, the whole family is standing by,” she told her brother. 
     
            And Vladimir Kara-Murza, a green-card holder also released in Thursday’s exchange, offered an emotional thank you to the president for negotiating his release.
     
            “No word is strong enough about this, I was sure I was going to die in prison, because I don’t believe what’s happening,” he told the president. “I still think it’s a—I still think I’m sleeping in my prison cell in Omsk instead of hearing your voice. But I just want you to know that you’ve done a wonderful thing by saving so many people. I think there are 16 of us on a plane. Again, I still can’t believe it’s happening. So I just wanted to say that I don’t think that there are many things more important than saving human lives.”  
     
            Press was not invited to capture the moment on camera.

            Former President Donald Trump said the prisoner swap that resulted in Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Whelan and others being released as part of the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since the Cold War was a “win for Putin.”  
     
        “As usual, it was a win for Putin or any other country that deals with us. But we got somebody back. So, I’m never going to be challenging that. It wouldn’t have happened with us, we would have gotten it back,” Trump said in an interview on Fox Business. 
     
 
            He said, “They got a great deal. The Russians made a great deal. I’m not going to be criticizing it, because it’s good to have them home, but they got a phenomenal deal and that sets a very bad precedent. Very, very bad precedent.”
     
            “The deal is very complex, because it just came out. So, nobody understands the deal yet,” Trump said, adding, “And they make it complex so you can’t understand how bad the deal is for us. But we got him back and we could have had him back. We should have had him back a long time ago. It should have never happened. It would have never happened. He shouldn’t have been taken in the first place. And it would have never happened with us if I was president.”
     
            The swap involved 24 detainees and seven countries, and Turkey said it played a mediator role. A host of Russian dissidents were also freed, and Moscow got a convicted Russian assassin who had been jailed in Germany.
     
            In May, former President Donald Trump declared that he was the only person who could obtain the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich from a Russian prison. After President Joe Biden proved the claim wrong on Thursday by securing the release of Gershkovich and others in a multi-country prisoner exchange, Trump posted a series of skeptical questions on social media.
     
            Among other things, Trump wrote: “Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING – and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future. That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse.”
     
Facts First: Trump’s claim that he gave opposing countries “NOTHING” to secure the freedom of American prisoners is false. Though Trump obtained or helped to obtain the release of some Americans held abroad without having to release anyone in return, he also presided over at least four exchanges in which he approved the release of prisoners from US detention in exchange for foreign governments releasing Americans.
 
 
            Biden White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that no money was exchanged and no sanctions were loosened as part of the Thursday deal involving Gershkovich. You can read here about who else was freed in the 24-person swap.
     
            National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby responded to Trump’s criticism on CNN Friday, pointing out that several Americans who were detained in Russia during Trump’s administration, such as Whelan and Trevor Reed, were later freed under Biden. “The previous administration also conducted prisoner exchanges. The previous administration also had to make tough decisions to get Americans home. … That’s what you have to do when you have people in harm’s way over there. You’ve got to make these tough decisions. It’s not easy.”
     
FactCheck.org debunked this Trump claim about his record on securing the release of American prisoners abroad when he previously made it in 2022.

            France welcomed the release of political prisoners in Russia, including Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, according to a statement Friday from the country’s foreign ministry. 
     
        “France shares the emotion of families and allied governments following the liberation of several political prisoners detained in Russia,” the statement read.
     
 
            It also called for the release of those who remain “arbitrarily detained in Russia,” notably French researcher Laurent Vinatier, whose detention was extended by a Moscow court on Wednesday. 
     
            The statement added that France “pays tribute to the women and men who defend freedom of expression and opinion despite the risks involved,” and reiterates France’s “outrage at the death of Alexei Navalny.”
     
            Germany’s government has explained why it took the controversial decision to free Vadim Krasikov, the Russian hitman jailed for murder, in Thursday’s prisoner exchange.
     
            Krasikov, a former high-ranking FSB colonel, was convicted of murdering a former Chechen fighter in a Berlin park in 2019, and was later sentenced to life in a German prison.
     
            In a statement Thursday evening, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said Germany had weighed its “obligation” to keep its citizens safe against the need to help its allies to free “innocent people” detained in Russia, like Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
     
        “The Federal Government did not take this decision lightly. The state’s interest in enforcing the prison sentence of a convicted criminal was offset by the freedom, physical well-being and – in some cases – ultimately the lives of innocent people imprisoned in Russia and those wrongfully imprisoned for political reasons,” Hebestreit said.
     
 
            In a lengthy piece published after Gershkovich was freed, the WSJ reported that the fate of Krasikov was crucial to the deal, and revealed the painstaking efforts to persuade a skeptical German government to agree to release the KGB hitman.
     
            Eventually, the White House agreed to send a formal request to the German government requesting the release of Krasikov as part of the prisoner exchange, a move that gave the German government diplomatic cover, the Journal reported.
     
            A top White House official on Friday rebuked Republican vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, for his comments about the motivation for the historic prisoner swap between the United States and Russia.
     
            The Ohio senator told CNN’s Steve Contorno that he believes President Vladimir Putin agreed to Thursday’s exchange because he was “cleaning house” ahead of a possible Trump administration.
     
        “I don’t know what to say,” White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “There’s absolutely zero evidence at all that this deal was brought about because of some potential fear of who might be the next president. “This deal was brought about because the president had – President Biden had – alliances and partnerships and trust he could build on, particularly with the German chancellor, who had made a brave courageous decision to let Mr. (Vadim) Krasikov go,” a reference to the Russian assassin who was jailed in Germany. “That’s what brought these guys home, was really solid relationships and trust and confidence that the president has built up over years with foreign leaders, and a lot of hard work and some tough decisions by some very strong leaders here in the United States and around the world.”
     
 
            Kirby also responded to former President Donald Trump, who hit the Biden administration for giving too much up in exchange for Thursday’s swap.
     
            “Trevor Reid was taken in the previous administration’s time at office. Mr. Biden got him home. Paul Whelan was taken in the previous administration’s time in office, President Biden got Paul home,” Kirby said. “And I would stress that zero dollars were exchanged in this deal that brought these people home last night, it was all about people to people exchanges. And the last thing I’ll say, Kate, is that the previous administration also conducted prisoner exchanges.”
     
            White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan took a victory lap Friday morning, celebrating the news three Americans arrived home Thursday night after being detained in Russia.
     
        “This was a human victory,” Sullivan told CBS News in an interview. “It was three innocent people coming home to their families reunited with their loved ones, and that’s a magical thing.“But second, it was a victory for our country, because this was the United States of America at its best and working with allies to free our citizens who are unjustly detained abroad and also working to free freedom fighters from Russia – people who have dedicated their lives to democracy and human rights and doing it because we stand for that principle.”
     
 
            Sullivan said Thursday’s prisoner swap, which saw Russia exchange 16 people held in Russian detention, including convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, for eight Russians held by the United States, Norway, Slovenia, and Poland, “says a lot about the different priorities of the United States and our allies on the one hand and Russia on the other hand.”
     
            “These are hard decisions, as the president has said. You have to think hard about who you release in a prisoner exchange, that’s been true for decades,” Sullivan told CBS. “But at the end of the day, the president looked at this deal, and he said what we are getting – the value of human life, the value of putting families back together, the value of standing of freedom of the press, far exceeds what we are giving up by sending a few more criminals back to Russia. So, you make that judgment, you make that determination, and then the president makes the tough call and he’s proud of the call he made here.”
     
            The children of Russian intelligence agents, who were among the detainees released as part of a historic prisoner swap between Russia, the US and other Western nations, only discovered their Russian identity on the plane en route to Moscow, the Kremlin said Friday. 
     
            The boy and girl, whose parents are Russian spies Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva who were living undercover in Slovenia, “found out that they were Russian only when the plane took off from Ankara,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists during a daily call. 
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted them on the tarmac in Spanish as they didn’t speak Russian and didn’t even know who Putin was, Peskov said. 
     
        “When the children came down the plane’s steps – they don’t speak Russian – and Putin greeted them in Spanish, he said ‘Buenas noches,’” Peskov said. “They asked their parents yesterday who it was that was meeting them, they didn’t even know who Putin was.”
     
 
            After coming down the plane’s stairs, Doltseva, holding her tears, hugged Putin, who was standing on the red carpet rolled on the tarmac holding bouquets of flowers. Putin kissed Dultseva on the cheek and shoulder, and gave her and her daughter bouquets. 
     
            Putin briefly hugged Dultsev, too, and then the rest of the released Russians, before the group walked together on the red carpet away from the plane. 
     
Some background: Dultsev and Dultseva, who posed as Argentinians, pleaded guilty to espionage in a court in Ljubljana on Wednesday and were sentenced to serve time in prison. 
     
            While living undercover in Slovenia, Dultsev posed as an IT businessman named Ludvig Gish. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced to more than a year and a half in prison, which the court said was equivalent to time spent. He was set to be deported to Russia and was banned from entering Slovenia for five years.
     
            Dultseva posed as an art dealer and gallery owner and went by the name Maria Rosa Mayer Munos. She was also set to be deported. 
     
            During the call with journalists, Peskov also revealed some additional details of prisoner exchange negotiations between Russia and the United States, saying that they were primarily conducted through the FSB and the CIA.
     
            Asked about other Russians detained abroad, Peskov said that “the fate of all our Russians who are held in custody abroad, in the United States, is a matter of constant concern for all our relevant agencies, which will continue the relevant work.”
     
            In late June, CIA officials held a secret meeting with Russian intelligence officers in an undisclosed Middle Eastern capital city to present a proposal for a possible prisoner swap. It was the latest in a series of offers US officials had made to Russia in a yearslong effort to secure the release of Americans imprisoned in Russia.
     
            But this time, the CIA had something new to offer: Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin who’d been convicted of executing a man in broad daylight in Berlin and was serving a life sentence in a German prison.
     
            The proposal the CIA offered to the Russians that day was the culmination of months of work by US officials to convince the Germans to release Krasikov, who’s seen as having close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
     
            The expansive deal presented that day included trading the Russian assassin for two high-profile Americans jailed in Russia on baseless charges of espionage: former US Marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
     
            The Russian officials took the proposal back to Moscow. In early July, in a phone call with CIA Director Bill Burns, the Russian side indicated to the Americans that they agreed to the deal in principle, but the specifics still needed to be hammered out. Then on July 17, Moscow accepted the terms by transmitting their answer to the CIA, setting the stage for the largest prisoner exchange between the US and Russia since the Cold War, one that involved 24 prisoners and seven countries.
     
            It was a remarkably swift conclusion to years of painstaking negotiations between the US and more than half a dozen countries.  
     
Read CNN’s full timeline of the negotiations.
 
            Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who was detained in Russian prisons for nearly six years, said “thank you to everybody” following his arrival to the United States as a freed man.
     
            While proudly displaying an American flag pin given to him by President Joe Biden, Whelan told media gathered at Kelly Field in Texas that his journey to freedom didn’t feel real at first.
     
            “It didn’t feel real until we were flying over England. I’m a British citizen, Irish citizen, Canadian and American. So as we came over England and I looked down, that’s when it became real,” he said. 
     
            Whelan, along with Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, first landed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, DC, following a multi-nation deal to secure their freedom.
     
            The freed Americans traveled to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas, following their brief stop at Joint Base Andrews. 
     
            Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva are now expected to have a medical evaluation at nearby Brooke Army Medical Center.
     
        “I’m looking forward to seeing my family down here and recuperating from five years, seven months, five days of just absolute nonsense from the Russian government,” Whelan said.
     
 
            Whelan also held up a flag honoring hostages and wrongful detainees.
     
            Paul Whelan recalled his experience in Russian detainment began with a “two-week vacation” before Russian authorities grabbed him and claimed he was a spy and a general with the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
     
        “This is the nonsense narrative they came up with. They wouldn’t let it go,” Whelan said. “This is how Putin runs his government. This is how Putin runs his country,” he continued.
     
 
            Whelan joked, “I’m never going back there again.”
     
            Whelan credited his family’s “harsh words” with the government “having to keep them accountable for taking care of us.”
     
            Whelan also expressed gratitude to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens.
     
            “They worked tirelessly,” Whelan said, adding there were a lot of agencies involved and he was “very appreciative of that.”
     
            Former US Marine Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva have arrived at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas.
     
            Following their arrival, they are expected to be transported to nearby Brooke Army Medical Center for medical evaluation.
     
            The three freed Americans who landed at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, DC, on Thursday evening, are now en route to Texas to undergo medical evaluation.
     
            The plane carrying the freed Americans departed Joint Base Andrews at approximately 1:20 a.m. ET, according to a State Department official.
     
            Former US Marine Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are on board with some of their family members as well as State Department personnel.
     
            The flight is expected to last about three hours and will land in San Antonio, Texas. Following their arrival, the three Americans will be taken to Brooke Army Medical Center to undergo medical evaluation and care, a US official told CNN.
     
            CNN earlier reported the evaluations are typical for wrongfully detained Americans who return home, including Brittney Griner.
     
            At least seven Russian oppositions were released as a part of the historic prisoner exchange on Thursday.
     
            Here’s what we know about some of them:
     
Vadim Krasikov, 58
 
Vadim Konoshchenok, 48:
 
Vladislav Klyushin, 43:

We’ve wrapped up our live coverage. Scroll through the posts below to catch up on all the news from Biden and Zelensky’s appearance during the G7 summit.
 
            The United States and Ukraine signed a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday. The deal lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv — but could also be undone by future US administrations, according to officials familiar with its details.
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine. After signing the agreement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden made remarks and answered questions.
     
Here’s what to know:
 
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that the bilateral security pact that Ukraine and the United States signed on Thursday will serve as a bridge to Kyiv’s attempt to join NATO.
     
        “It states that America supports Ukraine’s future membership in NATO and recognizes that our security agreement is a bridge to Ukraine’s membership in NATO,” Zelensky said at a news conference with US President Joe Biden.
     
 
            “It is very important for all Ukrainians and for all Europeans to know that there will be no security deficit in Europe, which tempts the aggressor to war and makes the future uncertain,” he added.
     
            President Joe Biden said that US air defense system support will continue to focus on Ukraine, and that other countries expecting that same support will have to wait.
     
        “We have acquired commitment from five countries, so far, for Patriot batteries and other air defense systems — as well as we’ve let it be known for those countries that are expecting, from us, air defense systems in the future, that they’re going to have to wait. Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries,” Biden said. 
     
 
Some background: The US-made Patriot air defense system that Biden referenced is among the most complex and prized contributions the country has made to Ukraine’s war efforts.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he has received assurances from Chinese leadership that they will not supply weapons to Russia in their war against Ukraine. 
     
            “I had phone conversation with the leader of China, by phone. He said that he will not sell any weapon to Russia,” Zelensky said.
     
            “We’ll see. … If he is respectable person, he will not. Because he gave me (his) word.”
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the United States and leaders like President Joe Biden have supported Ukraine in its war against Russia because of their countries’ shared values — something he says he thinks will continue as the US heads into a presidential election this fall.
     
            “They work based on the voice of their people and it is impossible without people,” Zelensky, who was speaking Ukrainian, said of US leaders.
     
        “I am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents … and it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity within this or that state — and if the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,” he added, according to a realtime translator.
     
 
            Zelensky and Biden are giving remarks after signing a security agreement between their two countries on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday.
     
            The agreement is an “executive agreement,” making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents.
     
            Former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP frontrunner, previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. “Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him “no longer than one day” to settle the war if elected.
     
            US President Joe Biden reaffirmed his support for his son, Hunter Biden, in the first in-person comments the president has made since his son’s conviction on federal gun charges on Tuesday.
     
        “I’m extremely proud of my son Hunter,” the president said. “He has overcome an addiction. He is one of the brightest, most decent men I know.”
     
 
            Biden said he would not pardon his son, restating a commitment he made last week, before Hunter Biden was convicted.
     
            At the end of the news conference, Biden also responded “no” to a shouted question asking whether he would consider commuting his son’s sentence. Hunter Biden has not yet received his sentence.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky marked what he called a “truly historic day” after signing a bilateral security pact between his country and the United States.
     
            “We have signed the strongest agreement within Ukraine and the US since our independence,” the president said at a news conference with US President Joe Biden. The world leaders are gathered for the G7 summit in Italy.
     
            Zelensky said the agreement benefits everyone because Russia is a “real global threat.”
     
        “This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. This is an agreement on cooperation and thus on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace and therefore it benefits everyone in the world,” Zelensky said.
     
 
            The Ukrainian president thanked Biden and Americans listening at home — comments that come after a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine.
     
            US President Joe Biden on Thursday said the US remains steadfast in its support of Ukraine, as he attends the G7 Summit in Italy seeking to shore up American alliances.
     
            Russia’s war, Biden said after signing a long-term security deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, has been a “test for the world.”
     
        “Would we stand with Ukraine?” Biden said. “Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny?”
     
 
            “The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered that question by saying yes we will. We will say it again … we’re going to stand with Ukraine.”
     
            US President Joe Biden addressed reporters after signing a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine on Thursday.    
     
            During a joint news conference on the sidelines of the G7 summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden said the US and other countries signed security agreements so that Ukraine can defend itself now and deter potential attacks in the future. 
     
        “The United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both, not by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition, expanding intelligence-sharing” and training Ukrainian troops, among other efforts, Biden said.
     
 
            US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are speaking in a joint news conference after signing a bilateral security agreement on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Italy.
     
            The deal lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv but could also be undone by future US administrations, according to senior US officials.
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the Group of Seven countries to draw up a clear plan for Ukraine’s recovery after the war.
     
            “We need a clear plan for the recovery, similar to the Marshall Plan for Europe after the war,” Zelensky said, referencing the historic plan between the US and Europe that helped reconstruct the devastated continent after World War II. 
     
        “Friends, let’s draw up such a recovery plan together and confirm it with a joint G7-plus declaration – a recovery declaration,” he said.
     
 
            The Ukrainian president called on the group to agree on a recovery plan “in time for the NATO summit in Washington,” which will take place in early July.
     
            NATO defense ministers are expected to finalize an agreement Friday that will give the alliance greater control over security assistance and training for Ukraine’s military.
     
            Some officials say the agreement is meant to give Europe greater responsibility over the aid amid uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election this fall.
     
            The possibility that former President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of providing US military support to NATO and Europe, could win the election “is a huge part” of why NATO is moving forward with the consolidation plan, said one official familiar with the discussions. 
     
            It is also a way to give Europe more responsibility over the training and equipping of Ukraine, as the extent of the US’ commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia post-November remains unclear, the official said. 
     
            NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the intent in a news conference Thursday, saying NATO provides “more than 99% of all military support to Ukraine … so it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts.” 
     
        He added, “This will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv, and address both immediate and long-term needs.”
     
 
            CNN previously reported the options around ensuring long-term support for Ukraine, which one senior European diplomat described at the time as “future-proofing.”
     
            The announcement comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends the G7 summit in Italy, where he is expected to sign bilateral security agreements with the US and Japan, and speak alongside Biden soon.
     
            The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US’ long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations.
     
            The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.
     
            But the pledge is expected to be an “executive agreement,” the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents.
     
            Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he’d “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” if Europe didn’t increase its defense funding.
     
            The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine’s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said. An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine’s defense.

            President Joe Biden touted a $60 billion investment by the United States in global infrastructure during a roundtable event at the G7 in Italy on Thursday.  
     
            Appearing alongside the other G7 leaders during a roundtable event, Biden spoke mostly off notecards. The president thanked his Italian host, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in particular.
     
            “All told, I’m proud to announce the United States has mobilized more than $60 billion in investments around the world thus far, that’s double where we were last year,” Biden said.
     
            The initiative was launched during the 2022 G7 summit at Schloss Elmau, Germany – a move to better position the US and its allies to compete with China in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.
     
            Greeting Group of Seven leaders in a sumptuous Puglia resort, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni looked happy and at ease. As she hosts the three-day G7 summit, Meloni has every reason to enjoy the moment. Those shaking her hands, however, face uncertainty or impending elections that could toss them from office completely.
     
            Meloni, whose political roots grew from a fascist-inspired party, has none of those concerns. Her Brothers of Italy party resoundingly won last week’s European parliamentary elections in Italy with 28.8% of the vote. This firm standing is making her political kryptonite right now.
     
            Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen – the first to meet Meloni at the G7 – needs the Italian leader to stay out of her way to secure a second presidency. 
     
            US President Joe Biden ­­– who showed up late and looking a trifle out of sorts – faces a big political challenge in November against expected challenger Donald Trump, whose politics are much closer to Meloni’s than Biden’s. 
     
            British Prime Minster Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party is about to be trounced in UK elections on July 4, and French President Emmanuel Macron has called snap parliamentary elections for June 30, following far-right successes in the European vote. 
     
            Japan’s Fumio Kishida is battling a scandal in his own party. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is unpopular in Canada, which will vote by next year at the latest. And German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who fared badly in the EU poll, will also face elections in 2025.
     
            Meloni may well be greeting a radically different set of G7 leaders the next time they all meet.
     
            The Russian foreign ministry has warned that leaders from the Group of Seven countries will face “painful” retaliatory measures following their decision to loan money to Ukraine using profits from frozen Russian investments.
     
            The agreement to provide Ukraine with $50 billion from Russian assets “will not lead the West to anything good,” Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. 
     
            Zakharova called the agreement an “illegal initiative” that “threatens to completely unbalance the financial system and create cataclysmic crises.”
     
            “There is enough European property and money in Russia … and inevitable retaliatory measures will be extremely painful for Brussels,” she said.
     
More on the agreement: The loan will be drawn from funds frozen by Western leaders in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While just $3 billion in frozen funds is located in US banks, a much larger share, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars, is located in banks in Europe.
     
            Negotiators have focused on a loan amount of about $50 billion.
     
            The loan is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024, which would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. President Joe Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election, and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine.

            US President Joe Biden pushed to keep language about reproductive rights in a G7 leaders statement after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document, according to American officials.
     
            Biden worked with other G7 leaders to ensure abortion and reproductive rights remained in the final statement, according to diplomats familiar with the matter.
     
            “The president felt very strongly that we needed to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women’s health and reproductive rights,” a senior US administration official said, referring to last year’s G7 summit in Japan.
     
            In that document, leaders reiterated their support for “access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.”
     
            It also expressed “strong concern about the rollback of women’s and girls’ rights.”
     
Remember: The G7, or Group of Seven, is made up of allied leaders from some of the world’s largest economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US.
     
            President Joe Biden is leading the world’s richest democracies in sending a beefed-up message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West will not forsake Ukraine despite political shocks casting doubts over its commitment.
     
            Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago.
     
            “We will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,” Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. “Ukraine’s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. … The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.”
     
            Yet Biden’s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president’s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe’s security. And the “autocrats of the world” name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill.

            President Joe Biden is not expected to attend Thursday’s dinner for Group of Seven leaders in Italy, the White House said. 
     
            Asked by reporters about the president’s decision aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president will have a “jam-packed two days” and that reporters should not “read too much” into the president’s choice not to attend.
     
            The president arrived in Italy late Wednesday after an almost eight-hour flight, and this week’s summit comes on the heels of a trip to France last week for the anniversary of D-Day and for a state visit in Paris.
     
            It’s at least the fourth time, per CNN’s count, that the president will skip or leave early from an official dinner with other world leaders. In 2022, the president did not attend the G20 dinner in Bali.
     
            In 2023, the president left early from the G7 dinner in Hiroshima and returned to his hotel to receive a briefing from his debt ceiling negotiation team. The president also skipped a NATO summit dinner in Lithuania in 2023.
     
            Biden, the oldest sitting US president, is 81 years old and has faced questions and criticism over whether he is “too old” to run for reelection.
     
            A 59% majority of Americans see both Biden and former President Donald Trump as too old for another term as president, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released earlier this year.
     
            Group of Seven leaders have reached an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, a senior US administration official confirmed Thursday, as the G7 met in Puglia, Italy.
     
        “There was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,” the senior official said.
     
 
            The official added that it’s “only fair that we close the gap by making Russia pay, not our taxpayers, and we found a way to do so that respects the rule of law in every jurisdiction.”
     
            The agreement is the product of years of negotiation complicated by a patchwork of jurisdictional laws that required the direct involvement of President Joe Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, among other top US officials. 
     
What happens next: The leaders will soon issue a joint communiqué on the decision.
     
            It will take some time before Ukraine begins to receive this money, but the US official said the effort would “move with urgency” and the commitment remains “to be ready to disperse $50 billion this calendar year.”
     
            If the loan is dispersed by the end of 2024, it would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election, and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine.
     
            “The next steps are to enshrine the communiqué commitments with the EU 27, the full membership, then we need to write contracts between the lenders … the recipient, which is Ukraine, and the intermediaries,” the official said.
     
            From there, there will be an agreement on a dispersal schedule.
     
            US President Joe Biden arrived to the G7 Summit in Italy armed with a new set of more than 300 sanctions aimed at further isolating and financially weakening Russia more than two years into its offensive in Ukraine.
     
            The measures, the US Department of Treasury said, are “guided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia,” and mark the latest move to limit the Kremlin’s revenues and hamper Moscow’s ability to source materials for its war.
     
            The sanctions take aim at foreign financial institutions supporting Russia’s war, restrict Russia’s access to certain US software and information technology services, and target over 300 individuals and entities “whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanction,” the department said.
     
            The US and Western allies have levied a series of sanctions against Russia in recent years, but Russia has adapted to them. Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken to gloating about Russia’s resistance to international sanctions, which take time to have an effect.
     
        “Today’s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries. We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia’s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia’s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
     
 
            Among the actions is a step that will authorize Treasury to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions aiding Russia’s military-industrial base. The move threatens sanctions on any financial institution that does business with any previously-sanctioned individual or entity, including Sberbank and VTB bank.
     
            US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will participate in a news conference together today in Italy during the G7 summit, according to US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
     
        “On Thursday, President Biden and President Zelensky will sit down to discuss our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future. And following that meeting, both leaders, President Biden and President Zelensky will participate in a news conference,” Kirby said in a gaggle with reporters ahead of the president’s travel.
     
 
            The president apologized to Zelensky last week during a meeting in France for aid delays from the US, telling the Ukrainian leader: “We’re not going to walk away from you.”
     
            Kirby echoed that sentiment ahead of the president’s travel, saying in part that “we will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine’s fight for freedom.” 
     
            Biden is set to meet with other leaders from G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan – at the summit as well.
     
            The White House also confirmed that Pope Francis will attend a special summit on artificial intelligence as part of the larger G7 summit.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the G7 summit earlier on Thursday and was greeted by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
     
            Ahead of his arrival, Zelensky tweeted about the bilateral security agreements with US and Japan that he is expected to sign. 
     
        “Bilateral security agreements will be signed during meetings with US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida,” Zelensky said.

            Amid the olive trees and swimming pools, the anti-incumbent sentiments coursing through Western democracies are creating extraordinarily high stakes for global geopolitics.
     
            Rarely has the yearly gathering of the world’s leading economies been so overshadowed by the political vulnerabilities of nearly all its members. It raises questions of how effective the “steering committee of the free world,” as US President Joe Biden’s aides have labeled the G7, can actually be amid anger and discontent from their own populations.

Our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war has concluded for today.
 
            President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed recent claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he is no longer Ukraine’s legitimate president in a joint news conference with France’s President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Friday.
     
        “President Zelensky’s legitimacy is recognized by the people of Ukraine only, he is elected by the people of Ukraine. I am very grateful for the support,” he said, referring to himself in the third person. “Our people are free. To be honest, that’s what we are fighting for (freedom). I am grateful for the support. Comrade Putin’s legitimacy is recognized only by comrade Putin himself. Putin elects himself. Russian people are just a decoration, they only have one actor,” Zelensky said, pointing to Putin’s recent win by an overwhelming majority in Russia’s presidential election, the result of which was a foregone conclusion.
     
 
            If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election in Ukraine would have been held in March of 2024 and Zelensky’s first term would have ended in May. Putin’s comments dismissed Ukraine’s Martial Law Act introduced after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 which remains in place and which explicitly bans elections during wartime. 
     
            Zelensky also commented on the upcoming Summit on Peace in Ukraine scheduled for June 15-16 in Switzerland. He called on the world’s leaders to participate in person and show that they “are not afraid” of Russia.
     
        “It is definitely a step toward the end of the war – to show that the whole world is on the side of ending of the war, that the whole world wants it and helps Ukraine as much as possible to bring peace closer. A just peace, it is very important that it must be a just and stable peace, not for an hour, a month or a year, but ideally forever,” the Ukrainian leader said.
     
 
            France will begin training Ukrainian pilots and mechanics on the Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet “in the coming days,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday.
     
            Macron would not give additional details on the number and source of the jets that France plans to send to Ukraine as part of a coalition of partners “out of a concern for efficiency,” he said. The training will take place in France, according to Macron.
     
        “We have always had a way of doing things, giving numbers once the arms are delivered and used, it’s more effective and gives less notice to our enemies,” he added, speaking alongside Ukraine’s president in Paris
     
 
            Pressed for details on whether France will deploy military instructors to Ukraine, he said there were still “no taboos” about doing so. 
     
            “Who would we be to cede to the threats of Russia that will de facto decide that Ukraine has no sovereignty to invite companies or instructors (onto its territory)?” Macron said. 
     
            However, he added that France would send about 20 technical experts from different ministries to Ukraine to help Kyiv’s integration with European Union standards. 
     
            Separately, French-German defense firm KNDS signed two contracts Friday with the Ukrainian government to launch the production of spare parts for French-made CAESAR howitzers and 155mm artillery shells in Ukraine. 
     
            US President Joe Biden made a sweeping pledge for democracy on Friday, against the backdrop of Ukraine’s grinding fight in the face of Russia’s full-scale invasion.
     
            His speech came as Western leaders commemorated the largest operation by Allied forces against Nazi Germany during World War II, drawing parallels between the actions of veterans and Kyiv’s forces on the ground today. 
     
Here are the latest developments:
 
            Russia is not currently supplying weapons to other countries as a retaliatory move to Western weapon deliveries to Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday. But he didn’t rule out sending weapons in the future.
     
        “We are not supplying (weapons) yet, but we reserve the right to do this to those states or even some structures that are experiencing pressure on themselves, including of a military nature, from those countries who supply weapons to Ukraine and call for them to be used against us, against Russian territory,” Putin said. 
     
 
            Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin further justified this stance, questioning, “If they (Western countries) deliver them to a combat zone and call for the use of these weapons, why don’t we have the right to do the same, to respond in a mirror way?”
     
            “I’m also not ready to say that we will do this tomorrow, because any such delivery is associated with a number of circumstances that in one way or another affect certain regions of the world and we must, of course, think about it,” he added.
     
            This statement follows Putin’s earlier warning to Western countries, highlighting the risks of supplying weapons to Ukraine and suggesting such actions could provoke Russia to arm its adversaries.
     
            Ukrainian authorities implemented several measures to reduce electricity consumption, as the country grapples with historic low energy capacity caused by Russian strikes on critical infrastructure.
     
        “To improve the situation in the power system, we are working from two angles at the same time. We are restoring and expanding generation while reducing consumption,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. 
     
 
Limited use of electric trains and air conditioning: Across the country, government and regional administrative offices will halt their use of air conditioning and outdoor lighting at buildings and surrounding areas, according to Shmyhal.
     
            Law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and other government agencies are also encouraged to take similar steps. Local authorities will limit street lighting at night. 
     
            The Ukrainian national railway company Ukrzaliznytsia announced on Thursday it is temporarily changing the schedule of suburban electric trains to save power. Some trains will stop running while others will run less frequently. 
     
By the numbers: Nearly half of Ukraine’s available energy capacity has been damaged or destroyed as a result of Russian attacks, according to the CEO of Ukraine’s power grid operator, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi. The United Nations recorded 24 attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities in May, it said Friday. 
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin said that “all armed conflicts end with certain peace agreements” while speaking at a panel during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. 
     
            The Russian president added that Russia “must seek conditions that would correspond to our interests and would be reliable,” but he did not elaborate on what said condition would be. 
     
            However, he went on to accuse the West of being deceptive in its approach to talks, saying, “they deceive you at every step; they say one thing, do another.”
     
            Putin added that “either on the basis of military defeat, or on the basis of victory, we certainly strive and will achieve victory.” 
     
For context: An international peace summit on Ukraine is scheduled to be held in Switzerland next weekend. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia — with China’s help — last week of attempting to pressure countries not to join the upcoming summit. 
     
            Reuters reported in late May that Moscow was willing to consider peace talks that would freeze the current Russian occupation of about a fifth of Ukraine. Putin responded to that report by suggesting Russia was willing to talk peace, based on earlier agreements. He hinted at an aborted deal in Istanbul, just after the war began in 2022, which fell apart, mostly because Moscow’s forces were still rampaging across Ukrainian territory and massacres around Kyiv had come to light. CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh outlines two reasons why Putin may be talking about peace again.
     
            Even though Russia has “many more” nuclear bombs than the US and Europe, discussions about a possible nuclear war are not necessary, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Friday. 
     
            “There is no need to think about it [nuclear war]. And I would ask anyone to not mention anything like that,” he said at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. 
     
            Putin added that Russian forces are “increasing their effectiveness,” about 27 months into Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s defense industry has increased shell production by 20%, and its forces are “surpassing the capabilities of our enemies” when it comes to aircraft and tanks, he said.
     
Veiled threats: Putin has repeatedly made remarks on the possibility of using nuclear weapons. On Friday, the Russian leader said his country has nuclear weapons that are more powerful than the bombs the Americans dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, “but it won’t come to this.” Russia’s total nuclear stockpile is larger than the United States’, at around 6,250 total nuclear warheads, according to the Arms Control Association. The US has more than 5,500.
     
Legacy of nuclear war: Washington unleashed atomic bombs on both Japanese cities in August 1945, leaving years of destruction and psychological trauma on communities there.
     
            At least 70,000 people were killed in the initial blast in Hiroshima, while approximately 70,000 more died from radiation exposure. The US dropped another bomb on Nagasaki three days later killing up to 80,000 people. 
     
            The US remains the only country to ever use an atomic bomb in war.
     
            During a speech commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day at Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France, US President Joe Biden honored and thanked veterans for their service, while stressing the importance of democracy and issuing a warning against a rising tide of isolationism. 
     
        “When we talk about democracy — American democracy — we often talk about the ideals of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. What we don’t talk about is how hard it is,” Biden said. 
     
 
            Here are highlights from his speech: 
     
            Private First Class John Wardell, born July 1925, came ashore in Normandy on June 16, 1944, shortly after the D-Day invasion. He was just 18.
     
            Wardell served with rangers in the Battle of Brest and was wounded in Germany during the latter stages of the war, the White House said.
     
            In his speech at Pointe du Hoc, US President Joe Biden paid tribute to Wardell, from New Jersey, who was sat in the audience next to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
     
        “John, we love you, man. Thank you for all you’ve done,” Biden said, as the audience applauded. “You deserve that and a lot more, John.”
     
 
            In his closing remarks, US President Joe Biden described his country as “the fortunate heirs of the legacy” of the veterans who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc on D-Day, and vowed to continue their mission.
     
        “My fellow Americans, I refuse to believe — I simply refuse to believe — that America’s greatness is a thing of the past. I still believe there’s nothing beyond our capacity in America when we act together,” Biden said.
     
 
            The line was an indirect shot at Biden’s political rival, former President Donald Trump, whose signature slogan — “Make America Great Again” — and campaign speeches often imply that the country’s best days are behind it and carry the vision of a dark future.
     
            Biden said the veterans are “not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.”
     
        “They’re not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us to care for others and our country more than ourselves. They’re not asking us to do their job, they’re asking us to do our job: to protect freedom in our time. To defend democracy. To stand up to aggression abroad and at home,” he said.
     
 
            US President Joe Biden issued a sharp warning against a rising tide of isolationism in the US, during his speech at Pointe du Hoc.
     
        “We talk about democracy, American democracy. We often talk about the ideals of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. What we don’t talk about is how hard it is,” Biden said, claiming the “most natural instinct is to walk away.”
     
 
            But, pointing to the example of D-Day veterans in the audience, he warned against this instinct.
     
            “They believed America was the beacon of the world. I’m certain they believed that it would be that way forever,” he said.
     
        “Ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things when challenged. There’s no better example of that in the whole world than right here at Pointe du Hoc.”
     
 
            US President Joe Biden suggested that American WW2 veterans would want their country to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression today, just as they opposed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s aggression.
     
            When the Allied forces arrived on the Normandy beaches on D-Day, Biden said a “feared dictator” who had “conquered a continent had finally met his match.”
     
            “Because of them, the war turned. They stood against Hitler’s aggression. Does anyone doubt – does anyone doubt, that they would want America to stand up against Putin’s aggression here in Europe today?” he said.
     
            He asked if anyone thought those Rangers would want America to “go it alone” today.
     
            “They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ’30s and ‘40s. Does anyone believe they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish the hateful ideologies of today?” Biden said.
     
            Throughout the D-Day commemoration events, Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders have drawn parallels between the fight against fascism in the 1930s and the fight against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine today.
     
            US President Joe Biden began his speech by painting a picture in remembrance of the attack of Pointe du Hoc after taking in the site on the 80-year D-Day anniversary in Normandy.
     
            The site of the speech is the scene of one of the most heroic actions on June 6, 1944, as Army Rangers scaled 100-foot cliffs to attack Nazi positions.
     
        “All they could hear was a crack of bullets hitting ships, sand, rocks, hitting everything. All they knew was time was of the essence. They had only 30 minutes. Thirty minutes to eliminate the Nazi guns, high on this cliff – guns that could halt the allied invasion before it even began. But these are American rangers. They were ready,” Biden said. 
     
 
            The White House released excerpts ahead of US President Joe Biden’s expected speech in Normandy, where he is expected to speak on democracy as he marks the 80th anniversary of D-Day at Pointe du Hoc.
     
            “I’ve long said that history has shown that ordinary Americans can do the most extraordinary things. And there’s no better example of that in the entire world than right here at Pointe du Hoc,” an excerpt reads. 
     
            The excerpts show Biden will use the iconic Pointe-du-Hoc site to call on Americans to protect US democracy.
     
        “As we gather here today, it’s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day June 6, 1944. It’s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us. They’re asking us what will we do. They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs. They’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.”
     
 
            Ukraine has documented its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost one year, amid Russia’s sweeping offensive on the northeastern region of Kharkiv.
     
            The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a “significant increase” — at least 31% — in the number of civilians killed in Ukraine in May, compared to April, according to a press release. 
     
Kharkiv offensive: More than half of deaths in May took place in Kharkiv city and the wider region, said the head of HRMMU, Danielle Bell, where Russian forces launched a renewed ground attack on May 10.
     
            Bell attributed the increase of casualties to Russia’s use of “air-dropped bombs and missiles” in populated areas near the frontline and Kharkiv city.
     
            The scale and force of Russia’s assault on Kharkiv prompted the US to allow Kyiv to strike from Kharkiv across the border into Russia, using allied-made weapons.
     
Recent attacks: In the update, the UN monitoring mission highlighted some recent attacks on the Kharkiv area; an attack on a printing house in Kharkiv city on May 21 which killed at least civilians; and a strike on a large home improvement center in Kharkiv city on May 25 that killed 19 civilians. 
     
        Such attacks “highlight the stark vulnerability of civilians engaged in everyday activities, where even routine tasks like buying supplies to repair damaged homes can result in the loss of life and loved ones,” Bell remarked. 
     
 
            US President Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive at Pointe du Hoc, in Normandy in minutes, as Western leaders mark the anniversary of the largest Allied forces’ operation against Nazi Germany in World War II. 
     
        The US leader will draw parallels between the more than 150,000 allies troops who fought for the liberation of Europe from Adolf Hitler’s Nazis on June 6, 1944, and Ukraine’s present fight against Russia’s raging 27-month invasion.
     
 
            “He’ll talk about the stakes of that moment – an existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,” national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters. The speech will attest to the urgency of democracy, invoking the symbolism of the location.
     
            Biden will echo one of his predecessors, Ronald Reagan, who in 1984 traveled to a clifftop 100 feet high known as Pointe du Hoc, which was scaled in a daring raid by US Army Rangers on D-Day. Despite heavy losses, the Rangers seized German artillery pieces that could have caused even greater carnage of the Omaha and Utah invasion beaches.
     
            Reagan stood in front of a stone memorial shaped into the Rangers’ emblem, with his back to the Channel, surrounded by surviving veterans of the raid, and gave one of the greatest presidential speeches. “These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,” Reagan said. He later confessed to his diary that he was so moved it was tough to get the words out.

            US President Joe Biden has apologized to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky for the delay earlier this year in passing a new military aid package, which was held up by Republican opposition in Congress.
     
            Biden made the apology while announcing a new aid package for Ukraine in a bilateral meeting with Zelensky on Friday.
     
            “You know, you haven’t bowed down, you haven’t yielded at all, you continue to fight in a way that is just remarkable, is just remarkable—and we’re not going to walk away from you,” Biden told the Ukrainian president. 
     
        “I apologize for the weeks of not knowing what’s going to pass, in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up, but we got it done.”
     
 
            Biden took the opportunity to tout Friday’s funding announcement, as well as the additional funding surged to Ukraine since he signed the supplemental in April.
     
            “Since then, including today, I’ve announced six packages of significant funding—today I’m also signing an additional package for $225 million to help you reconstruct the electric grid,” he said.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of the return of fascism in Europe, 80 years after D-Day, the Allied invasion of France which laid the foundations for the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.
     
        “Unfortunately, we live in a time when Europe is no longer a continent of peace. And at a time when Nazism is unfortunately making a comeback,” Zelensky told the French National Assembly in Paris Friday.
     
 
            Zelensky had joined other world leaders and veterans in marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, northwest France, on Thursday, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rages on.
     
        “Once again in Europe, cities are being completely destroyed and villages are being burnt down. Once again in Europe, filtration and deportation camps are appearing, and hatred, which has become a new Russian cult,” Zelensky told French lawmakers Friday.
     
 
            Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted incredulity and further derailed his floundering general election campaign.
     
            Sunak attended the first part of the commemorative events in Normandy, France, on Thursday, but skipped the international ceremony at Omaha Beach, which was attended by other world leaders and veterans of the Allied operation in 1944.
     
            The UK was represented at the international ceremony by David Cameron, Sunak’s foreign secretary and a former prime minister, who took photographs alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden.
     
            Also in attendance was Labour leader Keir Starmer, who was filmed speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the event. Labour was quick to condemn Sunak’s decision to skip the events, and the gaffe dominated British news coverage of the election on Friday.
     
            Large swaths of Ukraine are facing rolling and emergency blackouts as the country grapples with historic low energy capacity due to Russian strikes targeting critical infrastructure.
     
            Nearly half of Ukraine’s available capacity has been damaged or destroyed, according to Ukrainian power grid operator Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.
     
        “We are dealing with an absolutely unprecedented scale of destruction. And the deficits that we have in the power system now, which are not even covered by the fairly powerful imports that come from Europe to Ukraine, are precisely the result of this destruction,” Kudrytskyi told local media.
     
 
            The destruction means Ukraine is facing a historic low energy generation capacity, he said, and announced electricity consumption limits in all regions of Ukraine.
     
        “The main reason for the restrictions is the consequences of six enemy missile attacks on Ukrainian power plants. Due to significant damage, they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attacks,” he explained.
     
 
            Ukraine has imported energy from neighboring Poland, Romania and Moldova. It has also received emergency assistance from Poland, but Kudrytskyi warned these measures are insufficient.
     
            The United Nations has recorded 24 attacks on energy facilities during the month of May, it said Friday. 
     
            Ukrainian energy authorities have now been forced to carry out blackouts “compounding the difficulties faced by millions of Ukrainians who have now lived through almost 28 months of war,” the UN said.

This post has been updated with the UN’s statement. 
 
            US President Joe Biden is set to present a case for democracy Friday against the backdrop of a key turning point for allied forces in World War II – setting up a dramatic moment with war once more on Europe’s doorstep and teeing up a domestic contrast with his political rival.
     
            Biden will travel to Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France, on Friday – a site separating the Omaha and Utah beaches where American Army Rangers scaled steep cliffs to secure positions against the Germans – for a speech on the power of democracy invoking the symbolism of the location.
     
            The speech will stand out as a call to modern-day action against an isolationist streak seeping into American politics and a rise of authoritarianism around the world.
     
            Eighty years after the allied landings, the president will draw a “throughline” from World War II to today in his remarks, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. But the subtext of the speech is also likely to be aimed at former President Donald Trump.
     
        “He’ll talk about the stakes of that moment – an existential fight between dictatorship and freedom. He’ll talk about the men who scaled those cliffs and how they… put the country ahead of themselves. And he’ll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how if we back dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going, and ultimately, America and the world pays a greater price,” Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky drew parallels between World War II and his country’s battle against Russia in an address to French lawmakers in Paris Friday.  
     
        “Hitler crossed red line after red line, Putin does the same,” he said, adding that Ukrainians were the heirs of the Allied fighters of WW2.
     
 
            His speech was greeted rapturously by the French National Assembly, with lawmakers giving him a standing ovation. In the opening months of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Zelensky addressed the French National Assembly by video.
     
        “France, I thank you for being at our side to defend life,” he said in French.
     
 
            On Thursday, Macron announced that Paris and Kyiv will sign an agreement for France to provide Ukraine with Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets.
     
            Following Thursday’s D-Day commemorations, French President Emmanuel Macron said France will begin supplying Ukraine with Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets.
     
            The delivery program will begin following the signing of an agreement with Ukraine’s president on Friday in Paris, Macron said in an interview with French broadcaster TF1.
     
            The Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet is a multirole jet that been in service for some 25 years, with air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities. The Mirage jet has been successfully exported by France to several countries and broadly offers a similar capacity to the American-made F-16 jet.
     
            Macron said that he proposed to begin training pilots on the aircraft from this summer, with training taking around 6 months. France is already providing basic flight training to Ukrainian pilots as part of the F-16 supply program.
     
            The French leader said that he hoped to build a similar coalition of countries that could provide Ukraine with their own Mirage jets. Both Greece and the UAE have Mirage 2000-5 jets in their air forces.
     
            Russia attacked Ukraine’s critical infrastructure overnight into Friday, targeting at least nine regions including the capital Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said. 
     
            Ukraine’s air defenses shot down 48 out of 53 attack drones launched by Russia and all five cruise missiles launched, Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram. 
     
            They were shot down in the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kyiv and Khmelnytskyi regions, he said.
     
            At least one person died and four injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region; four others were injured in the Kherson region and six others in Dnipropetrovsk, local officials said.
     
            In Kyiv region, a fire broke out at an industrial facility, but there were no casualties and responders are working to try to extinguish the fire, the head of Kyiv region military administration said.
     
            US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky are in France as part of the commemorations for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. 
     
            Biden and Zelensky were among a throng of Western leaders and veterans who attended the commemorations in Normandy on Thursday, but Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited.
     
            Instead, Putin will on Friday speak at the plenary session of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, discussing the state of the Russian economy after 27 months of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
     
            Meanwhile, Zelensky will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and address the National Assembly in Paris, as he seeks to shore up support for his country in its attempts to repel Russia’s invasion.
     
            The war may have entered a new phase this month, after Western countries – including the United States – gave Ukraine permission to use Western weapons to strike inside Russian territory.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping sought to deepen ties across energy, trade and security on Thursday, against a backdrop of political unrest.
     
            Both leaders made specific references to the war in Ukraine, sovereignty in Taiwan and fighting in the Middle East, during Putin’s two-day state visit to Beijing.
     
Here are the latest developments:
 
            Chinese President Xi Jinping had an in-depth exchange of views Thursday on the war in Ukraine with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, according to a statement from China’s foreign ministry. 
     
            During the meeting in Beijing, Xi conveyed China’s support for convening an international peace conference to settle the “Ukraine crisis” and reiterated China’s commitment to continue to play a constructive role in an early political settlement, according to the statement. 
     
            Putin said he welcomed China’s stance on Ukraine and said Moscow would further ensure a consensus is reached between both sides.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would “very much like China to be involved” in Ukraine’s peace plan. 
     
            The Ukrainian peace summit is set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
            Russia has not been represented in any of the four closed-door international peace talks so far and will not be participating this year. China has only attended one hosted by its increasingly close strategic partner, Saudi Arabia.
     
            NATO believes Russian troops don’t have the numbers necessary for a “strategic” breakthrough in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, a senior commander of the military alliance said on Thursday, though he acknowledged that Moscow’s forces have made “local advances.”
     
            Responding to a question about Russian troops pushing deeper into the northeastern region, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told a press conference in Brussels that “(Russians) don’t have the skill and the capability to do it, to operate at the scale necessary to exploit any breakthrough to strategic advantage.”
     
            NATO’s assessment comes after Russian forces took control of several villages close to the border since launching a surprise attack on May 10. 
     
        (Russians) do have the ability to make local advances, and they have done some of that. They have also made some local losses, so I am in very close contact with our Ukrainian colleagues, and I am confident that (Ukraine) will hold the line,” NATO’s Cavoli said.
     
 
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with senior military officials in Kharkiv earlier on Thursday. He described an “extremely difficult” outlook for Kyiv’s troops on the ground, where “we are strengthening our units.” 
     
            Ukraine’s Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn warned combat in the Kharkiv direction “remains complicated and is changing dynamically.”
     
            On the third Thursday of every May, Ukrainians across the globe celebrate the vyshyvanka, a traditional embroidered shirt. 
     
            Yet the stitched panelling of a vyshyvanka extends beyond the garment itself. For many Ukrainians, each star or flower design is a symbolic expression of their right to self-determination.
     
            “I think that vyshyvanka is a very vivid symbol that speaks for itself. Wearing vyshyvanka is very easy to show your identity, your position, your belonging to a certain group,” said Natalia Kamenska, co-founder of the Ukrainian brand Gunja Project. “It is a way of saying ‘We are Ukrainians.’”
     
            Ukrainians mark Vyshyvanka Day by wearing the traditional dress. Kamenska, a designer, told CNN the shirt helps Ukrainian people form a sense of belonging in the face of colossal grief and uncertainty.
     
        “All Ukrainians have been thinking about who we are and how important it is to defend our land, our right to exist on this land, and our independence,” she told CNN. “A lot of people wear vyshyvankas. More and more people have become interested in the history of their family and their country.
     
 
            Kamenska described the war in Ukraine as “a tumultuous time” for her compatriots.
     
            “With families being separated, people fleeing their homeland, people have a sense of constant anxiety from not knowing what will happen tomorrow,” she added. “For many people, vyshyvanka is a thing that reminds them of the importance of everything that is happening now.”
     
            The Russian military is not allowing civilians to evacuate from the town of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukraine’s interior minister on Thursday. Ihor Klymenko said that National Police investigators in the region have launched a criminal investigation “into the violation of the rules and customs of war.” 
     
            CNN is unable to independently verify Klymenko’s claims and has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry for comment. 
     
            Klymenko said the police evacuation teams continue to work in Vovchansk “despite intense fighting and are trying to ensure further evacuation of people.” 
     
            Oleksii Kharkivskyi, the chief patrol officer of the Vovchansk Police Department, posted on Facebook on Thursday that evacuations are still underway and that “staying in the town is dangerous.” 
     
            The head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, also said Thursday that evacuations continue but claims Russian forces have used cluster munitions to attack a village in the Vovchansk area, injuring five people.
     
Some context: The town of Vovchansk, located about 60 km (or about 37 miles) northeast of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, has been the scene of some of the most intense battles in areas near the border in recent days as Russia continues efforts to push deeper into Ukrainian territory.
     
            Every year, on the third Thursday of May, Ukrainians worldwide celebrate Vyshyvanka Day. 
     
            This holiday is dedicated to preserving Ukraine’s famous embroidered shirt, known as a “vyshyvanka,” as a symbol of its people’s material and spiritual heritage. 
     
            Ukrainian embroidery varies in its techniques, and different regions across the country produce their own patterns. Traditionally, each stitch, star or flower has a particular meaning.
     
            In the past, many Ukrainians saw the embroidery as a protective talisman and it represents happiness, fate, life and victory. 
     
        Nowadays, Ukrainians also wear the vyshyvanka as a challenge to Russia, as a display of their national identity and to celebrate the long history of Ukraine.
     
 Today is Vyshyvanka Day, celebrating the traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt.Visible or invisible, it is always under a defender's pixel, a rescuer's uniform, a medic's coat, a power engineer's jacket, a volunteer, a teacher, or anyone who holds the defense.Our children… pic.twitter.com/0hlfnrwo5M 
            Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to strengthen ties across energy, trade, security and geopolitics on Thursday, as both parties displayed their close relationship against the backdrop of regional unrest.
     
            Both leaders shared their vision in a statement released by the Kremlin after a meeting in Beijing, with specific references to the war in Ukraine, sovereignty in Taiwan and fighting in the Middle East. 
     
        “In conditions of international turbulence, Russian-Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,” according to the statement.
     
 
            Putin and Xi said they would “deepen trust” and military “cooperation” by expanding dual exercises and combat training, regularly holding joint sea and air patrols and improving the “level of joint response to challenges and threats.”
     
            The two countries also expressed “very deep concern” over what they described as “extremely destabilizing” US military activity with allies “that have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation.”
     
            Referencing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia said it welcomes the readiness of China “to play a constructive role” in the political and diplomatic settlement of the war.
     
            “It is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,” the statement said. “There can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be fought.”
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with senior military officials in the city of Kharkiv on Thursday, as Russian forces push deeper into the northeastern region. 
     
            The Ukrainian leader described an “extremely difficult” outlook for Kyiv’s troops on the ground, where “we are strengthening our units.” He also met with the senior officials from other border and frontline regions.
     
            Efforts to bolster Ukrainian forces were concentrated in Lyptsi and Vovchansk; a town located about 60 km (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv city and the site of some of the most intense battles near the border. 
     
            At the same time, Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn warned combat in the Kharkiv direction “remains complicated and is changing dynamically.” 
     
            “Our forces are preventing the occupiers from gaining a foothold in certain areas in the northern Kharkiv region,” Voloshyn said in a television interview. 
     
        “The enemy’s advance in certain settlements has been stopped. However, the enemy is trying to ensure conditions for further advancement in order to take advantageous positions,” Voloshyn added. 
     
 
            Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages close to the border since they launched a surprise attack on May 10. 
     
            American soldier Gordon Black, who was arrested in Russia on suspicion of theft, has “admitted guilt” and is cooperating with the investigation, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday quoting law enforcement agencies. 
     
            “The accused admitted guilt and is cooperating with the investigation. This happens in English through an interpreter,” a law enforcement representative told TASS.
     
            Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was arrested in Vladivostok on May 2. He is accused of “committing secret theft” of property and causing “significant damage,” the Pervomaisky District Court of Vladivostok said. 
     
            Black remains in pre-trial detention as authorities assess whether he has been provided everything he needs, including access to a lawyer, the chairman of the regional Public Monitoring Commission (ONC) Vladimir Naidin told TASS.
     
            Black was stationed in South Korea and after completing his service, went to Vladivostok to visit a Russian woman with whom he had a romantic relationship, according to TASS. He was arrested at a time of elevated tensions between the US and Russia as the war in Ukraine grinds on. However, a Russian Foreign Ministry representative told TASS that the case is “not related to politics or espionage.”
     
            At the time of his arrest, the US State Department confirmed that a US citizen was detained in Russia. “We have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas,” a State department spokesperson said at the time. Several other Americans are also being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department – Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan.
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin said he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening.
     
            The talks are expected to include Russia’s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia’s Security Council.
     
            Putin replaced close ally Shoigu as defense minister with Belousov in a major reshuffle of military leadership earlier this week. 
     
            The shake-up comes off the back of significant advances by Russian troops in Ukraine’s east. With defense spending soaring, Belousov’s appointment suggests Russia’s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have pledged to deepen their partnership in Beijing in a stark show of their growing alignment as Russian troops advance in Ukraine.
     
            Xi hailed the two countries’ deepening ties, which were formalized in a joint statement inked by the leaders in a ceremony Thursday, saying they would “inject strong momentum” in the development of their relations.
     
            Putin – whose delegation includes top defense and security officials – was welcomed by Xi to Beijing’s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of his for the start of his two-day state visit.
     
            China is Russia’s main trading partner, and international sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine have driven the two economies closer. 
     
            In meetings with Putin, Xi proclaimed that China-Russian relations have “stood the test of a changing international landscape” and “have been moving forward steadily with enhanced comprehensive strategic coordination,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.
     
        “This has made positive contributions to maintaining global strategic stability and promoting greater democracy in international relations,” it said.

            Following talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Thursday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said “both sides agree that political resolution to the Ukraine issue is the right direction.”
     
        “China’s position on this issue has been consistent and clear, which includes adherence to the UN charter and principles, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country, respect for the legitimate security concerns of each party, and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework,” Xi said. 
     
 
        “China hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role.”
     
 
            Xi lamented that a “cold-war mentality continues to linger” and “unilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country.”
     
Some background: China has repeatedly defended its trade with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace. During meetings with European leaders last week, Xi pushed back against allegations of his country’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.
     
            Ukrainian band 19.99, who played a rendition of Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” with Antony Blinken in Kyiv on Tuesday, said it was a “surreal situation” but they believe it sent an “important message.”
     
            The US Secretary of State made the surprise appearance on stage in a bar in Kyiv as part of his visit to the Ukrainian capital, where he also met President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss battlefield updates and the importance of US aid. 
     
            Dmitry Temnyi, lead singer of 19.99, told CNN’s Rosemary Church on Thursday that it was like a “fairytale” and praised Blinken as a “very good guitarist.”
     
        “Now it’s just every day a struggle for our country and our culture… You need to keep going on, keep moving, do something to support our own family, our own people,” he said. 
     
 
            Drummer Mykyta Kovtunenko said the concert sent an “important message for support in these hard times” to all those watching on TV or online. 
     
        “It was very powerful.”
     
 
            Blinken’s appearance at Barman Dictat — a popular underground cocktail bar and music venue just off Kyiv’s main street, Khreshchatyk — was kept a secret from the band until the last minute. 
     
            The group thought they might be playing with Neil Young as they had been asked to prepare his 1989 hit. 
     
            Guitarist Arsen Gorbach said they had received a message saying that “there won’t be Neil Young, there would be one VIP guest.”
     
        “We were like, wow, interesting, who? And they texted us about Antony Blinken and we like ‘what a surrealistic situation’.”
     
 
            In a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Vladimir Putin hailed China as Russia’s main trading partner, as international sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine drive the two economies closer. 
     
            During his state visit to Beijing on Thursday, Putin said China and Russia have “accumulated a solid baggage of practical cooperation” and identified energy, industry, and agriculture among his priorities, Russian state news agency TASS reported.
     
            In turn, Xi said China is willing to always be Russia’s “good neighbor, friend and partner” and will work together “to consolidate the lasting friendship between the two peoples”  as well as “uphold fairness and justice in the world.”
     
Record trade: Russia’s war in Ukraine has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together — with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel.
     
Sanctions prompt trade shift: The European Union, the US and other nations have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications.
     
            The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with — and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline. The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade, hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule — a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Beijing for the start of a two-day state visit underlining close alignment with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as Russian troops advance in Ukraine.
     
            The visit — Putin’s symbolic first overseas foray since entering a new term as Russia’s president last week – is the latest sign of deepening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy frictions with the West.
     
            This is the fourth in-person meeting between Xi and Putin since Russia’s invasion and Putin’s second visit to Beijing in that time.
     
            Russian troops have been pushing into northeastern Ukraine since their surprise assault on May 10 in the border region of Kharkiv. Their advances in the region are Moscow’s most significant since Ukrainian forces recaptured Kharkiv in 2022.
     
            Here are more of the latest headlines: 
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping rolled out a red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin as the two leaders met in Beijing on Thursday, heralding the start of a two-day state visit. 
     
            Putin was welcomed to the Chinese capital by a military band serenade and multiple-gun salute outside the Great Hall of the People. 
     
            The meeting in Beijing – Putin and Xi’s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 – comes as international concern about the direction of the war mounts.
     
            Xi welcomes Putin under pressure from both the US and Europe to ensure soaring exports from China to Russia since aren’t propping up the Kremlin’s war effort.
     
            White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support – in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines, and microelectronics – from China for Russia’s defense industrial base. 
     
            Beijing has slammed the US as making “groundless accusations” over “normal trade and economic exchanges” between China and Russia.

            As countries around the world ramped up sanctions on Russia in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin still had a powerful friend in Xi Jinping.
     
            This week, Xi is welcoming Putin to China for a two-day state visit — their fourth in-person meeting since Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine began.
     
            The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together — with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel.
     
            The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases in related goods that are consistent with those claims.
     
Sanctions drive economies closer: The European Union, the US and others across the world have imposed sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country.  
     
            Despite these efforts to isolate Putin’s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia’s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.  
     
            China has emerged as a key economic lifeline and is now Russia’s top trade partner.
     
Governments warn against support for Russia’s war effort: White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing’s substantial support for Russia’s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Beijing for the start of a two-day state visit to China, underlining his close alignment with leader Xi Jinping as Russian troops make significant advances in Ukraine.
     
            The visit — Putin’s symbolic first overseas foray since entering a new term as Russia’s president last week – is a mark of Xi’s support for Putin.
     
            Putin landed in the Chinese capital early Thursday morning, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that he would halt all upcoming international visits as his troops defend a surprise Russian offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region.
     
            The meeting in Beijing comes as Russia’s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions.
     
            Ahead of the trip, Putin hailed the “unprecedented level of strategic partnership” between the countries in an interview with Chinese state media Xinhua.
     
        He said the leaders aimed to “strengthen foreign policy coordination” and deepen cooperation in “industry and high-tech, outer space and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and other innovative sectors.”
     
 
            He also praised China’s “approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine.” 
     
            Beijing has never condemned Russia’s invasion. It claims neutrality in the conflict and has called for peace talks that take both sides’ positions into account.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his defense and security forces managed “to partially stabilize the situation” in the northern Kharkiv region, where Russian troops are making advances.
     
            Zelensky said Wednesday night that Ukrainian forces continue defensive actions in areas near the Russian border and in Vovchansk, which is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. 
     
            The border town of Vovchansk was liberated from Russian occupation more than 18 months ago when Ukraine recaptured Kharkiv.
     
            Zelensky said his troops were using artillery, drones, and infantry to stop the advance of Russian troops.
     
            He said all other areas of the Ukrainian frontline are treated with “the same attention” as the Kharkiv region and that Russia’s onslaught will not lead to defensive gaps elsewhere along the frontline.
     
        “We clearly see how the occupier is trying to distract our forces and make our combat work less concentrated. We are reacting to this exactly as we should — we must have the means to retaliate against the enemy in every direction.”
     
 
            Ukraine’s army echoed Zelensky’s words, saying that troops “continue to carry out defense and stabilization measures in Vovchansk and are keeping the situation under control there.”
     
            Russia launched a surprise cross-border assault on May 10, targeting the Kharkiv region.
     
            Ukrainian officials on Wednesday called the town of Vovchansk an epicenter of fierce battles. Russia has already taken control of more than nine villages near the border in recent days.
     
            Russia has stepped up its disinformation efforts to discredit Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and raise questions about his legitimacy in recent months, US intelligence agencies have observed.
     
            A recently downgraded intelligence assessment shared with CNN says that Russia has seized on various recent events to fuel criticism about Zelensky’s abilities and place as Ukraine’s leader, a senior Biden administration official said in an interview.
     
            Russia has spread disinformation about Zelensky since before the war started, but recent intelligence shows “it’s definitely increasing,” the official said.
     
            Russia has highlighted two main areas in this recent disinformation push, the intelligence indicates: Ukraine’s painful withdrawal from the eastern city of Avdiivka, and the fact that Ukraine postponed its presidential election scheduled for this Spring due to the war.
     
Wider impacts: The US is more concerned about the impact of the disinformation on countries abroad than on Ukrainians’ confidence in Zelensky, the official said.
     
        “That’s why we’re briefing our allies and partners about this,” the official said. “We want to make sure that this type of Russian disinformation doesn’t take hold and other countries that might not realize, ‘Oh, of course, they can’t hold elections because they’re in a state of martial law as a consequence of Russia’s war.’”

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US remains “committed” to helping Ukraine win the war against Russia, but it is not encouraging strikes on Russian territory. 
     
        “We’ve not encouraged or enabled strikes outside Ukraine but ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it’s going to conduct this war, a war it’s conducting in defense of its freedom, of its sovereignty, of its territorial integrity and we’ll continue to back Ukraine with the equipment it needs to succeed,” Blinken said on Wednesday in Kyiv. 
     
 
            Blinken also announced that the US will provide $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine, saying “we put this together in a first-of-its-kind defense enterprise fund.”
     
            The fund will have three components, Blinken said, including: 
     
        “Of course, everyone’s eyes are focused on the situation in the east and northeast, Kharkiv in particular. And so the newest support that I just announced, but particularly the $60 billion supplemental, we know is coming at a critical time,” Blinken said.  
     
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday the provision of $2 billion in military financing for Ukraine, and said much-needed weapons and ammunition are being rushed to the front lines. 
     
            “Ukraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught,” Blinken said during a news conference in Kyiv, speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba
     
            He said he discussed weapons deliveries with Kuleba and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
     
        “We are rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses. Rushing them to get to the front lines to protect soldiers, to protect civilians,” Blinken said, pointing out that air defenses are “a top priority.”
     
 
Some background: The US State Department acknowledged that the $2 billion in foreign military financing is coming primarily from the recently passed Ukraine Security supplemental, and $400 million of it is coming from existing Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that had not previously been allocated to Ukraine.
     
            Blinken also said Washington strongly supports a Ukrainian peace summit set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
            At least 1,993 children in Ukraine have been killed or wounded since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to the United Nation’s children’s agency (UNICEF).
     
            On average, at least two children die in Ukraine every day, UNICEF reported on Tuesday. 
     
        “Ukraine’s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services, and psychosocial support,” the agency said in a statement. “More than anything, Ukraine’s children need peace.”
     
 
Mental health impact: The war in Ukraine has “harmfully affected” the mental health and well-being of children, UNICEF said, adding that half of teenagers report trouble sleeping. At least one in five suffer intrusive thoughts and flashbacks.
     
Loss of education: Almost half of children enrolled in school in Ukraine have been robbed of in-person education, according to the report. Nearly one million children across the country cannot access any in-person learning “due to insecurity,” UNICEF said. 
     
            Earlier this year, CNN reported on Ukrainian children attending newly built bunker schools in the northern city of Kharkiv as daily Russian strikes rained down overhead.

Our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine has moved here.
 
            Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing early Thursday morning local time to begin a two-day state visit to China, according to TASS and Chinese state media CCTV.
     
            Russia has stepped up its disinformation efforts to discredit Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and raise questions about his legitimacy in recent months, US intelligence agencies have observed.
     
            A recently downgraded intelligence assessment shared with CNN says that Russia has seized on various recent events to fuel criticism about Zelensky’s abilities and place as Ukraine’s leader, a senior Biden administration official said in an interview.
     
            Russia has spread disinformation about Zelensky since before the war started but recent intelligence shows “it’s definitely increasing,” the official said.
     
            Russia has highlighted two main areas in this recent disinformation push, the intelligence indicates: Ukraine’s painful withdrawal from the eastern city of Avdiivka and the fact that Ukraine postponed its presidential election scheduled for this Spring due to the war.
     
Wider impacts: The US is more concerned about the impact of the disinformation on countries abroad than on Ukrainians’ confidence in Zelensky, the official said.
     
            “That’s why we’re briefing our allies and partners about this,” the official said. “We want to make sure that this type of Russian disinformation doesn’t take hold and other countries that might not realize, ‘Oh, of course, they can’t hold elections because they’re in a state of martial law as a consequence of Russia’s war.’”
     
Dive deeper into Russia’s disinformation campaign and what it could mean. 
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded his trip to Kyiv on Wednesday, where he reaffirmed the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine as Russia’s advances continue in the Kharkiv region of the country. 
     
            Earlier Wednesday, Blinken announced $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine and said much-needed ammunition and weapons are being rushed to the front lines. The US State Department acknowledged that the $2 billion in foreign military financing is coming primarily from the recently passed Ukraine Security supplemental and $400 million of it is coming from existing Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that had not previously been allocated to Ukraine.
     
            Blinken also said that the US remains “committed” to helping Ukraine win the war against Russia, but it is not encouraging strikes on Russian territory. Blinken added that Washington strongly supports a Ukrainian peace summit set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
            Here are more of the latest headlines: 
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US remains “committed” to helping Ukraine win the war against Russia, but it is not encouraging strikes on Russian territory. 
     
        “We’ve not encouraged or enabled strikes outside Ukraine but ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it’s going to conduct this war, a war it’s conducting in defense of its freedom, of its sovereignty, of its territorial integrity and we’ll continue to back Ukraine with the equipment it needs to succeed,” Blinken said on Wednesday during a joint news conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minster Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv. 
     
 
            Blinken also announced that the US will provide an additional $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine, adding “we put this together in a first-of-its-kind defense enterprise fund.”
     
            The fund will have three components, Blinken said, including: 
     
            “Of course, everyone’s eyes are focused on the situation in the east and northeast, Kharkiv in particular. And so the newest support that I just announced, but particularly the $60 billion supplemental, we know is coming at a critical time,” Blinken said.  
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called a shooting attack on Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico “appalling.” 
     
        “We strongly condemn this act of violence against our neighboring partner state’s head of government. Every effort should be made to ensure that violence does not become the norm in any country, form, or sphere,” Zelensky wrote in a post on X Wednesday. 
     
 
            Fico was shot multiple times, according to a statement on his official Facebook page, adding he is currently in a life-threatening condition.
     
            “We sincerely hope Robert Fico recovers soon and express our solidarity with the people of Slovakia,” Zelensky continued. 
     
For context: Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized Western support for Ukraine. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies toward the Kremlin and blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Russia’s president has used to justify his invasion.
     
            Fico, who began his fourth term last October, has shifted Slovakia’s foreign policy toward pro-Russian positions and initiated reforms in criminal law and media regulations, raising concerns about the erosion of the rule of law.
     
            Fico also had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions in what would upend Slovakia’s staunch backing for Ukraine.
     
            Ukrainian officials suggested further gains by Russian forces on Wednesday in the Kharkiv region, as Moscow continues its push into northeastern Ukraine.
     
            The town of Vovchansk, located about 60 kilometers (or about 37 miles) northeast of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, is seeing some of the most intense battles in areas near the border, with one police official saying Russian forces are already in the town. 
     
        “The situation in Vovchansk is extremely difficult. The enemy is taking positions on the streets of Vovchansk,” said Oleksii Kharkivskyi, chief patrol officer of the Vovchansk Police Department, urging residents to evacuate. 
     
 
            Gen. Serhii “Marcel” Melnyk, the commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, also suggested there have been changes in Ukrainian positions in Vovchansk and a possible tactical withdrawal. 
     
        “Heavy fighting is ongoing. In some areas, near Vovchansk and Lukiantsi, Ukrainian defenders were forced to move to more favorable positions to more effectively use their forces and defend the region from the offensive,” Melnyk said Wednesday. 
     
 
            At least 24 people, including four children, were injured as a result of Russian shelling in various parts of the Kharkiv region on Wednesday, Melnyk said.
     
            The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepStateMap indicated on Wednesday that Russian forces have reached northeastern parts of Vovchansk as they continue to push further south into Ukrainian territory. Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages near the border in recent days. 
     
            Mandatory evacuations continue from all northern border settlements, according to Roman Semenukha, deputy head of Kharkiv Regional Military Administration. Nearly 8,000 people have been evacuated from these areas since May 10, when Russia launched its push. 
     
            At least 1,993 children in Ukraine have been killed or wounded since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to the UN’s children’s agency (UNICEF), reiterating calls for a ceasefire.
     
            On average, at least two children lose their lives in Ukraine every day, UNICEF reported on Tuesday. 
     
        “Ukraine’s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services, and psychosocial support,” the agency said in a statement. “More than anything, Ukraine’s children need peace.”
     
 
Mental health impact: The war in Ukraine has “harmfully affected” the mental health and wellbeing of children, UNICEF said, adding that half of teenagers report trouble sleeping. At least one in five suffer intrusive thoughts and flashbacks.
     
Loss of education: Almost half of children enrolled in school in Ukraine have been robbed of in-person education, according to the report. Nearly one million children across the country cannot access any in-person learning “due to insecurity,” UNICEF added. 
     
            Earlier this year, CNN reported on Ukrainian children attending newly built bunker schools in the northern city of Kharkiv, as daily Russian strikes rained down overhead.  
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday the provision of additional $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine and said much-needed weapons and ammunition are being rushed to the front lines. 
     
        “Ukraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught,” Blinken said during a news conference in Kyiv, speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, adding he discussed weapons deliveries with Kuleba and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
     
 
            “We are rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses. Rushing them to get to the front lines to protect soldiers, to protect civilians,” Blinken said, pointing out that air defenses are “a top priority.”
     
            Blinken also said Washington strongly supports a Ukrainian peace summit set to take place next month in Switzerland. 
     
This post has been updated with the latest comments from Blinken.
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken convened with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv on Wednesday, as part of his surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital.
     
            The senior White House official told the delegation more support for Ukraine is “literally on its way.” 
     
            Kuleba thanked Blinken for the latest aid package from the US, worth nearly $61 billion, and for focusing on “tangible results” in the face of Russia’s invasion. Support from Washington, as well as Blinken’s presence “sends a message to the people of Ukraine,” Kuleba added.
     
            Blinken agreed that sending weapons to the country was more valuable, adding “support in concrete terms is very much on the way.” 
     
            “The people on the frontlines, they need that support and they will get it,” he added. 
     
            The US is committed to working together to build “a strong successful thriving Ukraine,” Blinken said, adding that reaffirming ties with Kyiv would be the strongest “rebuke to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.”
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will halt all international events scheduled for the coming days, his office announced on Wednesday, as Russian troops push into the northeastern Kharkiv region.
     
        “Volodymyr Zelenskyy has instructed that all international events involving him scheduled for the coming days be postponed and new dates coordinated,” Zelensky’s office said in a statement. “We are grateful to our partners for their understanding.”
     
 
            It came days after Ukraine’s top military general warned fighting had “significantly worsened” in Kharkiv, as Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive.
     
In the spotlight: More than two years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Zelensky has fought to keep attention on Kyiv’s military efforts to deter advances from Moscow by strengthening ties with allies. Most recently, he thanked US lawmakers after they voted in favor of a new aid package worth nearly $61 billion. At the same time, European leaders approved a plan for regular payments to Ukraine as part of a $54 billion package.
     
            Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that troops had suppressed a large aerial attack on the Crimean peninsula by Ukrainian forces.
     
            Moscow said that it intercepted 10 “American Atakms [ATACMS] tactical missiles” over Crimea. 
     
            Missiles were shot down near the Belbek military airfield, according to Mikhail Razvozhayev, governor of Crimea’s port city of Sevastopol, suggesting that could be the Ukrainians’ target.
     
            Elsewhere in Russia, there were two explosions at a fuel base in the Proletarsky district because of two drone attacks, according to Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region. 
     
            No casualties were reported in any of the attacks.
     
            During his current visit to Kyiv, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said American ATACMS were part of the newly supplied arms already “on the front lines.”
     
            On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Blinken that Ukraine urgently needed aerial defenses. 
     
            CNN has reached out to Ukrainian authorities for comment. 
     
            Ukraine’s northern region of Kharkiv is enduring “heavy fighting” as Russian troops pushed on with ground and air offensives on Wednesday, Ukraine’s army said. 
     
            “Heavy fighting is ongoing,” said General Serhii Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces. 
     
            “Three combat engagements are still ongoing,” Melnyk said. 
     
        “In some areas, near (the towns of) Vovchansk and Lukiantsi, Ukrainian defenders were forced to move to more favorable positions to more effectively use their forces and defend the region from the offensive.”
     
 
            Kharkiv’s border town of Vovchansk was liberated from Russian occupation more than 18 months ago. 
     
            Ukrainian troops repelled 11 attacks and are holding back Russia’s advance towards “Lyptsi from Hlyboke and Lukiantsi, and towards Vovchansk from the direction of Shebekino (Russia),” Melnyk said.
     
            “Three combat engagements are still ongoing,” Melnyk said. 
     
            Kharkiv city was hit Tuesday by a Russian airstrike that wounded 24 people, including 4 children, and damaged residential buildings, Melnyk said.
     
            The attack also killed one person. 
     
        “On May 14, an enemy drone crashed into a residential building on a city street, killing an 80-year-old woman. Another person was killed in the village of Hatyshche,” according to the city’s defense forces commander.
     
 
            Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that they had “liberated” the settlement of Buhrovatka in the Kharkiv region and “defeated the manpower and equipment” of Ukraine’s army in Vesele, Vovchansk, and Lyptsi.
     
            Russia is continuing its push into northeastern Ukraine since making several advances there over the past week after launching a surprise cross-border assault.
     
            These are Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured the Kharkiv region in 2022. 
     
            On Tuesday, at least 21 civilians, including two 12-year-old girls and an 8-year-old boy, were wounded in Russian attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest, according to prosecutors.
     
            More than 7,500 people have been evacuated from the region. In the neighboring Sumy region, officials have also ordered a “voluntary evacuation” for several towns where attacks have increased, according to the military administration.
     
Here are the latest developments:
 
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken took to the stage at a bar in Kyiv during his state visit, playing the guitar with a Ukrainian band and singing Neil Young’s 1989 hit “Rockin’ in the Free World.” 
     
        “The United States is with you. So much of the world is with you and they’re fighting not just for Ukraine but for the free world, and the free world is with you too,” Blinken told the crowd. 
     
 
            The visit, in which Blinken met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, comes as Russian forces make significant gains on the battlefield.  
     
            The US State Department said Blinken and Zelensky discussed battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived US aid to help repel Russian attacks. Zelensky told US Blinken that Ukraine urgently needs more air defenses.
     
            Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the “unprecedented level of strategic partnership” between Moscow and Beijing informed his decision to choose China for his first trip since entering a new term in office just over a week ago.
     
        “Today, Russia-China relations have reached the highest level ever, and despite the difficult global situation continue to get stronger,” Putin said in an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday, ahead of his arrival in Beijing on Thursday.
     
 
            During his visit, Putin is expected to discuss situations in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, according to Putin’s assistant for foreign affairs, Yuri Ushakov, state media RIA Novosti reported.
     
            Speaking to Xinhua, Putin commended China for its 12-point plan calling to end hostilities in Ukraine and bashed Ukraine’s “Western patrons” for “stubbornly working to ‘punish’ Russia, isolate and weaken it.”
     
More context: Putin’s visit mirrors Xi’s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president – like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve.
     
            It also comes as Russia claims to have captured further villages in Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv region as it expands its surprise cross-border offensive.
     
Read the full story.
 
            Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator announced on Tuesday that emergency power cuts are being introduced following a series of Russian attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure.
 
            Emergency shutdowns across Ukraine were implemented from 9 p.m. to midnight local time Tuesday, according to Ukrenergo.
     
            The “significant” power shortage had been made worse when people used more energy during recent cold weather, Ukrenergo added. 
     
More context: Moscow has stepped up efforts to paralyze Ukraine’s energy system in the past month, as Ukrainian troops struggle to hold positions on key frontlines, particularly in the east.
     
            On May 8, Russian forces carried out a “massive” missile attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, targeting power generation and transmission facilities in the Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Vinnytsia regions.
     
            Ukraine’s biggest power company, DTEK, said Russian missiles hit three of its thermal power plants on May 8, adding it was the fifth time its infrastructure had been targeted in the last six weeks. 
     
            At least 21 civilians, including two 12-year-old girls and an 8-year-old boy, were wounded in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on Tuesday, according to prosecutors.
     
            Russian forces used glide bombs in three waves of attacks, striking more than 20 targets, according to Oleksandr Filchakov, Kharkiv region prosecutor.
     
            Glide bombs can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives and are dropped from aircraft which — in the case of attacks on the Kharkiv border region — do not even need to enter Ukrainian airspace.
     
            Writing on Telegram, Filchakov said that several apartment blocks, a shopping center, and an education institution were damaged in the bombardment that also set cars and garages ablaze. 
     
            The attack comes as Russian forces continue their advance into the Kharkiv region. Russian troops are regaining control of villages and areas of Ukraine that they were forced from near the end of 2022 during a Ukrainian counteroffensive. 
     
            Ukraine’s State Emergency Service on Tuesday said over 7,500 civilians had been evacuated from their homes during heavy fighting in the north of Kharkiv region. 
     
            Reporting live from central Ukraine, CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh said Russian troops are moving fast and have better resources and better ammunition. It is also clear that Ukrainians have failed to build sufficient defenses in the region.
     
            Ukraine is calling for more rocket artillery ammunition and missiles to be sent to them as a priority, especially 155mm shells, so that it can repel Russia’s resurgent invading force. 
     
            Georgia’s president has called on protesters to use their vote in upcoming parliamentary elections to “reverse” the controversial foreign agents law passed by the country’s parliament on Tuesday.
     
            President Salome Zourabichvili admitted to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that there are “many concerns” after the parliament voted in favor of the controversial foreign agents law.
     
        “The way and the place where we can reverse all of this is the elections in October… And we have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections,” Zourabichvili said.
     
 
            The president, who has previously accused Russia of trying to bolster its influence over the former Soviet country, told CNN that she will symbolically veto the law.
     
            Due to the setup of Georgia’s parliamentary system, Zourabichvili holds mainly a figurehead role and her veto can be overruled by a simple parliamentary majority.
     
            She called the law a complete “duplicate” of one passed by the Kremlin in 2012, which she said has been used to “completely oppress and repress the civil society” in Russia.
     
            Russia is growing more and “more worried” by Georgia’s rapprochement with the European Union, Zourabichvili remarked, referencing the recent decision by the bloc to grant Georgia candidate status.
     
            Although roughly 20% of Georgian territory is currently controlled by Russia following the 2008 invasion, Georgia has not been “diverted” from “following its European path,” the president added.
     
        “It has not stopped us an inch and it will not stop us continuing,” she added.
     
 
            The White House has slammed Georgia’s controversial foreign agents legislation, warning that if enacted, it would “compel” the US to reevaluate its relationship with the country.
     
        “We’re deeply troubled by Georgia’s Kremlin-style foreign agents legislation,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.“We will see what the parliament does, but if this legislation passes, it will compel us to fundamentally reassess our relationship with Georgia.”
     
 
            When pressed later on what she meant, Jean-Pierre would not elaborate. The legislation has already passed the country’s parliament, but its president has vowed to veto it. It’s unclear if that veto would then be overridden. 
     
            The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country that, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow’s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit.
     
            Georgia’s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili. Zourabichvili will then have two weeks to veto it, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the US intends to make use of seized Russian assets to provide funding for the reconstruction of Ukraine.
     
            “Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,” Blinken said during a speech at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine. 
     
        “What Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.”
     
 
            Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with “Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets.”
     
        “The G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,” Blinken said.
     
 
            Blinken’s remarks come after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Blinken reiterated the US “commitment to Ukraine’s recovery,” according to a State Department spokesperson.
     
            During his visit to Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the Biden administration’s strong support of the beleaguered country as Russia advances in the Kharkiv region.
     
        “I have come to Ukraine with a message. You are not alone,” Blinken said at a briefing at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute on Tuesday.
     
 
            The speech came after Congress and the White House passed a funding package that included $60-plus billion in aid to Ukraine, and the EU approved a financial package of up to $54 billion.
     
            Blinken focused much of his speech on building security and economic infrastructure in Ukraine to pave a path to NATO acceptance.
     
        “When we hold the Washington Summit in July, we’ll take tangible steps to increase NATO’s role in building a resilient, capable Ukrainian force, supporting its ongoing reforms that are integrating Ukraine into the alliance,” Blinken said.
     
 
            Georgia’s parliament has passed a controversial “foreign agents” bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country’s chances of joining the bloc.
     
            The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines. 
     
            Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.
     
            Georgian Dream, the ruling party that pushed through the legislation, has hit back at criticism, saying the move will promote transparency and national sovereignty. But the party has long been suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies.
     
            Nightly protests have been shutting down the capital, Tbilisi, for about a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the city of 1 million people to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”
     
            Georgia applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic’s drift toward Russia.
     
            Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and still occupies about 20% of Georgia’s internationally recognized territory.
     
            While attention is focused on advances in Kharkiv, Russia’s forces continue to exploit Ukraine’s weaknesses elsewhere, in particular along a stretch of the frontline west of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk.
     
            Since Russia captured the industrial town of Avdiivka in February, its forces have taken advantage of Kyiv’s acute shortage in artillery ammunition, as well as manpower deficiencies, by pushing into a series of towns and villages.
     
            Ukraine’s General Staff, in its Tuesday morning update, hinted clearly at further tactical withdrawals in the area around the village of Ocheretyne – which was captured by Russian troops earlier this month.
     
        “In order to save the lives of our defenders, the positions of the Defense Forces were changed in some areas due to intense enemy fire,” the General Staff reported.
     
 
            The DeepStateMap monitoring group shows small Russian advances most days in the area, each one moving them a little closer to the town of Pokrovsk, a key military hub for logistics and supplies along the entire eastern part of the frontline.
     
            Further to the west, Ukrainian forces are also coming under pressure southeast of Zaporizhzhia, one of the few areas where they achieved success, albeit modest in size, in last summer’s counteroffensive.
     
            Both Russian military bloggers and Ukraine’s DeepStateMap report small Russian advances into a pocket of re-captured Ukrainian territory between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove.
     
            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister has hailed ties with Serbia, traditionally seen as one of Europe’s more Russian-leaning states, on a visit to Belgrade. 
     
            He was accompanied on the trip by Olena Zelenska, wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
     
            In March 2022, Kyiv’s Serbian embassy closed with the United States and the United Kingdom accusing Serbian businesses of assisting Russia in circumventing sanctions. 
     
            Following Monday’s meeting between Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic the embassy is set to be reopened. 
     
        “We are grateful to the Serbian president for agreeing to hold a Ukrainian-Serbian business forum in the near future, as well as to resume the work of the Serbian embassy in Ukraine for the first time since March 2022,” Kuleba said in a post on X.
     
 
            Kuleba also said he and Vucic discussed a variety of bilateral issues building on “productive dialogue” Vucic has previously had with Zelensky. 
     
            Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has aided the war-torn country by sheltering Ukrainians and donating humanitarian aid.
     
            First Lady Olena Zelenska expressed gratitude to Serbia for its contribution.
     
        “The needs of Ukrainians for emergency medical care have increased significantly, as the Russian terror against Ukrainian settlements not only continues, but also shows an alarming tendency to intensify,” Zelenska said.“I am grateful to Serbia for understanding that people matter most,” added Zelenska, who visited the country to take part in a mental health conference. 
     
 
            Traditionally one of Moscow’s closest allies in Europe, Belgrade has long tried to balance its historical ties to Russia and a potential future of closer European integration.
     
            Serbia’s contribution to Ukraine aid can be seen as part of its commitment to joining the European Union, but its relationship with the bloc is strained refusing to participate in EU sanctions rounds against Russia.

Our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine has moved here.
 
            Georgia’s president has called on protesters to use their vote in upcoming parliamentary elections to “reverse” the controversial foreign agents law passed by the country’s parliament on Tuesday.
     
            President Salome Zourabichvili admitted to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that there are “many concerns” after the parliament voted in favor of the controversial foreign agents law.
     
        “The way and the place where we can reverse all of this is the elections in October…And we have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections,” Zourabichvili said.
     
 
            The president, who has previously accused Russia of trying to bolster its influence over the former Soviet country, told CNN that she will symbolically veto the law.
     
            Due to the setup of Georgia’s parliamentary system, Zourabichvili holds mainly a figurehead role and her veto can be overruled by a simple parliamentary majority.
     
            She called the law a complete “duplicate” of one passed by the Kremlin in 2012 which she said has been used to “completely oppress and repress the civil society” in Russia.
     
            Russia is growing more and “more worried” by Georgia’s rapprochement with the European Union, Zourabichvili remarked, referencing the recent decision by the bloc to grant Georgia candidate status.
     
            Although roughly 20% of Georgian territory is currently controlled by Russia following the 2008 invasion, Georgia has not been “diverted” from “following its European path,” the president added.
     
            “It has not stopped us an inch and it will not stop us continuing,” she added.
     
            The White House has slammed Georgia’s controversial foreign agents legislation, warning that if enacted it would “compel” the US to reevaluate its relationship with the country.
     
        “We’re deeply troubled by Georgia’s Kremlin-style foreign agents legislation,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday. 
     
 
            “This weekend, we saw some of the largest protests in Georgia’s history, with tens of thousands of peaceful protesters, undeterred by intimidation tactics telling their government to oppose this legislation because they want a Euro-Atlantic future. 
     
            “We will see what the parliament does, but if this legislation passes, it will compel us to fundamentally reassess our relationship with Georgia.”
     
            When pressed later on what she meant, Jean-Pierre would not elaborate. The legislation has already passed the country’s parliament, but its president has vowed to veto it. It’s unclear if that veto would then be overridden. 
     
            Georgia’s parliament passed the controversial law by 84 votes to 30, despite widespread domestic opposition to the move, which would require any organizations receiving more than 20% of funding from abroad to register as foreign agents.
     
            Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.
     
            The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country which, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow’s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit.
     
            Georgia’s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili. Zourabichvili will then have two weeks to veto it, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority.
     
            Ukraine’s Foreign Minister has hailed ties with Serbia, traditionally seen as one of Europe’s more Russian-leaning states, on a visit to Belgrade. He was accompanied on the trip by Olena Zelenska, wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
     
            In March 2022, Kyiv’s Serbian embassy closed with the United States and the United Kingdom accusing Serbian businesses of assisting Russia in circumventing sanctions. 
     
            Following Monday’s meeting between Foreign Minister Kuleba and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic the embassy is set to be reopened. 
     
            “We are grateful to the Serbian president for agreeing to hold a Ukrainian-Serbian business forum in the near future, as well as to resume the work of the Serbian embassy in Ukraine for the first time since March 2022,” Kuleba said in a post on X.
     
            Kuleba also said he and Vucic discussed a variety of bilateral issues building on “productive dialogue” Vucic has previously had with Zelensky. 
     
            Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has aided the war-torn country by sheltering Ukrainians and donating humanitarian aid.
     
            In a statement during her visit to the country to participate in a mental health conference, First Lady Olena Zelenska expressed gratitude to Serbia for its contribution.
     
        “The needs of Ukrainians for emergency medical care have increased significantly, as the Russian terror against Ukrainian settlements not only continues, but also shows an alarming tendency to intensify,” Zelenska said. 
     
 
            “I am grateful to Serbia for understanding that people matter most,” added Zelenska, who visited the country to take part in a mental health conference. 
     
            Traditionally one of Moscow’s closest allies in Europe, Belgrade has long tried to walk a tightrope between its historical ties to Russia and a potential future of closer European integration.
     
            Serbia’s contribution to Ukraine aid can be seen as part of its commitment to joining the European Union, but its relationship with the bloc is strained refusing to participate in EU sanctions rounds against Russia.  
     
            “Serbia is deeply committed to becoming a member of the European Union and has voted for the United Nations resolution condemning Russian actions in Ukraine and has upheld its territorial integrity and sovereignty, and repeatedly sent various types of aid,” Serbia’s ambassador to the United States said in a statement to CNN last year. 
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the US intends to make use of seized Russian assets to provide funding for the reconstruction of Ukraine.
     
            “Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,” Blinken said during a speech at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine. 
     
        “What Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.”
     
 
            Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with “Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets.”
     
            “The G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,” Blinken said.
     
            Blinken’s remarks come after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Blinken reiterated the US “commitment to Ukraine’s recovery,” according to a State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller.
     
            During his visit to Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the Biden administration’s strong support of the beleaguered country amid Russia’s recent advances in Kharkiv.
     
        “I have come to Ukraine with a message. You are not alone,” Blinken said at a briefing at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.
     
 
            The speech comes after Congress and the White House passed a funding package that included $60-plus billion in aid to Ukraine, and the EU approved a financial package of up to $54 billion.
     
            Blinken focused much of his speech about building security and economic infrastructure in Ukraine to pave a path to NATO acceptance. 
     
            “When we hold the Washington Summit in July, we’ll take tangible steps to increase NATO’s role in building a resilient, capable Ukrainian force, supporting its ongoing reforms that are integrating Ukraine into the alliance,” Blinken said.
     
            French President Emmanuel Macron told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call on Tuesday that France will send more military aid to Ukraine “in the coming days and weeks.”
     
            During the call, Macron condemned the “intensification of Russian strikes on Ukraine, notably on its energy infrastructure” and reiterated “France’s determination to provide all the support necessary” to Kyiv in concert with its international partners.
     
            Georgia’s parliament has passed a controversial “foreign agents” bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country’s chances of joining the bloc.

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv earlier Tuesday, a meeting that comes at especially difficult time for Ukraine. Russia continues its push into northeastern Ukraine after making several advances there over the past week, marking Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured Kharkiv in 2022. Here is what you need to know:
     
            European Union (EU) leaders on Tuesday approved a plan that will see a regular flow of payments as part of its Ukraine financial assistance plan, known as the Ukraine Facility program, after the bloc determined the country has met the preconditions required to unlock a financial package of up to $54 billion.
     
            The Ukraine Facility program, according to the EU Council, is intended to help assist Ukraine with the recovery, reconstruction and modernization of the country.
     
            According to an EU Council press release, an initial $2 billion of “pre-financing” will be disbursed until regular payments can begin. The payments will be subjected to the agreed reforms Ukraine must take as part of its EU accession process in the next four years.
     
            “An important step has been made to deliver much-needed, regular and predictable financial support to Ukraine’s recovery, reconstruction, and modernisation over the next four years. The EU has once more confirmed its commitment to Ukraine’s stability and growth,” Vincent van Peteghem, president of the EU Council, said in a statement. 
     
            Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked EU members for approving the plan. Writing on Telegram, he said he expects Ukraine to receive $17 billion in the next year under the program.
     
        “This will strengthen our financial stability in the face of a full-scale war with Russia,” Shmyhal said.
     
 
            More than 7,000 people have been evacuated from the Kharkiv region, the head of the region’s military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said on Tuesday. 
     
            The majority of the evacuations took place in the Chuhuiv and Kharkiv districts, with volunteers assisting efforts. 
     
            Meanwhile, the Sumy region, which borders the Kharkiv region, has also ordered a “voluntary evacuation” for several towns where attacks have increased, according to the region’s military administration.
     
            In a statement on Telegram, the Sumy regional military administration outlined that people in Bilopillia and Vorozhba are being encouraged to evacuate, especially families and children. 
     
        “This is not a forced evacuation, but an early voluntary evacuation from those settlements where the number of attacks has significantly increased,” the head of the region’s military administration, Volodymyr Artuikh, said Tuesday.
     
 
            The administration also stated that evacuation efforts are also continuing for border communities in the region, which have been under an evacuation order since July 2023.
     
            Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has sought to reassure Ukrainians that Russia’s operations in the northern Kharkiv border area will not lead to defensive gaps elsewhere along the frontline.
     
            “We understand how the enemy is acting, and we see the plan to draw our forces back,” Zelensky said in an address on Monday evening.
     
            “Of course, we are not leaving the Donetsk areas without the necessary support and supplies, namely the Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk directions,” he added.
     
            Many Ukrainians believe Russia’s real intentions in its Kharkiv push are to force Ukraine to redeploy troops defending key locations further south, including Chasiv Yar, which sits on high ground west of Bakhmut. 
     
            Russian soldiers have been making steady advances towards it in recent weeks and the capture of Chasiv Yar would being Russia closer to three key military towns – Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – in the Donetsk region.
     
            While Russia’s desire to capture all of Donetsk is clear – it announced it had annexed the region back in 2022 – some analysts argue the Kharkiv operation might also be about the creation of a buffer zone along Russia’s border with Ukraine.
     
            The Institute for the Study of War says reports of the destruction of several bridges across key waterways suggest Moscow is “prioritizing the creation of a ‘buffer zone’ over a deeper penetration into the region.”
     
            Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has made several references in the past to creating such a zone inside Ukraine, to better protect Russian towns like Belgorod from coming under Ukrainian attack.
     
            Russian forces continue to make advances south into Ukrainian villages in the Kharkiv region after launching their surprise cross-border assault four days ago.  
     
            One of the main Russian efforts appears targeted on Lyptsi, described by one Ukrainian military blogger as “a very important village” – due to its position on Ukraine’s second defensive line.
     
            The DeepStateMap monitoring group indicates two further settlements in the direction of the village have been taken under full or partial Russian control, though Serhii Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, said an attempted advance on Lyptsi itself had been repelled.
     
            Reports make clear that Russia continues to make heavy use of large glide bombs ahead of its ground operations. Glide bombs can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives and are dropped from aircraft which – in the case of attacks on the Kharkiv border region – do not even need to enter Ukrainian airspace.
     
            A Ukrainian National Guard Special Forces unit reported 20 such aerial attacks in one direction alone.
     
            Meanwhile, a few dozen kilometers to the east, Vovchansk remains a Russian focus, though it appears Ukraine has still managed to prevent a full Russian assault on the town.
     
            German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has appealed to European countries to do more to support Ukraine, saying he hoped they would provide Ukraine with “munition, artillery, tanks, and air defense, and especially Patriot [air defense systems.]”
     
            Speaking in Stockholm on Tuesday, the German chancellor vowed support for Ukraine for as long as necessary.
     
            Scholz said Germany’s announcement in April that it would send a third Patriot system to Ukraine had not been an easy decision as Germany did not have many systems of its own. 
     
            Some of Ukraine’s allies have come under increasing pressure to provide Ukraine with air defense systems.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month showed his dissatisfaction over deliveries of Western military aid from key allies, saying air defense, in particular Patriot systems, were “what [Ukraine’s] partners have and what should be working here in Ukraine now, to destroy Russian terrorist ambitions.” 
     
            Only the US, Germany and the Netherlands have supplied Patriot systems to Ukraine so far. Spain promised to send Patriot missiles but not a full battery.
     
            Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that his country urgently needs more air defenses as it faces increased attacks from Russia in the east.
     
            “Air defense (is) the biggest deficit for us. I think that the biggest problem is … today we really need two Patriots for Kharkiv region because there are people under attack: civilians and warriors. Everybody. They are under Russian missiles,” Zelensky told reporters ahead of his meeting with Blinken. 
     
            The Institute for the Study of War in Washington said last month that Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukraine have become much more effective in recent months, even though there was no dramatic increase in their size or frequency.
     
            “Instead, Russian forces are exploiting the degradation of Ukraine’s air defense umbrella caused by continued delays in Western security assistance and appear to be leveraging tactical adaptations stemming from several months of Russian efforts to test Ukrainian air defenses,” the Washington-based group said in a report. 
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has concluded his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, after discussing “recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived U.S. security assistance,” according to US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
     
            “The two discussed recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly-arrived US security assistance to helping repel Russian attacks,” Miller said in a read-out following the meeting. “They also discussed long-term security arrangements and ongoing work to ensure Ukraine can thrive economically. Secretary Blinken reiterated the United States’ enduring support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and our commitment to Ukraine’s recovery.”
     
            Blinken’s visit comes as Russia continues its new push into northeastern Ukraine after making several major advances there over the past week, marking Moscow’s most significant gains since Kyiv’s forces recaptured Kharkiv in late summer 2022.
     
            US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the long-awaited US military assistance has started arriving in Ukraine, after months of delays caused by political haggling in the US Congress. 
     
            Blinken is the first of Biden administration official to visit Kyiv after the passage of the Ukraine funding, which Kyiv and its allies hope could be a turning point in the war. 
     
            The $61 billion package includes about $23 billion to replenish US weapons, stockpiles and facilities and nearly $14 billion to help Ukraine buy advanced weapons systems and other defense equipment. More than $11 billion will fund current US military operations in the wider region.
     
            As he met Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday, Blinken said that “the assistance was now on the way.” 
     
            “Some of it already arrived, and more of it will be arriving, and that’s going to make a real difference against the Russian aggression on the battlefield,” he said. “We are determined, along with many partners of Ukraine, to make sure you succeed on the battlefield.”
     
            US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has arrived in Kyiv at the time when Ukraine needs as much help as it can get. 
     
            Russia has made significant gains on the battlefield in recent weeks, including on Ukraine’s northern border near Kharkiv, where it took control of several villages. Kharkiv is Ukraine’s second biggest city and it is becoming more vulnerable to attacks as Russia inches closer to its edges.
     
            In a rare and frank admission of how bad the picture is at the moment, Ukraine’s top general Oleksandr Syrskyi said that the situation in the northern Kharkiv region has “significantly worsened” after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. 
     
            Moscow has managed to take advantage of Ukraine’s ammunition shortages, pushing through multiple spots alongside the eastern Ukraine frontline as the US Congress dragged its feet for months on the $61 billion Ukraine aid package.
     
            The assistance has been approved last month, but it will take months for the crucial weapons to be delivered where they are needed. Russia, meanwhile, continues to gain momentum. 
     
            Blinken admitted as much ahead of his meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying “We know this is a challenging time.”
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday, marking the first visit of a Biden administration official to Ukraine following the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country, the State Department announced.
     
            Coming amid Ukrainian setbacks on the battlefield, Blinken intends to send a “strong signal of reassurance to the Ukrainians,” the official said.
     
        “The secretary’s mission here is really to talk about how our supplemental assistance is going to be executed in a fashion that helps shore up their defenses, enable them to increasingly take back the initiative on the battlefield looking forward,” the official said.
     
 
            Blinken will also discuss “the other steps that we’re taking to provide long-term assurance and commitment on the security front to the Ukrainians, including our bilateral security agreement,” the official added.
     
            During his fourth visit to Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion, Blinken is also scheduled to meet with civil society and private sector partners as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. US officials acknowledge that the slowdown in US support, due to congressional infighting, has exacerbated a challenging situation for Ukraine.

            Cinese leader Xi Jinping will welcome Vladimir Putin to China on Thursday for the Russian president’s second visit in less than a year – the latest sign of their growing alignment amid hardening global fault lines as conflict devastates Gaza and Ukraine.
     
            Putin will arrive in China just over a week since entering a new term in office, extending his autocratic rule until 2030 – the result of an election without any true opposition.
     
            His visit, set to take place May 16-17, according to Chinese state media, mirrors Xi’s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president – like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve.
     
            Their meeting comes months ahead of the American presidential elections and as Washington faces mounting international backlash over its support for Israel’s war on Gaza. It’s set to provide a platform for the leaders to discuss how all this can advance their shared ambition to degrade and offer an alternative to American power.
     
            The visit also comes as the two leaders operate within what observers say is a loose but growing coordination of interests between avowedly anti-American countries Iran and North Korea. Pyongyang – which has an economy almost entirely dependent of China – is believed by Western governments to be aiding Russia with war supplies, as is Tehran, which is being bolstered economically by Russia and China and is a powerful player in the conflict in the Middle East.

            Uraine’s top general says the situation in the northern Kharkiv region has “significantly worsened” after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive.
     
            A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia’s progress was not yet “significant” but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an “extremely dangerous moment,” adding that Russia had effectively “invaded [Ukraine] again.”
     
            The precise goal of Russia’s new push – which began in the early hours of Friday morning – is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south.
     
            Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south – which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address.
     
            “The idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians’ ability to defend ourselves,” he said.
     
            According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city.

            Rssian President Vladimir Putin’s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country’s defense ministry with someone widely seen as a competent technocrat.
     
            That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry of Defense from Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012.
     
            Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia’s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia’s economy.
     
            “Putin’s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,” Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X. “Belousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.”
     
            Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia.
     
            US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition: NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly three times more artillery shells per year than the US and Europe for Ukraine.
     
Read the full story.
 
            The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”
     
            You rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline.
     
            Moscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61 billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead.
     
            First, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war.  
     
            And secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.
     
            Ukraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year.
