Russia's President Vladimir Putin arrives for a meeting with Argentina's President Mauricio Macri at the Casa Rosada Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018. Russian President Vladimir
Putin said on Saturday there had been no discussion with Ukraine
about the possible release of the Ukrainian sailors who were
seized along with their ships by Russia last month. Putin spoke with reporters on the sidelines of a G20 summit
in Buenos Aires.  Russia is resisting international calls to
release three Ukrainian naval ships that its border patrols
fired upon and seized in the strait near Russian-annexed Crimea
last weekend. Moscow accused the 24 sailors of illegally crossing the
Russian border. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Saturday his country had stepped up security at vital infrastructure sites such as nuclear power stations and Black Sea ports in the face of what he called a Russian test of the world order. ""(Russia) has deployed land forces of around 80,000 Russian troops, about 1,400 artillery and missile systems, 900 tanks, 2,300 armoured vehicles, about 500 planes and 300 helicopters,"" Poroshenko wrote on Twitter. Putin said he would not introduce tit-for-tat restrictions
on the entry of Ukrainians into Russia after Kiev imposed a ban on Russian males aged 16 to 60 from entering its territory. After US President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting
with Putin at the G20 summit, citing the military tensions with
Ukraine, the Russian leader said there were no pre-conditions
for future bilateral talks. ""It is regrettable that we can't succeed in holding a
full-scale meeting, which is long due,"" Putin said, adding that
issues of strategic stability would be of paramount importance. Putin and Trump had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the
G20 summit on Friday, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said. Trump's administration has accused Russia of non-compliance
with the 31-year-old Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaty and has said it will pull out of the deal as a result.
The Kremlin denies violating the pact. ""This is related to the issues of strategic stability,
especially after the president declared his desire to withdraw
from the INF missile treaty,"" Putin added."

Ukrainian believers gather at the front of the Saint Sophia's Cathedral during church council to convene to create an independent Ukrainian Orthodox church in Kiev, Ukraine on December 15, 2018. Ukraine chose the leader of a new national church on Saturday, marking an historic split from Russia which its leaders see as vital to the country's security and independence. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Metropolitan Epifaniy, of the Kiev Patriarchate church, had been chosen as head of the new church. ""This day will go into history as a sacred day ... the day of the final independence from Russia,"" Poroshenko told thousands of supporters, who shouted ""glory, glory, glory"". Split from Russia Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait. The Ukrainian Orthodox church has been beholden to Moscow for hundreds of years, and Ukraine's leaders see church independence as vital to tackling Russian meddling. Kiev says Moscow-backed churches on its soil are a Kremlin tool to spread propaganda and support fighters in the Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The churches strongly deny this. New church leader The leader of the new church was chosen by a council that met at the St Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, built by the son of Prince Volodymyr whose baptism in 988 led to the spread of Christianity in the region. ""The question of autocephaly is a question of Ukrainian national security,"" Poroshenko had told the council earlier. ""This is a question of Ukrainian statehood. We acquire spiritual independence, which can be compared to the achievement of political independence. Break off the shackles, which bind us to the empire."" "

The World Bank has also announced a $750 billion loan guarantee. File photo of the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Christine Lagarde talking to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during their meeting at the IMF headquarters in Washington, US, June 20, 2017 The International Monetary Fund approved a new $3.9 billion stand-by aid agreement for Ukraine on Tuesday, intended to help the country maintain stability and the trust of investors as it heads into a choppy election period. The Finance Ministry said a first tranche of $1.4 billion should arrive by Dec. 25, and decisions on the next two tranches would come in May and November next year. Separately, the World Bank on Tuesday announced a $750 billion loan guarantee to help Ukraine raise an estimated $1 billion in debt on international markets. IMF aid had effectively been frozen since April 2017 due to Ukraine's stop-start efforts to implement reforms and tackle corruption as required by the IMF and other donors. The government reluctantly raised household gas tariffs in October, a potential vote-loser that was seized on by the opposition. Ukraine holds what are likely to be tight presidential and parliamentary elections next year, while fighting a conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014. The authorities imposed martial law in some parts of the country in November, citing the threat of a Russian invasion. The new IMF agreement spans 14 months and replaces a $17.5 billion programme that has propped up Ukraine since it plunged into turmoil following the 2014 Crimea annexation. ""The Fund's decision stands as an important display of recognition of our undeniable progress in macroeconomic stabilisation and confirmation of success in reforms,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said. The IMF said the programme would focus on four priorities, including fiscal consolidation, reducing inflation, strengthening the financial sector and pushing reforms. The prospect of securing more IMF loans has allowed the government, which must service a rising debt burden next year, to go to the market to issue new debt, and paved the way for the European Union and other foreign donors also to disburse aid. The World Bank approved a loan guarantee geared at pushing reforms and tackling corruption. ""Overall, the reform programme ... addresses structural bottlenecks and sends a signal to investors about Ukraine's ability to sustain reforms and address macroeconomic vulnerabilities ahead of the 2019 elections,"" said Satu Kahkonen, World Bank Country Director for Ukraine."

A pro-Russian separatist stands guard during the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic leadership and local parliamentary elections at a polling station in the settlement of Telmanovo, south from Donetsk on November 2, 2014. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine are set to hold elections in two self-proclaimed republics on Sunday, in an apparent bid to cement their split from the rest of the country. The elections in the Donetsk and Lugansk ""People's Republics,"" which have been outside of Kiev's control since 2014, have been strongly condemned by Kiev and the West. Kiev called on residents of eastern Ukraine to boycott the polls. While Ukraine takes positive steps to promote peace, Russia is stoking conflict by staging sham “elections.” Residents of eastern Ukraine should boycott these “elections,” which are not in line with either the Minsk agreements or Ukrainian law. 'Illegitimate election' Brussels earlier said the so-called presidential and parliamentary polls were contrary to a 2015 agreement aimed at settling the conflict. ""We expect Russia in particular to make full use of its influence on the separatists in this regard,"" the EU said in a statement in September. Eight European countries also condemned the ""illegitimate"" elections in a declaration at the United Nations last month, urging Russia to prevent them from going ahead. But Moscow has rejected the appeals, insisting the vote has ""nothing to do"" with the 2015 Minsk peace accord. 'Power vacuum' Residents of the region decided unilaterally to hold the elections, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in October. She said people there were living with ""permanent threats of the use of force by Ukrainian authorities."" ""The November 11 elections are dictated by the need to fill the power vacuum after the death of Alexander Zakharchenko,"" she said, referring to a separatist leader who was killed in a bombing at a Donetsk cafe in August. Denis Pushilin, a former negotiator with Kiev, is now acting leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic. Meanwhile, Leonid Pasechnik, the 48-year-old former regional chief of the Ukrainian security service, is acting leader of the neighbouring republic of Lugansk, also unrecognised internationally. ""Moscow has decided that the legitimisation of new leaders outweighs criticism by the West,"" Alexei Makarkin of the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies said. Separatists strengthen grip? The conflict between Ukrainian government forces and the separatists broke out in April 2014, shortly after Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and has since claimed more than 10,000 lives. Ukraine and the West accuse Moscow of militarily supporting separatists, claims that Russia denies despite overwhelming evidence. The polls are also a way for the separatists to strengthen their grip on nearly three percent of the Ukrainian mainland, political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said. ""If the elections were postponed, one could imagine these territories could come back under the control of the Ukrainian authorities one day,"" but that is far from being the case, Ukraine-based Fesenko said.  Russia behind election campaign  While several candidates are running in each of the two regions, the current acting leaders are almost certain to prevail. Pushilin was last month received in Moscow by President Vladimir Putin's influential advisor Vladislav Surkov, a Kremlin negotiator on Ukraine, Russian media reported. ""Moscow does not even bother to conceal that it is behind the election campaign in Donbass and that its winner is determined in advance,"" the Moscow-based Carnegie centre said in a note. ""Zakharchenko was not a totally independent figure, but Pushilin is being controlled even more"" by the Kremlin, it added. Unlike his predecessor, who was known for his belligerent remarks and loved strutting in camouflage uniform, Pushilin wears a formal suit in public rather than military attire. His election posters in Donetsk promise ""a peaceful republic for peaceful citizens."" Other posters encourage residents to vote for a region ""with a Russian heart,"" though the campaign has largely focused on social rather than military issues. The last separatist elections were held in late 2014 despite protests from the West and Kiev, which did not recognise their results."

Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine on Sunday hold elections after the assassination of a top rebel leader despite Western calls on Moscow not to sabotage peace talks. Washington and Brussels say the polls in the Donetsk and Lugansk ""People's Republics"" in Ukraine's industrial east will further hamper efforts to end a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Saturday the bloc considered polls ""illegal and illegitimate and will not recognise them."" ""These particular elections are a mockery,"" added the US special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker. ""It is something that we call on Russia to halt and not go forward with,"" he said this week, adding the vote contradicted Western-brokered peace agreements. The Kremlin has rejected the appeals, saying the vote has ""nothing to do"" with the accords. Moscow says the elections are necessary to fill the power vacuum after the leader of the Donetsk republic Alexander Zakharchenko was killed in a bombing at a Donetsk café in August. ""People simply need to live, get on with their lives and ensure order in the region under a blockade and permanent threats of the use of force by Ukrainian authorities,"" said Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and supported the outbreak of an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in what Kiev sees as punishment for its pivot to the West. While heavy fighting is over, the simmering conflict regularly claims the lives of soldiers and civilians. But negotiations are deadlocked and Western-backed peace accords agreed in 2015 are largely moribund. 'Hope has died' After Zakharchenko's killing Denis Pushilin, a 37-year-old former operator of the notorious Russian Ponzi scheme MMM, has become acting leader of the Donetsk republic and is expected to win polls there. Leonid Pasechnik, the 48-year-old former regional chief of the Ukrainian security service and acting leader of the neighbouring republic of Lugansk, is also expected to sail to victory. Both have promised to seek tighter ties with Moscow. Election posters around Donetsk urged people to vote ""with Russia in your heart."" But some locals say they have been disheartened, adding their opinions did not matter. ""Two global masters - the United States and Russia - are dividing territories,"" said Yury, a 50-year-old Donetsk resident, declining to release his surname. ""Hope has died, as they say,"" he told AFP. Lydia Bondar, a 76-year-old pensioner, said she was a fan of Zakharchenko and would vote for his successor Pushilin. Many analysts say the polls are a way for Moscow to strengthen its grip on around three percent of Ukrainian territory where around 3.7 million people live. Compared to Zakharchenko, Pushilin is considered by many observers to be a more convenient figure for Moscow. 'Ponzi scheme president' The first results of the polls are expected on Monday. The last separatist elections were held in 2014 despite protests from the West and Kiev, which did not recognise their results. Some pro-Kiev residents said they would not vote. ""This is ridiculous,"" said 34-year-old Tatyana, refusing to give her last name for fear of reprisals. ""The man who was involved in Ponzi schemes has been chosen to be our president. I am not going to vote, I would rather spend the day with my child."" Kiev's Western backers say that in order to help settle the bloodiest European conflict since the Balkans in the 1990s Russia should withdraw troops from eastern Ukraine and agree to a UN peacekeeping mission there. The Kremlin has denied funnelling troops and arms across the border."

The election commission members count ballots at polling station in Donetsk, in the rebel-held area of eastern Ukraine on November 11, 2018. Separatist leaders in Russian-backed areas of eastern Ukraine on Monday looked set for an expected victory according to preliminary results in polls condemned as illegal by Kiev and Western countries. Elections in the Donetsk and Lugansk ""People's Republics"", controlled by separatists since breaking away from Ukraine's pro-Western government in 2014, took place after the killing of the rebel Donetsk ""president"" in a bomb attack in August. Security was tight with gun-toting, camouflage-clad guards deployed to ensure order. ""Today we have proved to the world that we can not only fight, not only win on the battlefield but also build a state based on real democratic principles,"" Denis Pushilin, the 37-year-old acting Donetsk leader who is expected to win, told a crowd during a concert at the main square. In partial results that matched expectations, Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik, the acting Lugansk leader, were largely ahead with 57 percent and 70 percent respectively, with around a third of votes counted. Reactions to the vote French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel branded the vote ""illegal and illegitimate"" following a meeting with Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko on the sidelines of World War I commemorations also attended by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. ""These so-called elections undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,"" the pair said in a joint statement. Washington and Brussels had asked Russia not to allow the polls to go ahead, arguing they would further hamper efforts to end a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014. The people in eastern Ukraine will be better off within a unified Ukraine at peace rather than in a second-rate police state run by crooks and thugs, all subsidized by Russian taxpayers. ""The people in eastern Ukraine will be better off within a unified Ukraine at peace rather than in a second-rate police state run by crooks and thugs, all subsidised by Russian taxpayers,"" tweeted Kurt Volker, the US special envoy to Ukraine. Kiev urged the West to punish Russia for violating a 2015 peace agreement, while Poroshenko earlier called on east Ukrainians to snub the vote ""at gunpoint"". ""Russia is conducting fake elections in Donbass,"" Poroshenko said, referring to war-torn eastern Ukraine. Peace talks deadlocked  But Russia and local authorities rejected the criticism, saying residents in eastern Ukraine deserved a chance at a normal life and stressing that the turnout was high. ""There was mortar shelling again yesterday. I was even afraid of going to vote,"" Natalya, who declined to give her last name, told AFP at a polling station on the outskirts of Donetsk, a few kilometres from the frontlines. The 61-year-old retiree, who lives in a building with boarded-up windows, said all she wanted was peace and a better pension. Another voter, Lyudmila Sharakhina, said she wanted her rebel region to join Russia. ""Of course, we would like to become (part of) Russia, like Crimea did,"" the 60-year-old said at a polling station at a school that doubles as a bomb shelter. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and supported the outbreak of the insurgency in eastern Ukraine in what Kiev sees as punishment for its pivot to the West. While heavy fighting is over, the conflict regularly claims the lives of soldiers and civilians. Four Ukrainian soldiers died in recent days, Kiev said on Saturday. Peace negotiations have hit deadlock and Western-backed accords agreed in 2015 are largely moribund. Many analysts say the polls are a way for Moscow to strengthen its grip on around three percent of Ukrainian territory where 3.7 million people live. 'Russia has chosen'  Moscow, which denies funnelling troops and arms across the border, says the polls are necessary to fill the power vacuum after the assassination of rebel Donetsk leader Alexander Zakharchenko. While several candidates ran in each of the two regions, Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik were expected to win. Officials pulled out all the stops to encourage a high turnout, setting up food stalls near polling stations and offering lottery tickets to those who voted. Officials said more than 80 percent of eligible voters had cast their ballots in the Donetsk stronghold, while turnout stood at 77 percent in the Lugansk region at the close of polls. People also cast votes for local councillors but some voters said their opinions did not matter. ""Two global masters - the United States and Russia - are dividing territories,"" said Yury, a 50-year-old Donetsk resident, declining to give his surname. Vladimir, a 36-year-old customs broker, said he did not vote, adding that Pushilin would likely win in Donetsk. ""It appears that Russia has already chosen him,"" he told AFP, also declining to provide his surname. Kiev's Western backers say that in order to settle the conflict, Russia should withdraw troops from eastern Ukraine and agree to a UN peacekeeping mission.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/orthodox-independence-in-ukraine-whats-next-12711119,Orthodox independence in Ukraine: What's Next?,"The Ukraine Orthodox Church has a historic opportunity to gain independence from Moscow, whether it can grasp this opportunity is anyone's guess.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:31:25.337956,Ukraine War,TRT World,Ukraine,"The Ukraine Orthodox Church has a historic opportunity to gain independence from Moscow, whether it can grasp this opportunity is anyone's guess.  From recent media coverage of current developments in Ukrainian Orthodoxy, one might assume that the Moscow Patriarchate's affiliate in Ukraine is at the centre of the controversy around autocephaly. To be sure, it is implicated to a degree and it does run the risk of losing some members, who may choose to defect. But it is not the main driver towards autocephaly. Though some of the Russian Church's members may support more independent governance or even autonomy, Nikolay Mitrokhin of Bremen University has correctly observed that their numbers are not that large. Indeed, Ground Zero is found elsewhere. The key initiators of the current autocephalous movement are the two other Orthodox Churches in Ukraine. One is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under Kyiv Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko), who broke ties with Moscow in 1992, took the helm of the new church in 1995, and was excommunicated by Moscow two years later. The other is the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, established in 1920-21 through the controversial consecration of bishops by priests and a unilateral declaration of autocephaly. Excluded from communion with a patriarchal Church and worldwide Orthodoxy, both churches were isolated and operated in a kind of twilight zone. Legally registered in Ukraine, they were founding members of the country's Interreligious Council, but outcasts in the eyes of world Orthodoxy because Moscow considered their baptism invalid and shunned their members like heretics of a bygone age.   That changed on October 11, when, to the horror of the Moscow Patriarchate, Patriarch Bartholomew and his synod stood up to Patriarch Kirill and recognised these estimated ten million Orthodox Christians as legitimate. On the ground, it was business as usual for the Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox believers, who never gave a hoot about Moscow's canonical histrionics. But the symbolism of this step and the way it set the stage for autocephaly marks a historic shift inside Ukraine and far beyond its borders. The two churches now have canonical recognition, a regularisation of their status as Orthodox institutions. Their next goal is full-fledged autocephaly, and Patriarch Bartholomew spelled out the path: once they unite to form one church, their request will be granted. The Russian Orthodox Church Reacts The Russian Orthodox Church took this as an affront – interference in the internal affairs of its ""canonical territory."" But the Russian-Ukrainian conflict has severely eroded the credibility of that claim for both Ukrainians and Russian citizens of Ukraine. Over the past two decades, the Moscow Patriarchate invested much time and resources to construct the vision of a ""Russian world,"" a thinly-veiled restoration of the USSR, with Ukraine coming to its senses and returning to fold of the one, big, ""happy family."" But now, with autocephaly putting a monkey-wrench in that plan, it appears that the Russian Church had no Plan B. In announcing the Moscow Patriarchate's rupture with Constantinople on October 15, its head of external relations Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev) admitted that it had ""no other choice"". That was very telling. Closely aligned with the Putin regime, and with its liberal faction totally neutralised, the church was in no position to articulate a vision for the future apart from the larger geopolitical agenda. Since the beginning of the war in 2014, its discourse on Ukraine has consistently centred on the hegemonic power of the ""Russian world"" and the tacit hope that the land grabs that began in Ukrainian Crimea and Donbas would soon overtake the entire country. Then Russian Orthodox harmony and solidarity could be imposed, yet again, by force. But when the regime paused in its expansionist advance, the church was caught flat-footed, its discourse locked in the paradigm of geopolitical escapades. What can be expected next from the Russian Church?  In the foreseeable future, especially if the autocephalist project comes to fruition, the venting and raging will continue as long as there is ""no other choice"". Ultimately, time will tell who else will align with Moscow in its bid to force Patriarch Bartholomew to undo what he has done. Now the propaganda machine will have him in its sights, and fake news and media spin cannot be far behind. In fact, they may have already scored some points. Though Ukrainian autocephaly is not yet a fait accompli, international media have taken to equating the very notion of a unified Ukrainian Church with schism, which Christians consider to be one of the lowest forms of hubris. Now, since it is a basic principle of the neo-Soviet agenda to use religion to undermine Ukraine's independence, there can be little doubt that the formula ""Ukrainian autocephaly = schism"" comes from only one source – Moscow. The Promise and Challenges of Autocephaly in Ukraine   First of all, it is clear that time is of the essence. Historic opportunities for fundamental change present themselves only rarely. While ecclesiastical independence has been discussed frequently since Ukraine's independence in 1991, this is the first instance of the political will and the resolve of churches to pursue the goal.  The whole process that found its way to Constantinople was only possible because of an unprecedented convergence of circumstances and an alignment of political and religious priorities in Ukraine. All participants in this initiative are keenly aware that the window will not remain open indefinitely. The stakes are high and the die is cast. What difference can autocephaly make in Ukraine?  It would certainly put to rest numerous issues for Orthodox Christians in Ukraine. The canonical legitimacy that was declared in October would be confirmed and entrenched. It would enable the normalisation of relations with other Orthodox churches – except, predictably, for one hold-out to the north and any other satellites (Belarus, no doubt, and then perhaps the Church of Serbia), that might want to echo Moscow's protestations.  The crowning jewel of canonicity and autocephaly – the act of unification – would be an uplifting precedent at the very birth of a new church, hailed by Orthodox communities throughout the world, and no doubt by other Christians too. That said, autocephaly cannot realistically be expected to answer all questions and solve all problems. If a successful process of unification now depends on exemplary wisdom, selfless courage, and fortitude, those same virtues will have to go into overdrive once autocephaly becomes a fact. For one thing, the organisational, relational, and diplomatic challenges of constituting and consolidating the new institution will be staggering. For another, the temptation to pursue the pattern of a ""symphonic"" partnership with the state may prove irresistible, but it would have grave consequences for democratic and pluralist values. Autocephaly will raise as many, or perhaps even more questions than it answers. In itself, the new ecclesiastical status would not be a panacea in Ukraine. Even if all remaining hurdles are negotiated and the goal is achieved, the new Church will face formidable challenges.  Having won the title, it will need to become an authentic, autocephalous Orthodox Church in all its practical operations; having struggled for a path distinct from that of Russian Orthodoxy, it will need to resist the urge to replicate Soviet habits, such as the model of a state church; and having stood up for European integration and values, it will need to show resolve and not succumb to half-way measures. The new Church will have to face those challenges with wisdom. No less urgently, the present state of emergency, conflict, and crisis cry out for moral leadership with the courage to cut through all obstacles, to build bridges, and to bring peace. The new Church can be a constructive participant in that mission if it chooses. Very shortly after its establishment, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine will define its fundamental options, its vision, and long-term strategy – for better, or worse."

Defeated by a small-framed political freshman Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a 41-year-old comedian, producer and head of a successful production company who hails from a Russian-speaking family in Ukraine’s Russia-leaning east. His stance of an outsider free from affiliations with the widely distrusted and graft-addled political establishment was crucial, supporters say. “Ukrainians want changes, they don’t want to associate their future with corrupt politicians, and they want to see new politics modelled on honesty and a fight with corruption,” Serhiy Leshchenko, a lawmaker and anti-corruption activist who left Poroshenko’s party to join Zelenskiy’s team, told TRT World. Zelenskiy proved that life imitates art in the ex-Soviet nation devastated by Europe’s hottest armed conflict, Crimea’s annexation, a full-blown economic crisis and massive brain drain. In a popular TV series whose first season aired in 2015, he played a school teacher who is elected president against all political odds after his anti-establishment diatribe made him a YouTube star. In real life, Zelenskiy ran a taped-together campaign without a coherent programme or running mates. He gave only a handful of interviews, campaigned via online videos and satirical shows in jam-packed concert halls – and won the hearts and minds of millions throughout Ukraine. “He can change things at least a little bit, because politicians have only been thinking about themselves all these years,” Darya Mozgovaya, a 29-year-old bank teller in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, told TRT World. Poroshenkos’ supporters denounced Zelenskiy’s vague, populist message as stupefying bait designed to dupe the voters. “Poroshenko is a titan who will keep fighting to the end, but even he is not omnipotent in the fight with human stupidity,” political analyst Oleh Sharp wrote in his blog. Zelenskiy managed to get more than 30 percent of the March 31 vote, slightly more than his main rivals combined. Poroshenko was a distant second with 16 percent, and former premiere Yulia Tymoshenko was farther behind with 13 percent. Three dozen other hopefuls got the rest of the vote ending their parts in the most crowded election in Ukraine’s history.  Poroshenko and Zelenskiy will compete in the April 21 runoff, and it won’t just be a confrontation of a clownish David and a gloomy Goliath. Zelenskiy’s very likely victory may transcend Ukraine’s deepest political schism that has long played into the Kremlin’s hands. Most of his supporters initially were younger Ukrainians from eastern and southern provinces, which historically gravitate towards Russia, and analysts doubted whether they would actually show up at polling stations. They did, but the most surprising result of the vote was that Zelenskiy was widely backed by voters from western and central provinces, Poroshenko’s support base. Zelenskiy’s lead in 19 out of 24 regions (Crimea and separatist-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk did not take part in the vote) helped overcome Ukraine’s eternal political antagonism between Russian-speaking south and east and pro-Western, nationalist west and centre. Some observers say that the all-national victory stems from Zelenskiy’s lack of concise, coherent promises and a vague reformist agenda open to interpretation by opposing political camps. “He overcame [the divide] with his vagueness, we’re buying him now like a pig in a poke, we don’t understand his real views,” Kiev-based analyst Serhiy Pogrebinsky told TRT World. The antagonism is not set in stone or clearly defined borders, since millions of marriages in Ukraine are mixed, most of the population is bilingual, and ties with Russia are centuries old. The soft power of Russian culture and language is still strong – and doesn’t automatically translate into political allegiance to the Kremlin. “We hate Putin just as hard as any [ethnic] Ukrainian, and the fact that Russian is our mother tongue does not make us Moscow spies,” Valentina Karamysheva, a 41-year-old cook, told TRT World. Despite weeks of touring and an aggressive campaign that relied on patriotism, conservative nationalism and belligerent anti-Kremlin rhetoric, Poroshenko beat Zelenskiy only in three western regions, which only became part of Soviet Ukraine during World War II. The president lambasted Zelenskiy as a figurehead fielded by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, whose 1+1 television network airs Zelenskiy’s satirical shows that have for years satirised and ridiculed Ukraine’s political establishment. “Fate put me against a Kolomoisky’s puppet,” Poroshenko said on Sunday night after exit polls trumpeted his defeat. “We won't give Kolomoisky a chance.” However, he admitted that Zelenskiy’s success is to blame on his own mistakes. “This is a harsh lesson for me and our entire team,” Poroshenko said. “This is a serious reason to thoroughly correct the mistakes made in recent years.” His supporters credit him with restoring war-ravaged cities, rebuilding aged, Soviet-era infrastructure and strengthening Ukraine’s military. His miniscule approval ratings skyrocketed last year after he convinced Bartholomew, the Patriarch of Constantinople and the world’s most revered Orthodox Christian leader, to recognise a new Ukrainian church free from religious submission to Moscow. One of Ukraine’s wealthiest oligarchs, Poroshenko proclaimed an anti-corruption crusade during his election campaign in 2014. But while many bureaucratic hurdles have been simplified, top-level corruption has hardly been addressed.  In recent weeks, he was dogged by scandals that involved his team’s alleged attempt to buy millions of votes and his close friend’s affiliation with companies that reportedly supplied overpriced spare parts to Ukraine’s military that were smuggled from Russia. Far-right groups staged massive protests and tried to disrupt his campaign rallies and boo the president off the stage. But Poroshenko is not giving up – because even after losing the presidential vote his party may try to win in the October parliamentary election. Poroshenko’s team ""will try to radicalise the campaign,"" political analyst Andriy Zolotaryov wrote. ""They will repeat the mistakes they did in January and February when they started a campaign to defame Zelenskiy."""

Cardboard images of presidential candidates Volodymyr Zelensky, foreground, and Yulia Tymoshenko, right, on display in central Kiev, Ukraine, Thursday, March 28, 2019. Ukraine went to vote on a list of 39 candidates and showed the most trust in two names who will go on to compete in the second round of voting: comedian Volodymyr Zelensky and the incumbent president Petro Poroshenko.  The possibility of a Volodymyr Zelenky presidency is not an April Fool's joke anymore. But the question on remains: can he be a real “servant of the people”? The short answer is yes. Yes, there is a chance for Zelensky to bring honesty to the state apparatus finally. However, the long answer depends on various analyses and especially on hope which he instilled to the Ukrainian voters. A real servant of the people – that's been a Ukrainian dream for years. Civil servants and policymakers in Ukraine have been by many as corrupt officials who abuse their positions and out of touch with ordinary citizens. Those who voted for Zelensky feel that it is time to stop believing in the old guard of politics and pass the flag to the anti-establishment youth. There are a number of reasons for Zelensky's popularity in the eyes of the electorate. First of all, he is a comedian and smiles a lot. It seems trivial but should not be underestimated in a country plagued by war, corruption and an unstable economy. He also leads a comedy troupe, the 'Kvartal 95', and used the popularity of their stand-up shows to gather voters together. Even though some of the shows were free, like the massive display in Dnipro Stadium with thousands of attendees, people were happy to watch Zelensky campaign. Spending a few minutes to promote Zelensky’s campaign during the Kvartal 95 show was a creative solution to unencumber the masses from the routinely aggressive and ordinary political rallies of establishment candidates. Secondly, people have already seen him as president. No, he's never been president or held the Bulava – the ceremonial mace of power, however, he has played Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a character in the popular TV show 'Servant of the People' where an ordinary history teacher is elected president after a video of him speaking out against the corrupt establishment goes viral. Zelensky's character as an honest person who rejects presidential guards, the official residence and cars to continue his basic lifestyle resonates among Ukrainians. The people of Ukraine hold a belief that Zelensky in real life can portray the same honesty and finally bring transparency to Ukrainian politics. His TV commercials also reflected the notion of a “man of the people” with the slogan “I am ready!”. Zelensky is accused by many of lacking political experience. But I think that his inexperience gives him a huge edge and he was the only major candidate without past scandals.   He has no gas deal or bribery scandal to his name, nor any prior convictions that would violate the Ukrainian people's trust in him. He is accused of being a surrogate for the oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the TV station where Kvartal 95 comedies are aired, but influential journalists like Dmitry Gordon have rubbished those sorts of claims. April 21, the next phase of the election, will show whether Ukrainians genuinely believe in Zelensky. The comedian is a realist on the Russian issue and believes that the question must be solved in Moscow, but there is no way to solve the problem while Putin is in the office. His pragmatism has softened his light appeal because just like other candidates he outlined problems without providing solutions. Where the Ukrainians believe and hope that his honesty can be enough for him to gather the will to tackle corruption, it is only possible if he assembles a stellar team to surround himself in office. He currently campaigns with an experienced team of advisors. Volodymyr Zelensky has a chance to seize the moment and become a legend in modern Ukrainian politics. Five years ago, Poroshenko was in the same situation, but he squandered his opportunity and could not fulfil his promises. Zelensky can still show honesty and the character to do the people's bidding."

Ukraine's President and presidential candidate Petro Poroshenko attends a policy debate with his rival, comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at the National Sports Complex Olimpiyskiy stadium in Kiev, Ukraine April 19, 2019. A comedian who is the front-runner in Ukraine's presidential race and the incumbent fighting to retain his job traded accusations in a debate at a sports stadium Friday, just two days before the election. President Petro Poroshenko, who is trailing in opinion polls ahead of Sunday's presidential runoff, accused his rival, 41-year-old comic actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of lacking the political experience needed to keep Ukraine on its pro-Western course and resist Russia's attempts to draw the country back into its orbit. While Poroshenko charged that his rival lacks a clear program, Zelenskiy shot back, calling the president ""a wolf in sheep's clothing."" Zelenskiy, who is widely popular for playing a Ukrainian president fighting corruption in a popular TV sitcom, held the Ukrainian leader responsible for the nation's economic woes and endemic corruption. He insisted that he would continue pushing Ukraine to further integrate into the West. The debate was watched by some 60,000 people who packed the nation's largest sports arena in Kiev, backing their candidates with enthusiastic chants or booing their opponents. TRT World's Francis Collins reports. Zelenskiy tried to put Poroshenko on the defensive, showering the billionaire candy tycoon-turned-president with questions about his business assets and associates of his who have been accused of corruption. The actor said he voted for Poroshenko five years ago but later realized that ""I made a mistake, we made a mistake."" ""Could we imagine back then that a new way of life would in fact be a fight for survival?"" Zelenskiy said, referring to the country's sharp plunge in living standards since the 2014 vote. ""I'm not a politician, I'm a simple man who has come to break that system,"" he said, echoing his sitcom character, a schoolteacher suddenly thrust into the presidential seat. ""I'm the result of your promises and your mistakes."" Poroshenko shot back, arguing that the actor has failed to spell out his program and pointing at his business ties with self-exiled billionaire tycoon Ihor Kolomoyskyi, the president's archrival. Poroshenko charged that Zelenskiy's victory would benefit Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has backed separatist rebels in Ukraine's east ever since in fighting that has left 13,000 people dead. ""He would be a weak head of state unable to stand up to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" Poroshenko said. ""An actor can't wage a war against Russia."" Zelenskiy sought to turn the tables on Poroshenko, accusing him of maintaining backdoor channels with the Kremlin and continuing to market his candy in Russia despite the bitter tug-of-war between the two neighbors. ""I will uphold Ukraine's European choice,"" he insisted. At some point, both candidates came down to their knees to ask for forgiveness of those who lost their relatives in the five years of fighting in the east. Prior to the debate, Poroshenko rallied thousands of his supporters at the capital's Independence Square, which was the heart of Ukraine's 2014 opposition protests that ousted the nation's former Russia-friendly president. Lyudmila Soloveyko, a 56-year-old schoolteacher who went to the rally, said she's grateful to Poroshenko for ""opening the door to Europe for Ukrainians,"" referring to the EU decision to scrap visas for traveling Ukrainians, which Poroshenko had lobbied for. Zelenskiy has avoided a traditional political campaign, touring the country with his comedy show instead. In his rare interviews, he has pledged to continue the push for close ties with the EU and NATO but also spoke out for more active efforts to reintegrate the rebels in the east back into Ukraine's fold. Zelenskiy's supporters scoffed at the president's claim that the actor would be easy prey for the Kremlin and pointed at the economic woes and corruption during Poroshenko's time at the helm. ""We have got tired of the old politicians who are good at nothing but talk,"" said 54-year-old sales clerk Yevgenia Ostroshitskaya. ""Life only has been getting worse. Let Zelenskiy give it a try, he has done it well in the movies."" Zelenskiy won 30 percent of the vote in the March 31 first round vote while Poroshenko got 16percent, and the gap has widened as Sunday's runoff has approached. A poll released Thursday by the Rating agency suggested Zelenskiy has 58 percent support, while Poroshenko has just 22 percent. The poll of 3,000 people had a margin of error of 1.8 percentage points."

A member of a local electoral commission takes part in preparations for the upcoming presidential election at a polling station in Kiev, Ukraine April 20, 2019. Ukraine readied on Saturday for a change in leadership as a young comedian appeared set to crush his incumbent rival in presidential polls, delivering a stinging rebuke to the old elite. The 41-year-old TV star Volodymyr Zelensky's bid to lead Ukraine began as a long shot but all polls show him defeating President Petro Poroshenko in a second-round vote on Sunday. His victory would open a new chapter in the history of a country that has gone through two popular uprisings in two decades and is mired in a five-year conflict with Moscow-backed insurgents in the east. TRT World's Francis Collings reports from Kiev. Despite mounting uncertainty Ukrainians are fed up with corruption, poverty, and the war that has claimed some 13,000 lives over the past five years. ""There is a hope that a simple man will better understand us and dismantle the system that we have in our country,"" Yuliya Lykhota, 29, told AFP in Kiev. ""It is very important to raise our people's spirits."" Others said they doubted the political novice's ability to enact real change as Ukraine's sixth president. ""I do not believe he will last long once he's elected,"" said Sergiy Fedorets, 62. ""He has no support in parliament. He'll be eaten alive."" Francis Collings has more. Collective anxiety Poroshenko came to power after a bloody 2014 uprising ousted a Kremlin-backed regime, triggering Moscow's annexation of Crimea. But many in the country of 45 million people feel the promises of the uprising have not been fulfilled. Zelensky has capitalised on popular anger as well as his popularity as the star of the sitcom ""Servant of the People"", in which he plays a school teacher who becomes a president. Analysts say his political programme is vague at best and it remains unclear who will fill key positions in his government. Ahead of the vote a popular news website, Ukrainska Pravda, published an interview with a therapist who pointed to severe anxiety in the country. ""There is not a single person who would not be discussing the situation in the country,"" said Oleg Chaban. ""People are more tense because they are paying with their lives and expect real change quickly."" Poroshenko, 53, has fought hard to secure re-election but his pleas to forgive him for past mistakes and give him a second chance have fallen on deaf ears. A survey by the Rating pollster showed Zelensky winning 73 percent of the vote against 27 percent for Poroshenko. 'Neither comedy nor horror film' On Saturday, Poroshenko once again called on Ukrainians to think twice before casting ballots for his rival. ""A five-year presidential term is not a comedy that you can easily switch off if it is no longer funny,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Neither is it a horror movie that can be easily stopped."" The West has closely watched the race amid concern a new government might undo years of reforms it has backed. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called both Zelensky and Poroshenko on Friday. He ""reiterated our commitment to working with whomever the Ukrainian people choose to ensure the success of a secure, prosperous, democratic, & free (country),"" Washington's special envoy Kurt Volker said on Twitter. Secretary Pompeo called both candidates tonight to underscore 🇺🇸 support for Ukraine’s sovereignty & territorial integrity & reiterated our commitment to working with whomever the Ukrainian people choose to ensure the success of a secure, prosperous, democratic, & free 🇺🇦. On Friday, the two rivals traded insults in the first and only debate of the campaign at Kiev's 70,000-seater Olympic Stadium in front of thousands of spectators. Ukrainians said the head-to-head was more about political theatrics and a battle of wits than a much-needed policy debate. Zelensky accused Poroshenko – a tycoon who made a fortune in chocolate before taking office – of enriching himself and failing to end the war in the east. The Ukrainian leader attacked the inexperience of the untested Zelensky, questioning his ability to be a wartime commander-in-chief and saying he would not be able to stand up to Russia's Vladimir Putin. He also drew attention to Zelensky's ties to controversial tycoon Igor Kolomoysky. Supporters credit Poroshenko with rebuilding the army and securing an Orthodox Church independent of Russia but he won only just over half of Zelensky's vote share in the first round of the election last month."

Here are five facts about a country at war wanting transformational change. Ukrainian presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy (R) watches as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (L) gestures during their final electoral campaign debate at the Olympic stadium in Kiev, Ukraine on April 19, 2019. Ukrainians head to the polls on Sunday in the second round of an extraordinary election with a comedian who plays a president on TV expected to win in a stunning rebuke to the political establishment. Forty-one-year-old Volodymyr Zelensky's bid to lead the country of 45 million people was initially dismissed as a joke when he announced his candidacy on New Year's Eve. But now all opinion polls suggest incumbent President Petro Poroshenko is heading for defeat amid widespread anger over poverty, corruption and war. Zelensky's victory is expected to open a new chapter in the hi story of a country that has gone through two popular uprisings in two decades and is mired in a five-year conflict with separatists in the east. Polling stations opened at 0500 GMT as voters from Ukrainian-speaking regions in the west to Russian-speaking regions in the war-torn east went to cast their ballots. Here are five facts about a country that in recent years has been brought to the brink by uprisings, war and loss of territory. Russia ties ""Ukraine"" literally means ""on the edge"" and its history has been closely tied to that of its giant neighbour, Russia. Modern-day Russia and Ukraine are thought to share their origins in the ancient state of Kievan Rus, now the region around Kiev. Much of what is now Ukraine was part of the Tsarist Russian empire although the western regions belonged at different times to various neighbours, including the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The country later became part of the USSR. In the early decades of Soviet rule, it suffered during a devastating famine known as the Holodomor caused by Joseph Stalin's policies. Tensions between Kiev and Moscow have flared in the decades following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. After a pro-Western popular uprising led to the ouster of Russian-backed president Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula and supported separatists in the east of Ukraine. The conflict has so far cost around 13,000 lives. Economic trouble With the start of the 2014 crisis, the Ukrainian economy went into freefall. That year, GDP dropped by more than 6 percent, and the following year it fell almost 10 percent. In 2015, inflation hit more than 40 percent. The economy has since shown some signs of recovery but the country of 45 million people remains one of the poorest in Europe. An average monthly salary is $340 (300 euros), according to figures from the start of 2019. The country relies on transit fees for Russian gas towards Europe and Kiev has expressed concern it will be bypassed by new Russian energy projects. During disputes in 2006 and 2009, Moscow cut supplies to Ukraine during the winter, sparking knock-on shortages in Europe. Corruption  Corruption is endemic in Ukraine and all major candidates for the presidency have vowed to tackle it. The NGO Transparency International puts Ukraine at 120 out of 180 countries in terms of public perception of corruption -- better than its 2014 rating of 142, but well below its EU neighbours. According to a Gallup poll, just nine percent of Ukrainians have confidence in their government, the lowest in the world. There is public frustration at what is seen as an out-of-touch, corrupt political elite — which explains the meteoric rise of Zelensky. Anti-corruption campaigners regularly suffer physical attacks. Activists say they have recorded around 100 such attacks over the past four years. Chernobyl The world's worst nuclear accident took place in Ukraine on April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Thirty people were killed in an explosion and many hundreds died of related illnesses, though the exact figure remains disputed. Soviet authorities initially tried to cover up and play down the disaster. Eventually, 350,000 people were evacuated from within a 30-kilometre (19-mile) radius around the plant, an exclusion zone that remains uninhabited, apart from some 150 elderly residents who returned despite an official ban. Authorities now say it will only be safe for humans to live there again in 24,000 years. Borscht While some in the West think of borscht as synonymous with Russian cuisine, Ukraine claims the beetroot-based soup as part of its national heritage dating back to the 14th century. A number of other dishes are contested by Russia and Ukraine, including Chicken Kiev. Some versions of its history attribute the invention of the dish to a Russian chef."

Ukraine's President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy takes the oath during his inauguration ceremony in the parliament hall in Kiev May 20, 2019. Emboldened by his stunning victory last month, Ukrainian TV star Volodymyr Zelenskiy moved swiftly on Monday to dissolve the country’s parliament, moments after he was sworn in as the country’s new president.  Zelenskiy, who won 73 percent of the vote last month, justified his contentious decision to dissolve the parliament, which is controlled by allies of the man he defeated, Petro Poroshenko, on the grounds it has become a hotbed of self-enrichment.  A presidential decree formally disbanding the parliament is expected later on Monday. If all goes to plan, the snap election will be held within two months after the decree is signed.  Elections to the Supreme Rada were scheduled for Oct. 27, which raised the prospect of Zelenskiy struggling to enact his agenda in the face of a hostile parliament over his first few months in power.  Zelenskiy, who played the Ukrainian president on a popular TV show for years, is gambling that his popularity will see the next parliament dominated by supporters of his agenda to reform Ukraine and steer a new path with Russia.  ""People are tired of experienced... politicians who for 28 years have been building a country of opportunities,"" he said.  ""Opportunities for kickbacks, money laundering and corruption."" TRT World's
Sarah Morice has this report. Controversial move Zelenskiy’s surprise move is certainly controversial and follows repeated attempts by the majority in the current parliament to stymie his campaign promise for a snap election.  Since last month’s election, Zelenskiy’s opponents in the Rada sought to put off the inauguration close to the May 27 deadline by which the parliament can be dissolved.  And in a dramatic move last week, the Rada announced the collapse of the ruling parliamentary coalition. According to parliamentary rules, the chamber cannot be dissolved for 30 days after the governing coalition has been disbanded.  Zelenskiy’s supporters argue that the Rada’s actions are legally void because the coalition had long ceased to exist and that the Constitution, unlike the Rada regulations, does not contain such a rule.  Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kiev-based think-tank Penta, said Zelenskiy’s announcement shows ""political will for radical change."" ""The legally dubious decision to disband parliament will certainly be contested in court but Zelenskiy has shown that it is going to be him w ho will lay down the agenda and that he will dominate the political landscape,"" he said.  Zelenskiy’s landslide victory reflected Ukrainians’ exhaustion with widespread corruption and the country’s political elite. Before disbanding parliament, the 41-year-old Zelenskiy upended other Ukrainian political traditions on inauguration day. He ditched the idea of a traditional motorcade to his inauguration, walking to the parliament Kiev through a park packed with people. Flanked by four bodyguards, the beaming president-elect gave high-fives to some spectators, even stopping to take a selfie with one of them. At the end of his swearing-in ceremony Zelenskiy asked the Supreme Rada to adopt a bill against illegal enrichment and support his motions to fire the country’s defence minister, the head of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) and the Prosecutor General. All are allies of Poroshenko. That’s when he dropped his bombshell about dissolving parliament. Zelenskiy told lawmakers they only have a few weeks to support his motions as that’s as long as the current parliament has. Two of the three officials he has asked to leave, Defense Minister Stepan Polt orak and SBU chief Vasyl Grytsak, promptly handed in their resignations. Zelenskiy also told the Rada that the main goal for the presidency is to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, where government troops have been fighting Russia-backed separatists for five years in a conflict that has left at least 13,000 dead. ""I’m ready to do everything so that our heroes don’t die there,” he said. “It wasn’t us who started that war. But we need to be the one to finish it.""  The new president wrapped up his speech at parliament by referring to his career as a comedian. ""Throughout all of my life, I tried to do everything to make Ukrainians laugh,” he said with a smile. ""In the next five years I will do everything, Ukrainians, so that you don’t cry."""

Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, who was jailed on terrorism charges in Russia, hugs his relative upon arrival in Kiev, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attends a welcoming ceremony after Russia-Ukraine prisoner swap, at Borispil International Airport outside Kiev, Ukraine on September 7, 2019. Russia and Ukraine carried out a long-awaited swap of 70 prisoners on Saturday, in a deal hailed by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a ""first step"" towards ending their conflict. Planes carrying 35 prisoners from each side landed simultaneously in Moscow and Kiev, where relatives waiting at the airport broke into applause. ""We have taken the first step,"" Zelenskiy said on the tarmac after greeting and hugging former prisoners at the airport. ""We have to take all the steps to finish this horrible war."" Zelenskiy greeted the freed prisoners as they stepped down from the airplane that had brought them from Moscow to Kyiv's Boryspil airport. Relatives waiting on the tarmac surged forward to hug their loved ones. Most of the ex-detainees appeared to be in good physical condition, although one struggled down the steps on crutches and another was held by the arms as he slowly navigated the steps. Among those swapped were 24 Ukrainian sailors, Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov and Russian journalist Kyrylo Vyshynsky. Ukraine's SBU security service confirmed that Vladimir Tsemakh, a fighter with Russian-backed separatists considered a key witness in the downing of flight MH17, was also released as part of the swap. Dozens of lawmakers urged Ukraine's president not to make Tsemakh one of their country's 35 traded prisoners. Critics saw freeing Tsemakh as an act of submissiveness to Russia, but the exchange ""allows Zelenskiy to fulfil one of his main pre-election promises,"" Ukrainian analyst Vadim Karasev told The Associated Press. TRT World speaks to journalist Julia Chapman. Deep regret  The Netherlands said Saturday it had pressed Kiev in vain to drop the handover to Russia of Tsemakh.  The Dutch government contacted Ukraine ""several times and at the very highest level"" to prevent the handover of the suspected air defence specialist for pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine, Foreign Minister Stef Blok said in a letter to parliament. Blok added that he ""regretted"" Kiev's decision. Blok said authorities had had the opportunity to question Tsemakh, 58, before he left for Russia but the Netherlands still ""deeply regretted"" his handover. Piet Ploeg, chairman of the Dutch MH17 victim's foundation told AFP: ""Of course we're not happy with the transfer of Mr Tsemakh to Russia but we understand it's a very difficult dilemma for Ukraine."" It looks ""very suspicious,"" Ploeg said, adding that ""from our point of view, it's kind of obstruction from Russia."" The Malaysia Airlines passenger plane travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down by a Russian-made BUK missile in 2014 over eastern Ukraine, with the loss of all 298 people on board. TRT World speaks to Peter Zalmayev from the Eurasia Democracy Initiative. Kiev-Moscow relations Anticipation had been building for days for the exchange, which involved weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations. Relations between Kiev and Moscow nose-dived in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow backed separatists in the eastern industrial regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Fighting there has claimed more than 13,000 lives over the past five years. Zelenskiy's election in April has raised hopes that the stalled peace process could be revived. The comedian-turned-politician vowed during to campaign to have Ukrainian prisoners in Russia returned and has said ending the conflict with Russia is his top priority. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that the exchange would be ""a huge step towards normalising relations"" with Kiev. Sailors, filmmaker, journalist The release of Sentsov will be seen as a major victory for Kiev. The 43-year-old was Ukraine's most famous political prisoner and the subject of a star-studded international campaign calling for his release. He was arrested in 2014 and had been serving a 20-year sentence in an Arctic penal colony for planning ""terrorist attacks"" in Crimea. ""I thank all the people who have fought for us,"" Sentsov said at the airport in Kiev. The sailors, including two members of Ukraine's SBU security services, were detained last year when Russia seized three Ukrainian vessels off Crimea. Among those handed over to Russia was Vyshynsky, a journalist at Russia's RIA Novosti state news agency who was facing charges of ""high treason"" but was released on bail late last month. World leaders hail swap US President Donald Trump on Saturday congratulated Russia and Ukraine on the long-awaited prisoner swap.  ""Russia and Ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners.

From the left, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson attend a work session during the G7 summit at Casino in Biarritz, southwestern France.  August 26, 2019.  France on Monday issued a short statement at the end of a meeting of G7 leaders on several issues, but it was not a communique along the lines of those usually drawn up at the annual summit, reflecting divisions. The issues were trade, Iran, Libya, Ukraine and Hong Kong. The statement said the seven industrialised nations were committed to open and fair world trade and to global economic stability. It said they wanted significant changes to the World Trade Organization to make it more efficient in protecting intellectual property, resolving disputes more quickly and eradicating unfair trade practices. French President Emmanuel Macron said that the 3-day gathering of G7 leaders in southwest France came in under budget and was ""one of the least expensive"" Group of Seven summits ever. G7 world leaders are now looking ahead to what's next after the summit came to a close in Biarritz. Iran US President Donald Trump said on Monday he was prepared to meet his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani within weeks, after talks about Tehran's nuclear programme at the G7 summit in France. TRT World 's Simon McGregor-Wood brings more from Biarritz. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had made a surprise appearance on the sidelines of the summit in Biarritz on Sunday at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron. TRT World spoke to Tara Kangarlou, a journalist and expert on Iran, who explains why the Trump-Rouhani meeting would be significant. Brexit British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""marginally more optimistic"" on the chances of clinching a deal for Britain's exit from the EU after talks at the G7 this weekend, but acknowledged it would be difficult. But he added, ""It will be difficult ... there is a substantial disagreement"" between Britain and the EU. Johnson insisted that it was up to the EU to improve the chances of a deal but needed to negotiate a new agreement on leaving without the so-called ""backstop"" for Ireland. Ukraine Meanwhile, Macron said there will be a meeting next month on the Ukraine conflict with the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. He said it would be at the chief of state or government level but gave no details. However, Macron said the G7 leaders could not agree on whether to invite Russia back into the grouping of leading democracies. Trump said he could invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to next year's G7 summit, which he wants to hold in Miami. European officials said that's premature. The EU wants progress on peace accords for Ukraine first. Russia was kicked out of the then-G8 after annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Hong Kong The G7 leaders have backed Hong Kong's autonomy as laid out in a 1984 agreement between Britain and China and called for calm in the protest-hit city. ""The G7 reaffirms the existence and the importance of the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong and calls for avoiding violence,"" according to a joint statement issued in French at the end of a G7 meeting in Biarritz, southwest France. The city has been wracked by more than two months of protests over an attempt by its Beijing-backed government to pass an extradition bill, which opponents saw as a huge dent in Hong Kong's autonomy."

Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said on a visit to Ukraine that Turkey will help build housing for 500 families of Crimean Tatars who have relocated to other parts of Ukraine after Crimea's annexation. Speaking at a news conference after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Erdogan emphasised that ""Turkey doesn't recognise the illegitimate annexation of Crimea.""  ""Turkey supports Ukraine's territorial integrity,"" he said. Incarcerated Tatars Zelenskiy noted that Ukraine counts on Turkey to help win the release of Crimean Tatars arrested in occupied Crimea. Russian security forces in Crimea have arrested dozens of Crimean Tatars on charges of ties with militant groups — charges that rights activists have denounced as bogus. Zelenskiy also said that he and Erdogan discussed possible natural gas supplies to Ukraine via Turkey. Zelenskiy also extended condolences to Turkey over the death of five Turkish military personnel and three civilian contractors in Idlib, Syria in a regime attack.

Passengers' belongings are seen after the Ukraine International Airlines plane crashed after take-off from Iran's Imam Khomeini airport, on the outskirts of Tehran, Iran, January 8, 2020 US and other Western officials say that Iranian missiles brought down a Ukrainian airliner, which crashed near Tehran on Wednesday killing all 176 people on board. Iran, however, has disputed that explanation saying that while investigations continue, its preliminary suspicions are that the flight crashed after a mechanical failure. Officials in Washington said surveillance by intelligence services had picked up infrared flashes consistent with anti-aircraft missiles being launched and evidence that the plane was hit. The New York Times has separately published mobile phone video of what appears to be a missile striking the plane. Iran completely rejects the idea that it shot the plane down, and has called on the US to bring forth its evidence. The crash came hours after Iran launched ballistic missiles at US bases in Iraq after the assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad last week. Even though the US has suggested that the plane crash incident was “accidental”, there remain a number of questions for the Iranians and other investigators to answer. If it is confirmed, how was a civilian airliner mistakenly fired at? Anti-missile batteries are normally operated by trained personnel who are specialised in distinguishing civilian air traffic from military threats. There is nothing unusual about Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752’s takeoff pattern, according to analysts, and given its altitude, at the moment it got into difficulty, it would have been easily distinguishable as a civilian airliner with the most basic surveillance equipment. The flight got into difficulty just minutes after takeoff. If a missile was indeed the cause, to fire at an aircraft that soon after departure would suggest either an anti-missile system operating either autonomously, a rushed decision-making process, or a botched algorithm. Why were civilian flights not grounded? Iranian anti-aircraft units would have been on high alert after launching the missile barrage on US forces in Iraq. US retaliation, including missile attacks or air raids, would have been a real possibility. If a missile strike on Flight 752 is confirmed, Tehran will have to explain why civilian air traffic was allowed to operate as normal when there was the prospect of enemy aircraft sharing the same airspace. Why was the crash site cleared so fast? Determining the cause of the crash requires a detailed study of the impact zone, including the scatter patterns of debris. Sources at the scene on Friday, however, say that most of the area has been cleared of wreckage. Doing so may disrupt any ongoing investigation and lead to the disappearance of clues that may help determine the cause of the crash. The crash site of Ukraine International Airlines #PS752. While this may not show the entire site, it appears there’s very little left of the 737 jet pic.twitter.com/bM83MDY1GV What happens now with the investigation? With the US and Iran on the brink of war, and mutual suspicions plentiful, there has been an apparent reluctance among the Iranians to let manufacturer Boeing join the investigation. After initially refusing to hand over the plane’s black box to the company, Iran has said it will cooperate with both Boeing and the US."

The Tor-M1 anti-aircraft defence system is displayed in a military parade, to commemorate the anniversary of the start of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, in Tehran. September 22, 2009. Canada said on Thursday that a surface-to-air missile brought down a Ukraine International Airline's Boeing in Tehran on Wednesday, hours after Iranian missiles attacked US forces in Iraq.  The Ukrainian government said it was investigating reports of debris from a Russian-made Tor-M1 missile near the plane crash site. Here's what we know about a possible missile hitting Ukraine's plane: How high and how far? The Tor, also called the SA-15 Gauntlet by NATO, is a short-range “point defence” system that integrates the missile launcher and radar into a single tracked vehicle. It is designed to be mobile and lethal against targets at altitudes up to 6,000 metres and at ranges of 12 kilometres, according to the Federation of American Scientists, which researches and analyses “catastrophic threats to national and international security”. Can a commercial airliner avoid Tor? Military aircraft and cruise missiles –– which the Tor system is designed to destroy –– typically plot their courses to avoid being spotted on radar. They are equipped with systems such as chaff, which confuses radar, and flares, which act as decoys for heat-seeking missiles. The jet that crashed on Wednesday, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, a Boeing 737-800, would have filed a flight plan and had no defensive features. It was unlikely the flight crew had time to react to any missile, said Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. “They probably wouldn’t have even seen it coming,” Duitsman said. “Right after takeoff, the pilots were probably preoccupied with other things.” Can a Tor system identify commercial planes? To attack a target, the Tor operator must identify it on the radar screen and direct the missile to launch. Commercial air flights have transponders –– radio transmitters that broadcast their identity, speed and altitude at an internationally agreed frequency.  There were several other civilian aircraft nearby when Flight 752 crashed just a few kilometres from the airport. All of those aircraft would have been visible on the radar screen of the Tor battery as well as civilian radar at the airport. A former European air defence officer, who now works on missile defence technology, said that ideally, flight plans and transponder codes of all scheduled civilian flights would be shared with military units stationed near an airport. That allows the missile battery operator to correlate each object on the radar with a flight plan and transponder code. “Shooting down a hostile aircraft is easy,” said the officer, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. “It’s identifying the aircraft and not shooting down friendlies that are the challenges.” How fast and powerful is a Tor missile? Tor missiles are guided by radar and fly at almost three times the speed of sound. That means that if launched at a target 5 km (3 miles) away, they will arrive within about five seconds. They have a small warhead –– about 15 kg (33 lb) of high explosive –– but are designed to spray fragments of shredded metal, like bullets, into a target upon detonation. The Tor is among the most modern air defence systems Iran has, Duitsman said and can attack two targets at once with up to two missiles each.  When Iran purchased them from Russia in the mid-2000s, “the capability was such that at the time the US was concerned about the sale”, he added. Iran fields “small numbers” of Tor systems, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report last year. What does the video footage show? A US official told Reuters that data showed the plane was airborne for two minutes when the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected. That was quickly followed by an explosion in the vicinity of the plane, the official said.  At least one video circulating on Twitter from the night of the crash shows a burning aircraft crashing into the ground near Tehran. The New York Times said it verified the video that appeared to show a missile hitting Ukraine International Airlines plane near Tehran airport. Iran denied that the airliner had been hit by a missile. Riki Ellison, a defence expert and founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said it would have been impossible to divert the missiles after launch, even if the ground operators realised their error. “Once you shoot those things, it’s over,” Ellison said."

Iran ""accidentally"" shot down a Ukraine airliner that crashed in
Iran, killing all 176 people aboard, three US officials told
Reuters on Thursday. Citing an extensive review of satellite data, one official
said the government had concluded with a high degree of
certainty that Iranian anti-aircraft missiles brought down the
plane. The officials said the plane had been tracked by Iranian
radar before the missiles were fired. The data showed the Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing
737-800 bound for Kiev was airborne for two minutes after
departing Tehran when the heat signatures of two surface-to-air
missiles were detected, one of the officials said. That was quickly followed by an explosion in the vicinity of
the plane, this official said. Heat signature data then showed
the plane on fire as it went down. Newsweek, CBS, and CNN, also cited unnamed officials, saying that satellite, radar and electronic data indicated the tragic error, which followed a ballistic missile barrage by Iran on two military bases in Iraq where US troops work. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, ""There is now a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface to air missile."" The New York Times posted a video Thursday it said it had verified showing the moment the apparent missile struck the plane over Iran. The video shows a fast-moving object rising before a fiery explosion. An object, apparently on fire, then continues in a different direction. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the downing, said in Toronto: “We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.” The Iranian government, in a statement, urged Canada to share its information after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said ""multiple"" intelligence sources indicate that Iran shot down the Boeing airliner.  Iran's foreign ministry also invited the US planemaker Boeing to ""participate"" in its inquiry into the crash. Iran denies 'illogical rumours' The head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation on Thursday denied ""illogical rumours"" that a Ukrainian airliner that crashed near Tehran had been hit by a missile, the semi-official news agency ISNA reported.  ""Scientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane, and such rumours are illogical,"" ISNA quoted Ali Abedzadeh as saying. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday the deadly
crash could have been a mistake and he did not believe it was a
mechanical issue. Speaking at the White House, Trump categorically denied the crash was due to US action, insisting instead that he has ""suspicions"" about the ""tragic"" incident. ""Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side,"" Trump said, referring to Iran. ""Some people say it was mechanical. I don't think that's even a question personally."" The three officials said Washington believed the downing of
the plane was an accident.  It occurred shortly after Iran had
fired missiles at two US military bases in Iraq and Iranians
were on high alert for a US military response. An Iranian report on Thursday cited witnesses on the ground
and in a passing aircraft flying at a high altitude as saying
the plane was on fire while in the air. Boeing declines to comment Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration declined to
comment on Thursday, as did the Pentagon. Ukrainian officials
had no immediate comment. Boeing is still reeling from two deadly crashes of 737 MAX
planes in five months that led to the plane's grounding in March
2019. The 737-800 that crashed was built in 2016 and is the
prior generation of the 737 before the MAX.  Boeing has built
about 5,000 of those planes, which has a good safety record. Boeing shares rose 1.7 percent on Thursday. Ukraine calls for 'evidence' in plane crash probeUkraine asked Western nations to provide any evidence they may have to help investigators probing the crash. ""Our country has every interest in establishing the truth. That is why we are calling on Ukraine's Western partners: If you have evidence to assist the inquiry, we call on you to provide it,"" the Ukraine presidency said in a statement. Canada demands role in probe Ottawa called on Thursday for its own experts to be allowed to join the investigation into the crash of an airliner near Tehran that killed dozens of Canadian citizens of Iranian origin. In a rare phone call with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif late Wednesday, Canada's Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne called for Iran to allow Canadian investigators into the country, the Canadian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""Minister Champagne stressed the need for Canadian officials to be quickly granted access to Iran to provide consular services, help with identification of the deceased and take part in the investigation of the crash,"" the statement said. Champagne told Zarif that ""Canada and Canadians have many questions which will need to be answered."" Such direct contact is rare since Canada broke off diplomatic ties in 2012 in protest at Tehran's support for the Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad."

The project is part of Moscow's efforts to reduce shipments via Ukraine. Russian President Putin (centre left), Turkish President Erdogan (centre right), Bulgarian Prime Minister Borisov (far left) and Serbia's President Vucic attend the ceremony, marking the formal launch of the TurkStream pipeline, in Istanbul, Turkey on January 8, 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated a new gas pipeline linking their countries, at a ceremony in Istanbul on Wednesday with tensions over Libya and Syria also on the agenda. Erdogan described the Turkstream pipelines — which will deliver Russian gas to Turkey and Europe via the Black Sea — as a ""project of historic importance"" for relations between their countries. Turkey did not allow divergence in opinions with Russia to derail common interests, Erdogan also said. During his speech, Erdogan ruled out any project in the Eastern Mediterranean excluding Turkey. ""There is no chance of realising any project in the Eastern Mediterranean that excludes our country …,"" he said. Last week, Greece, Israel, and the Greek Cypriot Administration signed a controversial deal for the EastMed project to build a 1,900-km natural gas pipeline that will run from Israel through Southern Cyprus, Crete, Greece and ultimately to Italy, a plan Turkey says is bound to fail. The pipeline was a sign of ""interaction and cooperation for the benefit of our people and the people of all Europe, the whole world,"" Putin said at the inauguration ceremony. ""I am sure that in the future Russia and Turkey will implement many more mutually beneficial projects both in energy and other areas,"" he said. There are tendencies to raise tensions in the region but Turkey and Russia aim at the opposite, the Russian president stressed. Putin arrived late on Tuesday after paying a surprise visit to Syria — his first to Damascus since the war began — at a moment of acute uncertainty in the Middle East following the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by the United States. TurkStream and the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic allow Russia to increase gas supplies to Europe without having to rely on Ukraine. But Moscow's increasing domination of European energy markets has worried the United States, which last month sanctioned firms working on TurkStream and the almost-completed Nord Stream 2. Bilateral ties The ceremony in Istanbul reflected a dramatic improvement in ties between Russia and Turkey with both sides hailing the cooperation. Turkey and Russia have established a regular dialogue over the Syrian conflict, despite being on opposing sides, but now find their relations tested again in Libya. Last week, Turkey sent its first troops to help defend the UN-backed Tripoli government, which is under siege from warlord Khalifa Haftar. Erdogan has underlined that the deployment remains small for now: only 35 soldiers and limited to training and coordination roles, according to comments carried in the Hurriyet newspaper. He has criticised the presence of 2,500 Russian mercenaries supporting Haftar — claims denied by Moscow. Russia so far seems unfazed by the Turkish deployment in Libya, said Mariana Belenkaia, of the Carnegie Centre in Moscow. ""The two countries will likely be tempted to share the Libyan burden,"" she said. Powder-keg Syria Syria remains a potential powder keg for Erdogan and Putin's relationship. Syrian regime forces — backed by Russia — have ramped up bombardment of the last opposition strongholds in Idlib province in recent weeks, sending hundreds of thousands fleeing towards the Turkish border. Erdogan has called for a ceasefire in Idlib, following previous temporary halts to the fighting brokered with Russia in late 2018 and updated in August last year. Improved ties between the two countries have been facilitated by a number of major energy and defence deals.  Russia is building Turkey's first nuclear plant and last year delivered the S-400 missile defence system, to the consternation of Turkey's NATO allies. Putin earned goodwill in Turkey after his quick support for Erdogan following an attempted coup in July 2016. The two men have developed a ""strong personal relationship,"" according to Jana Jabbour of Sciences Po university in Paris, who adds that ""their economic and energy plans are interdependent."" TurkStream project The TurkStream project, which was temporarily halted during a frosty patch in Russia-Turkey relations, includes two parallel pipelines of more than 900 kilometres. The pipeline links Anapa in Russia to Kiyikoy in northwestern Turkey and has already begun deliveries to Bulgaria. It is being extended towards Serbia, Hungary and Austria. The pipeline has a total capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres, out of which the first line will carry 15.75 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Turkish consumers. The second line will carry another 15.75 billion cubic metres of gas to Europe via Turkey. BOTAS built the first line that will connect to Turkey’s existing gas grid, while the second line, to be operated by a Gazprom-BOTAS joint venture, will stretch to the Turkish-European border in Turkey's Thrace region."

Gazprom logo is seen on a gas processing column under construction at Amur gas processing plant, part of Power Of Siberia project outside the far eastern town of Svobodny, in Amur region, Russia November 29, 2019. Russia's state-owned energy company Gazprom paid on Friday $2.9 billion natural gas compensation to Naftogaz, the national oil and gas company of Ukraine. ""Naftogaz of Ukraine has confirmed receipt of $2.918 billion in compensation from Gazprom in compliance with the 2018 Stockholm Arbitration's award. Thus, in total, based on the results of the [gas] transit arbitration, Naftogaz received $5 billion from Gazprom,"" the company said in a statement. The amount paid by Gazprom included payments of the awarded compensation, which was $2.56 billion, and interest accumulated after the announcement of the decision February 28, 2018. ""Naftogaz welcomes the recognition by the Russian side of the need to comply with the 2017-2018 arbitration awards and its intention to continue transporting gas to the EU through Ukraine. The parties continue negotiations on the terms of further cooperation after the current contract [with Gazprom] expires on January 1, 2020,"" it said. In 2014, Gazprom and Naftogaz went to an arbitration court in Stockholm for a gas transit contract, where a lawsuit was ruled in favor of the Ukrainian company. Following months of tense talks and ahead of the looming 10-year gas transit contract deadline, the two ex-Soviet countries last week signed a protocol of agreements on the continuation of transit of Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine. On December 20, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement “in principle” on a new gas transit contract, but negotiations on the details will continue, officials said. The two companies are expected to sign a five-year Moscow-Kiev gas agreement before the end of 2019. Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula after a controversial referendum. Turkey, as well as the UN General Assembly, view the annexation as illegal. Ukraine also blames the Kremlin for separatist violence in Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine that borders Russia."

Men walk before reuniting with servicemen and officials of the self-proclaimed republics during the exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) between Ukraine and the separatist republics near the Mayorsk crossing point in Donetsk region, Ukraine on December 29, 2019. Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists in the country's war-torn east exchanged 200 prisoners on Sunday, swapping detained fighters for civilians and servicemen held captive in some cases for years in two breakaway regions. Kiev handed over to separatists five riot policemen suspected of killing protesters during a pro-Western uprising in 2014 as part of the swap, sparking public outrage. ""The mutual release of the detainees has ended,"" the Ukrainian presidential office said in a statement on Facebook, adding that it would provide more details later. The presidency said Kiev received 76 captives, while separatist officials said the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics took in a total of 124. The head of the Lugansk stronghold, Leonid Pasechnik, congratulated his people on a new ""victory"" ahead of the New Year's festivities. The exchange came after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy held their first face-to-face talks in Paris on December 9 and agreed measures to de-escalate Europe's only active war. Prisoners filed off coaches at the Mayorske checkpoint in the eastern Donetsk region, many carrying plastic bags stuffed with their belongings, as gun-toting uniformed soldiers and ambulances were on standby. Among the group of detainees handed over by the separatists were those who said they had been held for several years after getting caught up in the conflict while visiting relatives. Volodymyr Danylchenko, who said he had spent three years in captivity, said he was at a loss for words. ""I myself don't understand what's happened,"" said the 36-year-old, adding that he was leaving his mother behind in the separatist region of Lugansk. Bittersweet homecoming Another detainee released by the separatists, who gave just her first name Victoria, said she had been held for three years. ""I am so happy,"" the 24-year-old told AFP, adding that she had been convicted of ""state treason"" and sentenced to 12 years in prison after arriving in the Lugansk region to see her parents. Another woman being handed to Kiev sported a handwritten sign on her clothing: ""My country is Ukraine!"" The swap, which was overseen by monitors from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, came three months after Ukraine carried out a long-awaited exchange with Russia of 35 prisoners each. The previous prisoner swap between Kiev and separatists took place in 2017. Ties between Ukraine and Russia were shredded after the bloody 2014 uprising ousted a Kremlin-backed regime. Moscow went on to annex Crimea and support insurgents in eastern Ukraine who launched a bid for independence in 2014. Since then more than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict. 'No future' The release of the riot police has raised concerns in Ukraine, with many fearing the country is being pushed to pay too high a price for the swap. Ahead of the exchange three riot policemen were released from custody while another two were freed from house arrest. The riot policemen are suspected to have been involved in the bloody crackdown on protesters in 2014. Some 100 demonstrators were shot dead during the uprising. ""What Ukrainians have been fighting for is going down the drain,"" filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was released in the September prisoner exchange, said on Facebook. In an open letter to Zelenskiy, the victims' families warned that the release of the suspects could lead to a ""wave of protests"". Volodymyr Golodnyuk, whose 19-year son was killed in the uprising, accused authorities of ""abusing the justice system"". ""This country has no future,"" he said. In an apparent move to allay concerns, Ukraine's prosecutor-general's office said the trial of the five former policemen would continue. 'Frozen' conflict Since coming to power in May, comedian-turned-president Zelenskiy, 41, has sought to kickstart a peace process to end the conflict. At the Paris summit, the leaders sought to revive accords signed in Minsk in 2015 that call for the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the restoration of Kiev's control over its borders, among other conditions. But many doubt whether Putin genuinely wants to settle the conflict. He has said that if Kiev gets back control of the border in the east, residents of separatist-held territories could be targeted. Zelenskiy's peace plan has also been strongly criticised by war veterans and nationalists. Dmitri Trenin, head of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, praised the prisoner exchange but said it would not bring a settlement any closer."

Ukrainian troops' frontline positions have been generally static for more than a year. The Ukrainian army and Moscow-backed separatists said on Tuesday they had begun to withdraw their troops from a key area in the war-torn east ahead of a high-stakes summit with Russia. The long-awaited pullback is a precondition for the first face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to be mediated by the leaders of France and Germany. ""The process of troop withdrawal began by both sides ... in the area of Zolote-4"" in the Lugansk region, Ukraine's army said on Facebook. Vladislav Deinego, a representative of the separatist self-proclaimed Lugansk republic, also said the withdrawal in the area had begun. Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe confirmed the move. ""Today the sides have just resumed the withdrawal of troops and arms in Zolote,"" Martin Sajdik, an OSCE special representative, told journalists. The rival forces also need to withdraw troops from the village of Petrivske in the Donetsk region for the high-profile summit to go ahead. Since coming to power in May, comedian-turned-president Zelenskiy has sought to revive a peace process to end a five-year-old separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine that has claimed some 13,000 lives. But those efforts have stalled as the Kiev forces and the Kremlin-backed separatists have repeatedly failed to pull back troops from the frontline because of exchanges of gunfire. Zelenskiy's peace plan, including the troop pullback, has been strongly criticised by many in Kiev, especially war veterans and nationalists. Over the past few weeks, thousands of Ukrainians, including Zelenskiy's predecessor Petro Poroshenko, protested in the capital Kiev and other cities, slamming a pullback of troops as an act of ""surrender."" Nationalists are set to hold a new protest rally outside Zelenskiy's offices on Tuesday. Various nationalist organisations even deployed their own troops to Zolote in an effort to prevent a retreat of Ukrainian forces. Last week the 41-year-old Ukrainian president was forced to personally travel to Zolote in an effort to convince his nationalist critics not to stand in the way of the peace process. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said it was important for Zelenskiy to ""make"" nationalists carry out his orders. Political enemies were quick to criticise Zelenskiy on Tuesday. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, a lawmaker from Poroshenko's party, called the troop withdrawal a ""capitulation on the Kremlin's conditions."" In the run-up to the planned summit, Ukrainian, Russian and separatist negotiators also agreed on a roadmap that envisages a special status for the separatist territories if they conduct free and fair elections under the Ukrainian constitution. Critics say the proposal favours Russia, but Zelenskiy has pledged not to betray Ukraine's interests. Ties between Ukraine and Russia were shredded after a bloody uprising ousted a Kremlin-backed regime in 2014. Moscow went on to annex Crimea and support insurgents in eastern Ukraine."

President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the InterContinental Barclay New York hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019, in New York. Ukraine is dominating the news and for all the wrong reasons. The ongoing impeachment drama in the United States threatens to turn the issue of US support to Ukraine from a bipartisan issue to one that becomes intimately linked to Washington’s toxic politics. Not since Russia’s invasion in 2014 has Ukraine been mentioned so much in US media. And with all the talk about Ukraine in the unfolding political drama, we should not lose sight of the bigger picture: Ukraine is a country at war with soldiers dying every week. Five years on, with Ukraine featuring so much in the news, it is worth remembering what happened. When the Kremlin-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych failed to sign an association agreement with the European Union in 2013, months of street demonstrations led to his ouster in early 2014.  Russia responded by violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sending troops, aided by pro-Russian local militia, to occupy the Crimean peninsula under the pretext of “protecting Russian people.” This led to Russia’s eventual annexation of Crimea. Russia’s annexation of Crimea is unprecedented in the 21st century. The annexation has de facto cut Ukraine’s coastline in half and has essentially turned the Black Sea into a Russian-controlled lake.  Russia has since claimed rights to underwater resources off the Crimean peninsula previously belonging to Ukraine. Furthermore, Russia has launched a campaign of persecution and intimidation of the ethnic Tatar community there. In addition to the exploits in Crimea, Moscow took advantage of political grievances held by the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east to stoke sectarian divisions. In eastern Ukraine, Russia and Russian-backed separatists continue to propagate a war that has resulted in more than 13, 000 lives lost, and more than twice that wounded. Ukraine now has an internally displaced population of almost 1.8 million people, and the Russian occupation and subsequent war have inflicted substantial damage to the Ukrainian economy. It has also slowed Ukraine’s progress toward deepening ties in the transatlantic community. Five years later we shouldn’t forget that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. Russia illegally occupies Crimea. Russia provoked and now supports a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine that did not previously exist. Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the victim. One should not forget that Russia’s actions in Ukraine were started when Kyiv sought an Association Agreement with the EU. This is why modern Ukraine represents the idea in Europe that each country has the sovereign ability to determine its path and to decide with whom it has relations and how, and by whom it is governed.  No outside actor (in this case Russia) should have a veto on membership or closer relations with organisations like the European Union or NATO. In many ways, the future viability of the transatlantic community will be decided in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine where the fighting has been taking place. Decisive action At the NATO Leaders Meeting in London next week, the alliance must speak with a clear and united voice. NATO must continue to present a unified voice against Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, reiterating the need for a complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Even with the ongoing fighting, there have been small but encouraging signs of Ukrainian-Russian dialogue. Newly elected Ukrainian president and actor turned politician, Volodymyr Zelensky campaigned on a pledge to bring the war in eastern Ukraine to a peaceful and acceptable end. Russia recently returned the Ukrainian ships it had illegally taken almost a year ago (although, it should be noted the returned ships had almost everything from inside stripped out ).  A recent prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia led to the release of 24 sailors that were captured with their ships last year, along with the release of Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov. In December there will be a meeting under the so-called Normandy Format which will bring France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia around the negotiating table again. The last time a meeting of the Normandy Format took place was 2016. The driving force behind this meeting has been French President Emmanuel Macron, who has raised eyebrows recently by suggesting that Europe needs a new approach with Russia. It must be pointed out that expectations are low for an end to the conflict. The occupation in Crimea and the Russian backed war in the Donbas give Russia influence into the region which it will not quickly give up. In terms of overall international aid for Ukraine, Europe has contributed many times more than the US, contrary to what President Trump claims. However, when it comes to military assistance alone, the US is the biggest contributor.   America has provided military training and non-lethal military equipment such as radars and radios. It has also provided lethal weapons to the Ukrainians such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, retired US Coast Guard ships, and sniper rifles. US policymakers understand the importance of Ukraine’s struggle. This is why there was such outrage when President Trump unexpectedly threatened to withhold military assistance late last summer.  Thankfully, the aid was provided in the end. As the impeachment process unfolds in the US, more light is being shed on this decision to withhold the funding. Americans, Europeans, Ukrainians, and Russians will be watching closely. Ukraine is in the midst of a national struggle that will determine its future geopolitical orientation: the West or Russia. The outcome of this struggle will have long-term implications for the transatlantic community and the notion of national sovereignty. It would be a shame if American support for Ukraine became the casualty of the ongoing impeachment process in the US."

Top officials from 46 countries and blocs are taking part in a summit to discuss the issue of Russia's Crimea annexation in 2014. Ukraine's president has vowed to do all he can to bring back the peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Russia seven years ago, and urged international allies to support the effort. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke at the Crimean Platform summit in Kiev on Monday, called by Ukraine to build up pressure on Russia over the 2014 annexation that has been denounced as illegal by most of the world. Russia's relations with the West have sunk to post-Cold War lows as a result. In his opening remarks, Zelenskyy promised to ""do everything possible to return Crimea, so that Crimea, together with Ukraine, becomes part of Europe.” “For this we will use all possible political, legal and first and foremost diplomatic means,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that Kiev needs “effective support at the international level.” Top officials from 46 countries and blocs took part in the summit in person or online, including from the United States, the European Union and Turkey.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denounced the summit as an “anti-Russian event.” Zelenskyy charged that Russia has turned Crimea into a “military base"" and ""a foothold for Russia to boost its influence on the Black Sea region.” He said Moscow has tripled its military presence in Crimea. Turkey supports Ukraine's territorial integrity Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in his remarks that the international community should speak in one voice against Crimea’s annexation. Ankara strongly supports the ""territorial integrity"" of Ukraine.  ""Unfortunately, the international system, including the UN mechanism, is not well designed to resolve Crimea problem ... and this summit marks a start to achieving a lasting solution,"" Cavusoglu said.

How Putin continues Stalinist push to Russify, militarise Crimea In April, Russia increased troops near its borders with Ukraine, including in Crimea, eliciting international outrage. On June 23, Russia said one of its warships in the Black Sea fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of the HMS Defender, a British Royal Navy destroyer, to chase it away from an area near Crimea that Moscow claims as its territorial waters.  Britain, which like most other nations didn’t recognise the annexation of Crimea, insisted the Defender wasn’t fired upon and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters. All 30 NATO member states were represented at the summit. “Occupation of Crimea casts doubts on the effectiveness of the entire international security system,” Ukraine's president said.  “Without restoring the trust in it, not a single state can be sure that it wouldn't become the next victim of occupation.” Leaders of the Crimean Tatar community attended the summit. The summit was opened by a Ukrainian singer of Crimean Tatar descent, Susana Dzhamaladinova, known as Jamala “We need to show the world that ethnocide of Crimean Tatars continues in Crimea,”Jamala told The Associated Press.  “People in the world should know that we're barred from congregating even for honouring our ancestors.” Ethnic Russians, who form a majority of Crimea’s 2.3 million people, widely supported the Russian annexation, but Crimean Tatars, who accounted for nearly 15 percent, opposed it. An estimated 30,000 Crimean Tatars have fled Crimea since 2014. Some who stayed have faced a crackdown by Russian authorities, who banned the Crimean Tatars’ main representative body and some religious groups. About 80 Crimean Tatars have been convicted and 15 activists have gone missing, according to Amnesty International. ""Ukraine will never be alone in that Crimea is Ukraine,"" EU Council President Charles Michel said. ""Unfortunately, Russia continues to act in ways that multiply the negative impact of the annexation. The continued militarisation of the peninsula heavily affects the security situation in the Black Sea region."" READ MORE: Ukraine calls Russia's gas pipeline 'dangerous geopolitical weapon'"

US President Joe Biden(R) meets with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office of the White House, on September 1, 2021, in Washington, DC President Joe Biden assured Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday that the United States opposes ""Russian aggression"" but he showed no sign of moving on requests to open NATO to the eastern European country. ""The United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and our support for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" Biden told the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office. Zelensky, who spent Tuesday at the Pentagon pressing for military assistance to combat Russia and Russian-backed separatists, is only the second European leader to get a White House meeting so far under Biden. READ MORE: Ukraine-US Black Sea military drills raise hackles in Russia The coronavirus pandemic and a hectic first seven months of the administration mean Biden has had few foreign visitors. Even Zelensky's meeting was delayed by two days due to the tense US withdrawal from Afghanistan, completed on Monday. ""President Zelensky and Ukraine have gotten as much, if not more, attention from this administration than any other European country,"" a senior Biden administration official told reporters, asking not to be identified. The White House visit was undoubtedly a triumph for Zelensky, who has been trying to line one up since he took office in 2019. A former comedian virtually unknown in the West, he found himself caught in a US domestic political firestorm when then-president Donald Trump asked him to launch a spurious corruption probe into Biden's family ahead of the 2020 US presidential election. Accusations that Trump tried to block military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky sparked an impeachment of the Republican. Plea to join NATO The hard reality facing Zelensky, however, is that his most ambitious goals for the US-Ukrainian relationship face slow going. In the Oval Office, he raised his government's top strategic dream — membership in the NATO military alliance. ""I would like to discuss with President Biden his vision, his government's vision of Ukraine's chances to join NATO and the timeframe,"" he said. But Biden has made clear he considers Ukraine far from ready to join — and the United States far from ready to step over what Russia sees as a bright red line. READ MORE: Russia warns US, NATO against Ukraine troop deployment White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki insisted the White House continues ""to support and we continue to call for ensuring that NATO's door remains open to aspirants."" However, she then enumerated the daunting conditions for membership: rule of law reforms, defense sector modernisation and a vibrant economy. ""There are steps that Ukraine needs to take. They're very familiar with these,"" she said. Zelensky has also been hugely disappointed by Biden's decision to waive US sanctions intended to block completion of Russian state energy behemoth Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. But Zelensky later told reporters Biden had assured him the US would impose sanctions on the pipeline if there were ""violations"" from Russia after the start of Nord Stream 2 operations that would create problems for Ukraine's energy security. The White House says it remains concerned by the geostrategic implications of the pipeline, which will funnel energy directly from Russia to Germany, bypassing the previous route through Ukraine. However, Biden argued the project had already been nearly finished by the time he got into office and could not be stopped. The limitations on the relationship were neatly illustrated in June, when Zelensky's bid to meet with Biden first before the US leader held a June summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva was rejected. Anti-tank missiles Focusing on more concrete, near-term deliverables, Zelensky met Tuesday with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to request help in Ukraine's unequal struggle with Russia. Their talks came the day after the last US troops left Afghanistan, ending America's longest-ever war after the nearly 20-year-old US-backed Afghan government collapsed to the Taliban. READ MORE: Will the US now take on Russian military contractor, Wagner Group?

""I am pleased to see that the list of countries implementing a system based on the EU Digital Covid Certificate is growing steadily and we are setting standards internationally,"" EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said. ""This will help to facilitate safe travel, also beyond the borders of our Union."" The decisions, however, carry a caveat where it comes to vaccinations.

Ukraine's vaccine portfolio has those four -- but also one from China's Sinovac. Turkey and North Macedonia both administer Sinovac and another Chinese one, from Sinopharm, as well as Russia's Sputnik V, also not recognised by the EU scheme, alongside BioNTech/Pfizer and AstraZeneca shots. The EU already has an equivalence agreement with non-member Switzerland and has been working for some time to set up a mutually recognised system with the United States, so far with little progress. It does not have an equivalence decision with former member Britain, although many EU countries have unilaterally extended recognition to its certificate to ease entry for fully vaccinated bearers."

The $12-billion pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea is set to double Russian natural gas shipments to Germany. It avoids Ukraine, depriving Kiev of essential gas transit fees. Kiev sees the soon-to-be completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying Russian gas to Europe and bypassing Ukraine as ""a dangerous geopolitical weapon"", President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. The Ukrainian leader was speaking on Sunday at a joint press conference in Kiev with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spearheaded the pipeline fiercely opposed by Russian neighbours Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states. The $12-billion pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea is set to double Russian natural gas shipments to Germany, Europe's largest economy. It avoids Ukraine, depriving Kiev of essential gas transit fees. ""We view this project exclusively through the prism of security and consider it a dangerous geopolitical weapon of the Kremlin,"" Zelenskiy said. He added that the main risks after its completion will be ""borne by Ukraine"" but that the pipeline will also be dangerous ""for all of Europe"". The pipeline ""will only play into the hands of the Russian Federation,"" he said. For her part, Merkel said Berlin agrees with Washington that ""gas must not be used as a geopolitical weapon"".  ""It will come down to if there is an extension to the transit contract via Ukraine –– the sooner the better,"" she said, referring to the expiry of Moscow's agreement with Kiev in 2024. Merkel says she understands Zelenskiy's concerns The German leader, who met with Zelenskiy two days after visiting his Russian counterpart in Moscow, said she had discussed with Vladimir Putin extending the contract past 2024. ""We feel a special responsibility"" and ""understand the big concerns that President Zelenskiy expressed,"" she said. ""We take them very seriously.""   Zelensky said he and Merkel had discussed the extension, but noted that he so far had heard only ""very general things"". Tensions with US The construction of the pipeline led to tensions between Germany and the United States, but Washington eventually waived sanctions against the Russian-controlled builder of the pipeline. Merkel said the Germany-US agreement specifies ""sanctions"" if gas is ""used as a weapon"". She added that these commitments were ""binding on future German governments"", as she is set to leave office next month after 16 years in power. Merkel has been a key ally of Ukraine since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and pro-Russia separatists broke away from the country's east. But the German chancellor has frustrated Ukrainian authorities by opposing sending arms to Kiev and pushing across the finish line the Nord Steam 2 pipeline.

And she played a crucial role in clinching the Minsk peace accords in 2015, which helped halt the fiercest clashes. But many in Ukraine think the deal, which assumes some autonomy for the breakaway parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, was unfavourable for Kiev and is difficult to fulfill.

A Ukrainian soldier was killed and another seriously wounded in artillery fire from Russia-backed separatist rebels, according to Kiev’s military, as hostilities rise sharply in the country’s east. As of the reported attack, Ukraine says 27 soldiers have been killed in the east this year, more than half the number who died in all of 2020. Attacks have intensified in recent weeks and Russia has built up troops along the Ukraine border. Russia denies Western claims that it has sent troops into eastern Ukraine to help the rebels, but officials say the army could intervene if Ukraine tries to retake the area by force. The troops buildup has raised sharp concerns in the West. READ MORE:
Erdogan urges 'peaceful and diplomatic' solution to Ukraine-Russia tensions US warns of 'consequences' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned in an interview Sunday of ""consequences"" if Russia acts ""aggressively"" towards Ukraine, amid rising alarm over a Russian troop build-up on the border of the former Soviet republic. ""I have to tell you I have real concerns about Russia's actions on the borders of Ukraine,"" Blinken told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""That's why we're in very close contact, in close coordination, with our allies and partners in Europe. All of us share that concern."" ""President Biden's been very clear about this. If Russia acts recklessly, or aggressively, there will be costs, there will be consequences,"" Blinken said. In recent weeks fighting has intensified between Ukraine's army and pro-Russian separatists in the country's east, with signs of a Russian troop build-up in the region raising concerns of major escalation in the long-running conflict. Ukraine has accused Russia of amassing thousands of military personnel on its northern and eastern borders as well as on the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements, said Sunday it was not moving towards war with Ukraine - but also that it ""will not remain indifferent"" to the fate of Russian speakers in the conflict-torn region. The White House this week said the number of Russian troops at the border with Ukraine was now greater than at any time since 2014, when the conflict erupted after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. The conflict in Ukraine's east has claimed more than 13,000 lives and turned into a nagging problem in Moscow's relations with the West. Fighting has subsided in the past few years but a diplomatic solution to settle the eastern regions' status has stayed out of reach. Crimea is still recognized as part of Ukraine by the United Nations, and Kiev vows to one day win it back. Biden, who previously oversaw Washington's policies on Ukraine, is viewed as a strong ally by Ukrainians and his top diplomat Blinken, in talks this week with his French and German counterparts, agreed on supporting Ukraine against ""Russian provocations"".

Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Monday, April 5, 2021. Recently, the Biden administration has been facing a growing challenge thanks to Russia's armed provocations in Eastern Ukraine.  President Biden and his team had a phone call with their Ukrainian counterparts and sent the message that their unwavering support was with Ukraine.  Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said, ""We are discussing our concerns about that increase in tensions and ceasefire violations and regional tensions with NATO allies.""  Similarly, an emergency warning was given to the US Force Command in Europe. As it is known, the armed conflicts between the pro-Russian separatists who declared ""independence"" in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine and the Kiev administration have been ongoing since 2014.  More than 13,000 people were killed in the conflict to date according to the United Nations. As you may recall, the Trilateral Contact Group, consisting of Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is facilitating the negotiations regarding the Donbas crisis. The comprehensive ceasefire was established between the parties in July 2020 has been frequently violated as of late. It is most likely that all parties will try to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through diplomacy, and it's unlikely that the US will establish close military contact with Russia.  American experts on Ukraine that  I spoke to stated that this time, US representatives are on the field in Eastern Ukraine and they travel when needed. The reason for this is that during the Obama administration, these expeditions were not allowed.  I had a chance to speak with the Former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Dan Herbst, regarding the tension between Ukraine and Russia. Here is what he has told me: "" The Biden administration moved smartly this past week with phone calls from the whole national security team to Kiev expressing support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s military buildup in northern Crimea and along Ukraine’s eastern border. This was a timely warning to Moscow not to escalate its aggression against Ukraine."" If one pays close attention, it's clear that the US is more active with transition and deployment in the Black Sea and is constantly conducting exercises there. Apart from that, the Americans are adequately prepared to resist Russia's disinformation. Russian propaganda in Eastern Ukraine is pushing the false narrative that Ukraine will invade this region - it is clear that Russia is trying to sow confusion in Ukrainian territory. Currently, the US does not have an ambassador in Ukraine, so it is expected that a US ambassador and a special envoy will be appointed to Kiev in the near future. If we look at the point reached in Crimea over the last seven years, it's quite a painful situation. The Russians have entirely occupied the Crimean peninsula, which is a strategic geographical location in the Black Sea region, and Crimean Tatars and Ukrainian activists have been either imprisoned or deported by the Russian invaders.  So far, 50,000 Crimeans have been expelled from Crimea under the hybrid deportation strategy. Ukraine has begun to follow an increasingly active foreign policy regarding Crimea over the past six months. It has planned to welcome the representatives of more than 100 countries on the established Crimea Platform in Kiev in the summer months. On March 30, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Emmanuel Macron held a virtual meeting and discussed the latest developments in Eastern Ukraine.  While Putin said that Kiev increased tensions in the region by ignoring the ceasefire, Kiev and the West stated that Putin violated the ceasefire. Frankly, Europe's pressure on Putin is essential here, but it should not be forgotten that some European countries have important trade agreements with Russia. It is clear that the mistakes made regarding Crimea under the presidency of Barack Obama will not be repeated in the eastern region of Ukraine. The US is more active in the field, and the territory won't be left empty to Russia. US military aid to Ukraine that started in 2017, will both increase and become more active in the field in terms of intelligence. We also need to watch the position Turkey takes. Turkey opposes Russian hegemony in Crimea but at the same time does not want to break off its relations with Russia.  Ukraine's geopolitical position stands on a severe rupture line for Russia. Russia aims to restore its territorial integrity and possess a consistent route in the east-west direction. For Russia, Ukraine is a gateway to Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Russia is deeply concerned about Ukraine completely sliding towards the West and joining NATO. Putin has pulled every type of string to spoil the game in the Caucasus. NATO and the European Union should give utterance to the fact that they are paying attention to Russia's provocations in the region. The tension between the US and Russia has become a flashpoint for East-West polarisation - and this emerging development has different dimensions; such as the future of Crimea, the security of the Black Sea, and the sovereignty of Georgia and Ukraine, which concerns many countries, including Turkey."

The United States will send two warships to the Black Sea next week, Turkey has said as Russia, which has beefed up its military forces near Ukraine, accused non-coastal NATO powers of increasing naval activity in the region. Washington says Russia has amassed more troops on Ukraine's eastern border than at any time since 2014, when it annexed Crimea from Ukraine and backed pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""dangerous provocative actions"" in its eastern Donbass region in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kremlin said on Friday. Violence has flared between Ukrainian troops and the separatists, spurring fears of a major escalation.  Turkey, a NATO ally, said the United States would deploy two warships to the Black Sea from April 14-15. ""A notice was sent to us 15 days ago via diplomatic channels that two US warships would pass to the Black Sea, in line with the Montreux Convention. The ships will remain in the Black Sea until May 4,"" Turkey's Foreign Ministry said.

Turkey supports Ukraine's territorial integrity over Donbass, Crimea Russian troop build-up Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of sending in troops and weapons to help separatists, accusations that Moscow has denied.  Western and Ukrainian officials have raised concerns in recent weeks about increasingly frequent cease-fire violations in the country’s industrial heartland, known as Donbass. They also expressed worries about the Russian troop buildup along the border with Ukraine. During a call with Putin on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel “called for the removal of these troop reinforcements in order to achieve a de-escalation of the situation.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday the US is also increasingly worried about the Russian troop buildup, noting that Russia now has more troops on the border with Ukraine than at any time since 2014. In response, Peskov said Russia is free to deploy its troops wherever it wants on its territory. He accused the Ukrainian military of an “escalation of provocative actions” along the line of control in the east that threatens Russia's security. “The Kremlin has fears that a civil war could resume in Ukraine. And if a civil war, a full-scale military action, resumes near our borders that would threaten the Russian Federation's security,” Peskov said. “The ongoing escalation of tensions is quite unprecedented.” In Kyiv, Colonel-General Ruslan Khomchak, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, rejected Moscow's claims of the alleged Ukrainian preparations for an offensive in the east as part of a “disinformation campaign” and a “hybrid war.” Dmitry Kozak, a Putin aide who serves as Russia’s top negotiator with Kyiv, warned Ukraine on Thursday against using force to retake control of the east, where many residents have Russian citizenship. Such a move would mark “the beginning of an end for Ukraine,” he said, adding that Russia would likely act to protect its citizens. Asked about Kozak’s comment, Peskov alleged that virulent nationalist rhetoric in Ukraine was inflaming hatred against the mostly Russian-speaking population of the east. He claimed that if civilians in eastern Ukraine faced the threat of a massacre, “all countries, including Russia, will take steps to prevent such tragedies.” READ MORE: Can Ukraine join NATO when it’s under Russian threat?

Such visits by the US and other NATO ships have vexed Moscow, which long has bristled at Ukraine's efforts to build up defence ties with the West and its aspirations to eventually join NATO. According to a Reuters witness who keeps track of ships passing through Turkey's Bosphorus strait, the United States and NATO increased their presence in the Black Sea early this year, when US President Joe Biden's administration took power. The Reuters witness said the level had reached that seen in 2014-2015 at the time of the Crimea annexation.  Zelenskiy is due to meet Erdogan in Turkey on Saturday on a previously scheduled visit.  Ukraine rules out offensive Ukraine's army said it would not launch an offensive against pro-Russian separatists controlling two regions in the east. ""The liberation of the temporarily occupied territories by force will inevitably lead to the death of a large number of civilians and casualties among the military, which is unacceptable for Ukraine,"" Ruslan Khomchak, chief of the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said in a statement on Friday. He accused Moscow of using ""intimidation and blackmail by military force"" to exacerbate the situation. ""Ukraine is supported by the entire civilised world.

She added that Moscow was concerned about ""financial and logistical support of the Ukrainian armed forces by NATO countries"", as well as the alliance supplying lethal weapons and Western instructors training Ukrainian military personnel. Analysts have been split over Russia's true intentions amid the latest escalation in tensions with Kiev, and some observers say Moscow may be testing US President Joe Biden's commitment to defend Ukraine.

Ukraine's military said on Tuesday that two soldiers were shot dead on Monday after separatists opened fire on their positions with machine guns and grenade launchers. The first incident took place near the city of Avdiivka, six kilometres (four miles) north of Donetsk, the separatists' de facto capital, and the second near the town of Zolote-4 in Lugansk region, the military's press service told AFP. Ukraine's ground forces meanwhile announced 10 days of exercises for 600 reservists in the south of the country, aimed in particular at ""protecting the administrative border with Crimea"" and ""landing-accessible parts of the coast"". The conflict broke out in 2014 following Moscow's annexation of Crimea and has since claimed more than 13,000 lives. Fighting had subsided before the recent outbreak of violence, with a ceasefire agreed last year having seen clashes drop to their lowest level in years. Moscow and Kiev have accused each other of being behind the renewed clashes. READ MORE: Ukraine, Russia's other forgotten conflict"

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would be forced to respond if the US sent troops to Ukraine. ""There is no doubt such a scenario would lead to a further increase in tensions close to Russia's borders. Of course, this would call for additional measures from the Russian side to ensure its security,"" Peskov told reporters.

The so-called heads of the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation, also known as FETO, of two major cities in Iraq have been brought to Turkey from Ukraine, the Turkish Interior Ministry has announced. In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that Salih Fidan and Samet Gure, who are the terror group's chiefs in Baghdad and Erbil, respectively, were arrested while trying to illegally traverse the Ukraine-Poland border. A Turkish court had issued arrest warrants for both men over their suspected membership in FETO, the group behind the 2016 defeated coup, the statement added. The suspects are currently in the capital Ankara, where they are being processed at the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office. According to the statement, Fidan played a role in the organisation's overseas activities and was a teacher at a FETO-linked university in Iraq. Fidan had departed from Turkey with his wife just after the July 15 coup attempt and had not returned since, it added. Gure also actively served the terror organisation outside Turkey while working as a physics teacher at another education institution in Erbil, also linked to FETO.

US President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally in Washington, January 6, 2021 In January, demonstrators stormed an American federal facility. The protesters were able to mill about in the lobby area and ransacked the offices inside. While the protesters were ordered to leave, the brazen nature of the breach caused alarm in Washington. I am not writing about the protesters who stormed the US Capitol building on 6 January.  I am writing about Iraqi demonstrators, affiliated with the Iranian-aligned militia Kataib Hizballah, who stormed the US embassy in Baghdad’s Green Zone, but left on New Year day 2020.  In response to the protesters storming the American embassy, Trump ordered a drone strike thereafter that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, as well as Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, an Iraqi Popular Mobilization Unit (PMU) commander and leader of the aforementioned Iraqi militia.  It is ironic that Trump responded to the breach of the US embassy with an assassination almost exactly a year ago, yet encouraged demonstrators to storm the Capitol in a similar fashion.   Comparing the two events has significance today, as the storming of the embassy led to a series of escalatory events that resulted in the downing of a Ukrainian civilian airliner and the death of 176 passengers, on 8 January 2020, exactly a year ago.  Trump bears responsibility in both events.  Simply stated, my argument is that Trump bears responsibility for the downing of a Ukrainian airliner over Iranian airspace as a result of him leaving the Iran nuclear deal.  Prelude to Soleimani’s assassination Trump’s decision to pull out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the “Iran deal,” and imposing sanctions on Iran, led to the Islamic Republic retaliating by manipulating Iraqi militias to undermine American influence there. Iraq’s militias began launching rocket attacks against the US embassy and its forces on Iraqi military bases as of the summer of 2019.  A spiral of violence began on 27 December 2019 when the militia attacked the al-Taji base, where an American contractor was killed.  In a tweet, Trump wrote: “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will.”  What Trump failed to mention was the contractor was an Iraqi-American Muslim and an immigrant, Nawres Waleed Hamid. He was a translator for American forces in Iraq. Most likely Trump was even unaware of this.  Two days later, the US responded with an air raid on several targets related to the Iraqi militia, which resulted in the death of at least 25 members of the Kataib Hizballah. On 31 December, Iraqi demonstrators stormed the US embassy to protest that air raid.  Soleimani’s assassination Trump has no problem ordering protesters to seize a US government building, as long as they are his supporters. However, a year ago, Trump reeled from imagery that was reminiscent of the 1979 hostage crisis in Iran, and lashed out on 3 January 2020, ordering a drone strike against Soleimani and Muhandis.  In a single pre-dawn raid, Trump enraged both Iraqi and Iranian nationalist sentiments and turned their ire away towards Washington. Iraqis MPs demanded an American withdrawal from their country and the Islamic Republic was bound to retaliate.  Tehran responded on 8 January by launching 22 Fateh ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases housing American forces. No one was killed.  The downing of Flight 752 Fearing American retaliation, Iranian air defense commanders outside of Tehran mistook the Ukrainian airlines flight that had just taken off for a hostile, incoming attack aircraft, and fired a missile that brought it down, resulting in the death of 176 passengers, primarily Iranian civilians. The downing of the airliner on 8 January was the fault of Iran’s military, yet the causal process that led to this accident began because of Trump’s ego and his obsession with negating the policies of his predecessor Barrack Obama and his diplomatic triumph, the Iran deal.    After the government misled the public about the cause of the downing of the airliner, Iranians took to the street to communicate their anger at this deception.  Trump cheered these protests, by tweeting: “To the brave and suffering Iranian people: I have stood with you since the beginning of my presidency and my government will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely. Your courage is inspiring.”  Then Trump cynically attempted to take advantage of the protests on the streets of Tehran. In act of desperation, he did so again, not in a foreign capital, but in Washington DC itself.  Trump’s desperate gambit failed. The confirmation of the Biden victory finally offers hope of Washington reentering the nuclear deal and undoing the event that led to the tragedy that occurred exactly a year ago. "

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday said Turkey will not “turn its back” on the Palestinian cause or people, adding that Ankara will share ""all means available"" for ending the occupation and establishing peace. Erdogan made the remarks during his meeting with the visiting Palestinian members of the Israeli parliament in Istanbul. He thanked the Knesset members for their service of representing the Palestinian will in Israel’s legislative body against Tel Aviv’s “oppression” in Gaza as well as its ""Jewish State"" law and ""baseless rhetoric"" against Turkey. Erdogan further encouraged the group to work in unity and solidarity, saying that the controversial law defining Israel as a Jewish state was in open disregard of Palestinian citizen rights. The legislation also promotes Hebrew as the only official language, stripping Arabic as an official language while recognizing its ""special status"" in the country with a ""united Jerusalem"" as its capital. The law risks further alienating the Arab minority who argue they already face discrimination from Israeli Jews and the government and already feel as though they are second-class citizens. Palestinians, who have Israeli citizenship make up 21 percent of the population, are known as Israeli Arabs and have members in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset."

The former Tunisian president, Moncef Marzouki, has accused Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel of “creating chaos” in a number of Arab countries as part of their effort to counter the 2011 revolutions.  Marzouki, who led an interim government from 2011 to 2014, told TRT World that both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi coordinated efforts with Tel Aviv “to destroy everything related to the Arab revolutions”. “This Israeli-Emirati-Saudi coordination [...] was successful to an extent in creating chaos in Yemen; chaos in Libya; chaos in Syria; and the coup in Egypt. And in Tunisia, through corrupt money and corrupt media. “And [they] were able to get rid of me because I was a symbol of this revolution or the first president to come to power through this revolution,” he told TRT World.  The revolutions - better known as the ‘Arab Spring’ -  were a wave of pro-democracy protests which successfully toppled authoritarian leaders in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen.   Marzouki, who was elected by the Constituent Assembly following the fall of autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, pointed out that the Arab Spring’s success in overthrowing Arab autocrats caused the governments of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to let out a “cry of panic”, expressing fear “that this wave could reach (them)”.  According to Marzouki, such fears led the two countries to coordinate with Israel to “strike these revolutions”.   “I think this happened in coordination with the Israelis because (Israel) opposed having a great country like Egypt go out of control,” said Marzouki.  Countering the wave In February 2011, the wave of protests reached Bahrain, a small Gulf kingdom neighbouring Saudi Arabia.  The protests, mostly led by the country’s Shia opposition - Bahrain’s majority Muslim sect - attempted to emulate demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt against the kingdom’s Sunni ruling family.  As a response, a military force mostly comprised of Saudi and UAE troops entered Bahrain a month later to quell the protests, in an effort backed by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - a regional alliance made up of six Arab Gulf monarchies.  In an effort to also ensure that protests didn’t destabilise other Arab kingdoms, aid packages were announced in late 2011 for Jordan and Morocco by the GCC. Jordan’s King Abdullahfired the prime minister and his cabinet in February 2011, following mass demonstrations across the country.  Two years later, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE announced billions in aid to help Egypt stabilise its economy, days after the military overthrew Mohamed Morsi - the country’s first democratically elected president.   “It’s all connected,” said Marzouki. “It’s a battle between an old system wanting to maintain its authority … and nations wanting to restore their dignity, freedom and independence.”  Today, as waves of anti-government protests sweep across Sudan, Marzouki has called on Sudanese President Omar al Bashir to step down.  “I advise him on stepping down and leaving peacefully,” he said.  “In the end he has no option. After 30 years, it’s enough what he did and he should leave.”   UAE: The ‘Arab world’s policeman’  Since leaving office, Marzouki has openly criticised the UAE, previously accusing it of “unleashing terrorism” on Tunisia.  He believes the UAE’s “interference” goes beyond Tunisia, accusing the wealthy Gulf state of intervening in Arab countries on behalf of other powers who have “tasked” the UAE with the role of the “Arab world’s policeman”. “Who funds Haftar in Libya? The Emirates. Who is trying to separate southern Yemen?” he asked, referring to the UAE’s political and financial backing of a Yemeni separatist movement.  Marzouki doesn't believe that the UAE constructs its foreign policy in the Arab region independently, but rather has “orders” from what he referred to as “their masters” in Israel and the West. During his time in office, Marzouki said he reached out to American officials in an attempt to curb what he saw as UAE interference in his government’s affairs.  “There was no response in this case. We sent it and never received a response to this analysis … either directly or indirectly,” he said.  In 2016, the UAE’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, responded by tweeting scathing criticism of Marzouki, saying his “attack on the Emirates is in keeping with his habitually trivial and unbalanced political conduct”.    Concerns over election-rigging  After leading Tunisia for three years, Marzouki lost his country’s first presidential election in December 2014 to Baji Caid Essebsi, a former official in Ben Ali’s government and someone seen as a member of the ‘old guard’.  Marzouki said that Essebi’s platform promised “economic and social solutions” after he accused Marzouki’s government at the time of failing to grow the economy.  “This is what they told the people … Now it’s clear that they were all fake promises because there is debt aggravation and a collapse of the dinar day after day,” Marzouki said.  In November 2018, the Tunisian government faced major public pressure as roughly 650,000 civil servants went on a general strike, reportedly the country’s largest in five years. Another nationwide strike was called earlier this month.  Marzouki, an ardent critic of the current government, believes that the upcoming elections, expected later this year, will lead to a “card reshuffle”.  “There is no way that people suffering daily from rising prices, and of a critical situation, [are going] to re-invest their trust in those who lied to them,” he said. He also raised concerns over the possibility of election rigging in the upcoming elections. When asked about who would commit such actions, Marzouki referred to the current regime, saying it was mostly composed of the old guard. “The old regime was raised on rigging elections,” he said. “Baji Caid Essebsi boasted about rigging elections in 1981.” Marzouki was referring to an interview with his successor, who appeared on Al Jazeera in 2011 and admitted that elections were rigged during his time as interior minister.  Asked whether he will run again in his country’s presidential election, scheduled for December, Marzouki chose not to give a decisive answer. “I will await to see whether the electoral process will be given all the chances to succeed,” he said."

Benjamin Netanyahu, the right-wing premier, is fighting a campaign ahead of April 9 elections, having long portrayed himself as ""Mr Security"" to Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blocked millions in Qatari aid to blockaded Gaza in response to renewed hostilities, risking increased tensions with the Palestinian territory's Hamas government during Israel's election campaign. Weeks of relative calm in the Palestinian enclave ended on Tuesday when Israeli soldiers were fired on along the fence with Gaza in two separate incidents. One soldier was lightly injured when a bullet hit his helmet. In response Israeli tanks struck two Hamas positions in Gaza, killing one Hamas member, while overnight Israeli fighter jets struck what the army said was a Hamas military camp in northern Gaza. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008 and fears of a fourth round remain. However, violence has abated since November as a result of an informal truce between the parties. Israel admits blocking transfer Under that agreement Israel has permitted Gulf state Qatar, a Palestinian ally, to bring in aid to Gaza, including $15 million a month to pay salaries of Gaza's civil servants and provide aid to impoverished residents. The January payment had been expected to enter Gaza on Wednesday or Thursday, but Netanyahu has decided to block it after the flare up, an Israeli official confirmed. This is the first time that Israel has admitted to obstructing the transfer, which was already delayed by two weeks. The payment would be the third of six planned tranches, totalling $90 million, in connection with the truce. Tel Aviv's permission is required since the cash must be delivered via Israel. So far Hamas has stuck to indirect warnings against Israel but said on Wednesday it held Israel fully responsible for any escalation. At the funeral of the Hamas member on Wednesday, mourners called for revenge as the body was accompanied by members of Hamas' military wing.  Conditions in Gaza desperate Israel maintains a crippling blockade of Gaza, the cramped territory wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean. Israel says it is necessary to isolate Hamas, but critics say it amounts to collective punishment of the enclave's two million residents. The Qatari payments are controversial in Israel, where they have sparked opposition from right-wing activists and politicians. In November Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned after accusing Netanyahu of being soft on Hamas following a flare-up. The right-wing premier is now fighting a campaign ahead of April 9 elections, having long portrayed himself as ""Mr Security"" to Israelis. Widely shared images of suitcases of cash being sent into Gaza through Israel could prove awkward for Netanyahu, running for a fifth term despite corruption allegations. Right to return protests Gaza came close to a new conflict a number of times in 2018, with Hamas-backed demonstrations along the buffer zone throughout the year. The weekly protests have been calling for Palestinian refugees in Gaza to be able to return to their former lands and what is now Israel. At least 244 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since March, mostly during clashes near the fence but also by tank fire and air strikes. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed. An Israeli NGO last week said Israel killed 290 Palestinians in 2018, most of them unarmed and posed no threat.  Killings related to Israel elections? Hamas said in a statement it ""never accepts shedding the blood of the Palestinian people to fuel the Israeli elections advertising."" United Nations envoy Nickolay Mladenov warned on Tuesday that the living conditions in Gaza remained desperate and the risk of new conflict was high.

In a statement, the ministry said the protesters – whose names were not given – were wounded by live ammunition. Gaza's National Authority for Breaking the Siege has urged Palestinians to take part in the rallies, holding Friday's demonstration under the banner, ""Unity is the key to victory.""

Right to return demonstrations Demonstrators demand the right of thousands of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and villages in historical Palestine, from which they were driven in 1948 to make way for the new state of Israel. They also demand an end to Israel's 12-year blockade of the Gaza enclave, which has damaged the coastal enclave's economy and deprived its roughly two million inhabitants of many basic commodities. Since the rallies began in March of last year, more than 250 Palestinians have been killed – and thousands more wounded – by Israeli troops deployed near the fence.  Israeli troops deployed near the buffer zone have responded to the demonstrations with deadly force, frequently using teargas, rubber-coated steel bullets and live ammunition against unarmed protesters."
TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/israel-and-hamas-agree-on-one-thing-mahmoud-abbas-12714244,Israel and Hamas agree on one thing: Mahmoud Abbas,An Israeli minister's comments seeking to exile Abbas and blaming him for unrest in Gaza is an indication that not only is Hamas fed up with Mahmoud Abbas - but Israeli leadership is fast losing any trust it had in him.,6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:18:05.960069,Israel War,TRT World,Middle East,"An Israeli minister's comments seeking to exile Abbas and blaming him for unrest in Gaza is an indication that not only is Hamas fed up with Mahmoud Abbas - but Israeli leadership is fast losing any trust it had in him.  Ask any Palestinian about Yasser Arafat and you would struggle to find anyone who would not refer to him as one of the key symbols of the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality. Whatever disagreements Palestinian factions had with him, he still commanded loyalty. It is unlikely that the sorry division between Fatah and Hamas would have happened under his leadership, or if had it happened it would have been allowed to fester for so long. The division has now entered its twelfth year. The same cannot be said about current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. To his credit, he oversaw the only elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006, which Hamas won and promptly asked its leader, Ismail Haniah to form government. Israel and the international community rejected the result of the free and fair elections and this marked the beginning of the end of Palestinian unity.  Palestinians met Abbas’ comments with despair about his renunciation of his right to return to his city of birth, Safad or his characterisation of the security cooperation with Israel, detested by them, as ‘sacred’. Las year his popularity deteriorated further as he carried out various steps to consolidate power while blaming other Palestinian factions for rejecting his call for meetings of the Palestinian National Council (PNC) and the Palestinian Central Council (PCC) in Ramallah. Abbas repopulated the PNC last year and transferred its powers to the PCC, neither of which has a true representation of Palestinians either in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) or abroad. Abbas also imposed sanctions on Gaza, which mainly affect ordinary Palestinians, to force Hamas to accept his conditions for reconciliation. Worried about Hamas bypassing the PA to agree quiet with Israel and its refusal to allow Fatah to celebrate its 54th anniversary tipped him over the edge. He accused those involved, of treachery. Abbas ordered PA inspectors manning the Rafah crossing to leave, forcing its closure. His latest move to consolidate power in his hands and to deal a fatal blow to Palestinian democracy was to dissolve the Palestinian Legislative Council PLC) which has been dormant for years. In claims and counter claims of who was legitimate the (PLC) in Gaza, made up of mainly Hamas members, recently declared Abbas’s presidency illegitimate as he had outstayed his four year term by over eight years. Repeated attempts by Arab states to bring Fatah and Hamas back from the brink have failed and it is ordinary Palestinians in Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank that have paid for this failure. A unified Palestinian leadership would have extended the Great Return March from Gaza to the West Bank and Jerusalem. This would have reinstated the Palestinian cause to its rightful place as a major issue for the international community to finally resolve. Instead, a resolution to the conflict appears to be off the international community’s radar while Palestinians continue to suffer. In the West Bank, the Israeli army enters Palestinian cities including Abbas’s seat of power, Ramallah, as and when it wishes. In Gaza, peaceful protesters continue to be shot, killed and maimed at the fence with Israel simply for protesting the 12-year long siege and demanding their return to their homes inside Israel 70 years after the Nakba. As US President Trump’s team continues to plot to end Palestinian aspirations for a just resolution to the conflict, Israel continues to expand its illegal settlements, to Judaize Jerusalem and Hebron and to repeatedly break into Palestinian towns and villages to abduct, demolish and oppress. It also continues to seek greater normalisation with Arab states, which seem to have fallen into the trap set up by the Trump Administration that their route to salvation from their perceived threat from Iran goes through Tel Aviv. It might be surprising to observe that what appears to be a very favorable situation for Israel just is not enough. It still seeks to see the Palestinians submit to its will and abandon any claims to freedom and return. Its southern front is not quiet enough and the sporadic attacks on Israelis in the West Bank are unacceptable while settler violence against the Palestinians is tolerated. The refusal by President Abbas to return to negotiations with Israel, his boycott of the US Administration following its decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and his inability to bring Gaza under control has led an Israeli minister to call for his exile. Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, is particularly unhappy with Abbas’s sanctions on Gaza, which he believes are contributing to the lack of quiet at the Gaza fence. The result has been minor and major incidents of rocket fire from Gaza, which has seen Israeli residents near the fence head for the bunkers. In a surprise move, Israel has allowed the transfer of Qatari funds to Gaza to pay workers’ salaries, something Abbas objects to, to help secure calm. Erdan says the PA leader is “one of the main instigators of violence on the southern border” through his campaign to pressure Hamas and has contributed nothing to the diplomatic process. He claims that Abbas “is the one to move inspectors out of the Rafah Crossing, he is the one sanctioning Hamas in order to pressure Hamas — pressure that is bleeding over to us.” He suggested that Israel should consider “should go as far as to consider one of the next times Abu Mazen leaves not to allow him to come back, because today he makes no contribution to the diplomatic process. He’s only doing damage with his attitude toward Hamas”. Thus Erdan is effectively calling for Abbas to be exiled. If Abbas then decides to avoid this by not venturing outside Palestine, then he would effectively be confined to his home and office in Ramallah. Israel could deny him permission to even move out of Ramallah to Bethlehem, Hebron or Nablus. While not as dramatic as Israel’s siege on his predecessor Arafat, which confined him to the Muqataa, he would effectively serve out his days feeling the full force of the occupation. Some might then see him as a hero. While Hamas and Israel appear to agree that Abbas is a problem, it is unlikely that they agree about how to deal with him. Hamas claims to want elections to unseat him democratically, while it appears Erdan wants his exile. Erdan and Israel again fail to learn from history. An act like this is likely to raise Abbas’s popularity, not as much as Arafat in his last days but enough to possibly bring about unity between the different Palestinian factions, which Israel does not want to see. Israel cannot expect to achieve quiet or peace through exiling or attacking Palestinian leaders."

A ‘secret’ meeting was held between the director of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt recently, according to a leak initially reported by the Middle East Eye. The meeting discussed a plan between Israel and Arab nations to normalise ties with Syrian regime leader Bashar al Assad, and restore Syria’s status in the Arab League in a bid to reduce Turkey and Iran’s regional influence.  Dr Ali Bakeer a political analyst and researcher spoke to TRT World on the motives behind the meeting. “It’s very likely that officials from Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt met with the Mossad chief. Relations between Riyadh, Abu-Dhabi, in particular, from one end and Israel on the other, have been warming up considerably over the last few years mainly through efforts by UAE Crown Prince Mohammed Mohammed bin Zayed and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman,” he says. In attendance were several senior intelligence officials from the four countries, including Mossad Director Yossi Cohen.  “I don’t see how Tel Aviv will benefit from pushing Ankara towards Tehran, when their priority is countering Iran,” he says. But Dr Bakeer doesn’t believe that countering Turkey ranks high on Israel’s priorities. “For MBZ, MBS, and Sisi, Turkey is the real problem given its position as a leading regional power with a Sunni majority, and its ability to inspire people throughout the Middle East to seek change. The very same change that these countries have actively challenged and opposed since the onset of the Arab revolts of 2011.” This is by no means the first meeting between Cohen and Arab state officials. In early October last year, former Saudi foreign minister Adel al Jubeir joined voices with the Mossad director at a New York meeting, calling for the overthrow of Iran. That meeting was also attended by Yusuf al Otaiba, the UAE Ambassador to the United States, who called the Iranian threat “existential."" Other notable attendees of that meeting, included US National Security Advisor John Bolton, and former CIA director turned Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo. Ambassador Otaiba himself reported running into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a ‘chance encounter’, where they also happened to discuss Iran, according to the Associated Press. It would seem that Saudi Arabia is spearheading the rapprochement with Israel, following a diplomatic leak in mid-September that claimed Saudi Arabia had purchased the Israeli Iron Dome defense system to defend itself against Houthi rebel missile attacks.  Saudi Arabia also reportedly purchased more than $250 million-worth of spy equipment from Israel, according to an exclusive report from Al-Khaleej Online.  Not an isolated incident Recent events, however, point to a broader trend of normalising ties with Israel, largely kept under wraps out of fear of public backlash from within the Arab world.  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, appeared in a controversial 60 Minutes interview aired by CBS that he initially tried to prevent from airing. In the interview, Sisi confirmed that Egypt’s military is working closely with Israel in the Sinai Peninsula. In a transcript of the interview, Sisi confirmed that cooperation with Israel was at its “closest” and “deepest."" Egypt is not the only Arab state to take steps toward normalising ties with Israel. In late October, Netanyahu met with the Sultan of Oman Qaboos bin Said al Said during an official visit, coinciding with the visit of Miri Regev, the Israeli Minister of Culture, to the UAE.  Regev has been accused of racism on multiple counts and is a hardliner proponent of assassination.   The Israeli minister has often been the subject of controversy, posting a video featuring genocidal chants such as: ""May your village be burned,” and calling migrants ""cancer."" Bahrain publicly backed Israel's in a tweet by its top diplomat in May 2018. The Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself has previously stated in an interview that he believes Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land, marking a radical departure from a policy of non-recognition set down by his predecessors.  Secret decisions, cloaks and daggers A number of resolutions were passed by officials at the secret meeting. Among them, was the agreement that instead of Iran, Turkey represented a threat as a major military rival in the region; going on to develop plans to counter Turkey’s influence in the region.  The Mossad director informed the gathering that while Iran could be militarily contained, Turkey had a much greater capability.  “Iranian power is fragile. The real threat comes from Turkey,"" he said. The secret gathering went on to coordinate talks between the Taliban and US officials, held a week later in Abu Dhabi. Another outcome was an agreement on the need to “control the Sunni card” in Iraq and to reduce Turkey’s influence in the Alliance of the National Axis, which forms the largest bloc of Sunni Iraqi parliamentary deputies. Shortly after, Mohammed al Halbousi was pressured by Saudi Arabia’s former ambassador to Iraq, during the latter’s trip to Riyadh on December 17, to reduce Turkey’s influence in the alliance or withdraw from it altogether. Halbousi went on to block Saba al Tai’s nomination for Minister of Education in Iraq.  Another member of the Alliance however, was nominated. The covert meeting also discussed restoring diplomatic relations with the Syrian regime. In the meeting, they conceded that Assad’s reliance on Iranian militias during the Syrian civil war meant he was not likely to abandon his Iranian allies. So they took a different angle. “They did not expect Bashar to break relations with Iran, but they wanted Bashar to use the Iranians rather than be used by them,” one Gulf official briefed on the discussions told Middle East Eye. “The message was: ‘Return back to how your father treated the Iranians, at least as an equal at the table, rather than subservient to Iranian interests.' Following the secret intelligence meeting, Sudanese President Omar al Bashir visited Damascus on December 16, making it the first official visit to Syria by an Arab leader since 2011. Ali al Shamsi, Deputy Head of Emirati intelligence, also visited Damascus. On December 27, the UAE announced that its embassy would be reopened in Syria after eight years. On the same day, Bahrain announced it would restore its diplomatic mission in Damascus as well. Only a few days earlier, Assad’s Special Security Adviser, Ali Mamlouk, visited Cairo, setting the stage for a possible normalisation of relations.  Sources speaking to the Middle East Eye, assert that Egypt’s primary concern is to ensure the Syrian regime establishes Turkey, Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood as its primary enemies.  This would be in exchange for Syria re-joining the Arab League, and Arab support for Syria in countering the Turkish military presence in North Syria, where Turkey is engaging the YPG, which is the Syrian wing of the PKK terror organisation. Finally, the heads of intelligence agreed to support militant groups against Turkey’s operation to expel the YPG from Northern Syria. This came alongside an agreement to enhance cooperation with the Kurdistan Regional Government, and stand in the way of any reconciliation between the regional stakeholders and Turkey.  “I think the plans to counter Turkey will create more division in the region, more instability and ultimately will end up creating a strong bond between ‘primitive’ Arab regimes and chaos in the region. This will utterly give Iran more space to manoeuver and prevail,” says Dr Bakeer. He adds, “If the initial plan for Israel and the Arab regimes is to counter Turkey, it will ironically be counterproductive, and this brings into questions the logic of countering Iran, given that it will create more incentives for Ankara and Tehran to work together. The 2017 Gulf crisis initiated by UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt is a clear example.” While the covert meeting marks a definite radical change in Arab-Israeli relations, it also reveals a deep and vested Saudi Arabian interest in countering Turkey by any means, even if it means redrawing its alliances, though perhaps to the detriment of the region as a whole. "

For a country that proclaims to deeply value individual freedoms - how has it reached this point? NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2017/03/29: The US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ms. Nikki Haley participated this morning at the United Nations General Assembly event of the world Jewish community against the BDS movement, which stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Companies and the State of Israel. (Photo by Luiz Roberto Lima/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) The disproportionate influence the state of Israel has over the United States’ political system is well known and documented in great detail by any number of academic enquiries, and none better than the details uncovered by prolific international relations scholars John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt in their groundbreaking treatise The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy. While the authors describe in meticulous detail the extent to which a loose coalition of pro-Israel organisations and wealthy donors have actively and successfully steered US foreign policy in a staunchly pro-Israel direction, they failed to forecast the depth and breadth of Israel’s near total stranglehold of political and civil life in the US today. What we are witnessing today is the total capitulation by both political parties and the entire US federal government to the state of Israel, which has all but ensured Israel’s national interests are now placed well ahead of those of the United States – at least in the decisions made by US lawmakers. Consider that the US Senate’s first bill of 2019, which was put forward in the midst of a federal government shutdown, was a bipartisan defence of the Israeli government from US taxpaying citizens who support the boycott Israel movement, otherwise known as Boycott, Divestment,  and Sanctions (BDS). Significantly, the bill, known as S.1, is the top legislative priority for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), better known as the tip of the Israel Lobby’s spear, and as noted by The Intercept, the bill is neither designed to protect US workers, nor deal with any of the country’s pressing problems, or even reopen the government. Its sole purpose is to protect Israel from Americans exercising their constitutionally protected right to boycott, which in itself is a speech act. For the past half-dozen or so years, a slew of Republican Party sponsored anti-BDS Israel bills have made their way into state legislatures all across the country, with 26 states now basically criminalising any act that calls for the support of boycotting Israel owned companies or institutions. Even newspapers in the US are now being pressured into pledging not to support a boycott of Israel. Last week, for example, the publisher of the Arkansas Times described to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) how “letters from the state of Arkansas began drifting across my desk, demanding that our weekly newspaper, the Arkansas Times, either sign a pledge not to boycott Israel or forfeit all state advertising,” adding, “The letters were the result of an obscure, cookie-cutter law passed in 2017 by our Republican-controlled legislature.” This anti-boycott Israel push makes a mockery of self-proclaimed American values, given the trajectory and advancement of civil rights in the country are indeed shaped by political boycotts, with the boycott of “whites only” restaurants and businesses in the Southern states instigating what would eventually become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which put an end to racial segregation. “Since when do American citizens have to pledge to act in the interest of a foreign power to do business with their own government?” asks Alan Leveritt, publisher of the Arkansas Times. US subservience to Israel’s self-interests extends beyond the political realm. Last month, for instance, CNN, the global cable news giant, fired one of its long-time and popular contributors, Marc Lamont Hill, fewer than 24 hours after he delivered a speech at the United Nations that merely expressed support for Palestinian civil rights and statehood. The decision to fire Hill was based on the false premise, one propagated by the Israel Lobby, that equates criticism of Israel’s illegal occupation and discriminatory laws with anti-Semitism. Now consider the fact that CNN is also the same network that hires Alan Dershowitz, the Jewish American lawyer who describes Palestinians as “cockroaches” and “Nazis.” In firing Hill, US media outlets have essentially conceded to pro-Israel pressure and have now adopted the false belief that criticism of Israel equates to hatred of the Jewish people, which ultimately is a disastrous blow to honest political debate and free speech in the country that has long championed both. All in all, Israel’s inordinate chokehold of American civic life is fast moving from the sublime to the absurd, a realisation exemplified by the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. It recently rescinded its honouring of iconic and legendary civil rights campaigner Angela Davis on Sunday, citing her support for the BDS movement, a decision she based on Israel’s stubborn refusal to comply with international law and human rights. In the event the point needs further belabouring, we now are at a point where US civil rights organisations are dishonouring civil rights campaigners for exercising their support for Palestinian civil rights. So, in the past month alone, we have witnessed the US Congress prioritise defending Israel from criticism above the interests of American workers and economy; the blackmailing of American newspapers at the behest of pro-Israel advocates; the firing of a journalist for supporting equal rights for Palestinians; and the stripping of an award from an iconic American civil rights activist. It might be time for the US to update the last line of its national anthem to “Land of the free, home of the brave, and Israel’s client-state.”"

Benjamin Netanyahu has outdone himself this time. While attending the inauguration of Brazil’s newly elected populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, he told Brazil’s Globo TV that Arab countries see Israel as an “indispensable ally” in fighting Iran and Daesh.Presumably, he was referring to the rapport Israel has found with the GCC in their common enemy.In Brazil, he described the shared understanding as the reason behind “a revolution in relations with the Arab world.”The statement is ironic at best. Israel labels itself as the “indispensable ally,” joining a merry bond united in common cause against the external existential threat that is Iran, while ignoring the major elephant in the room: Israel occupies more Arab land, causes more conflict, death and destruction than Iran ever has.  Let’s take a step back. This is by no means an attempt to whitewash Iranian foreign policy, its bloodied proxies, countless interventions, interference in the affairs of countries along sectarian lines, not to mention its propping up of the brutal dictator Assad in Syria.  It is, however, a reality check.Netanyahu, how can you be both ally and the single largest occupier of the Middle East at the same time? The Golan Heights? Sinai? Palestine?Israel is the world’s largest source of state-sponsored terrorism, and is the proud owner of the worst record of flagrant violations of international law, blatant disregard for international conventions, and continued abuse of human rights.Even if you take the humanitarian angle out of the equation, we must ask the question, it’s no minor insult that Netanyahu can claim to be an “indispensable ally,” in light of all that has happened between the nations and all that continues to happen.Netanyahu seems to have polished his capacity to connect bald-faced lies, and his ability to shamelessly present them. It’s a far cry from the days where the Israeli president brought an instructional poster board to the United Nations General Assembly to educate world leaders, in the most condescending fashion, on what a nuclear bomb is and where Iran is. He was only missing his laser pointer.It’s only to be expected that Israel would make the most of regional tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia and its allies, but the gall to make such statements while standing knee-deep in the blood of civilians, massacres and the heart of conflict in the region speaks much of the impunity that Israel has come to enjoy.To that end, it also speaks much of the state of the Middle East and its Arab leaders.To add insult to injury, Netanyahu has made absolutely clear that he has no intention of returning to the negotiating table to find a peaceful settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.The statement came shortly after the US’s decision to withdraw from Syria last week, leaving Israel scrambling since it had counted on continued US support as a cover to their own increasing air strikes on Iranian positions in Syria.In a Machiavellian swerve, Netanyahu explained away the lack of any progress on peace talks with the Palestinians.“Half of them are already under the gun of Iran and of radical Islam,” he added. Such a sweeping statement left unmentioned his unwillingness to negotiate an end to even the illegal encroachment on Palestinian land by Israeli, radical, armed settlers.No amount of assassination, lobbying, condescending lies, or back-channel deals can change the reality of the matter: Israel is an apartheid regime taking comfort in the blanket protection of the United States should worse come to worse: A protection realised through the lobbying and subversion of the American democratic process, no small amount of wealth, and a great deal of intimidation.  Don’t take my word for it. John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, esteemed professors of the Universities of Chicago and Harvard respectively, wrote a 60-page report of their findings on the extent of the Israeli lobby’s penetration of the US foreign policy establishment. Netanyahu should give up the blatant whitewashing of Israeli crimes. No one buys it."

President Donald Trump meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, March 5, 2018, in Washington. The United States has formally withdrawn from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the culmination of three decades of bipartisan foreign policy designed to please Israel at the expense of international peacemaking and American interests. The US leaving UNESCO also renders even more absurd and impossible President Donald Trump’s promises of finding a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. How can the US be an honest broker when it harms not only Palestinians, but also itself? Israel, for its part, has also left the organisation. Although the decision was made on Trump’s watch, leaving UNESCO wasn’t his idea. President Barack Obama pulled the US away from UNESCO after its recognition of the Palestinian Authority in 2011. A US law passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress in 1990 prohibited US funding for any organisation that recognised Palestine. Unlike Trump moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, a pointless and provocative act, or his withdrawal of humanitarian funds from the Palestinian Authority, the UNESCO departure represents deeper problems in how the US relates to Israel. The United States was a main supporter of the creation of UNESCO, back during the founding of the United Nations after World War II. The international body’s purpose was to prevent another world war. UNESCO’s role is one that lets countries manage each other’s ‘soft power’ as a collective. Soft power is a hard-to-quantify quality, but one can imagine it as everything a country does to enhance its image and reputation. Protecting ancient historical sites and providing information about other countries became UNESCO’s role. Although this sounds easy, the historical narratives of national leadership and the historical facts often diverge. Getting countries to agree on a single interpretation of history is perhaps harder than getting them to agree on the limitations of nuclear weapons. One can count nuclear weapons, but there’s no way to quantify national standing or pride. For Israel, one of their problems with UNESCO was classifying the ancient city of Hebron as a Palestinian heritage site. The city is where Jews and Muslims can worship near the tombs of Abraham and his family. It is also under military occupation, where soldiers stand guard around Israeli settlements. Designating the city as Palestinian did not force the soldiers or settlers to leave, but appeared to undermine the entire Zionist project of restoring a Jewish homeland on Biblical territory. There’s no price tag you can put on such matters, and rather than trying to help both sides find a solution, the US has just given up. Everybody wants to look good, and few countries want to take an honest, much less apologetic or regretful, look at their past. In the United States, for instance, the history of the Boston metropolitan area includes both the events of the American Revolution in the 18th Century and the rise of the anti-slavery Abolitionist movement in the 19th Century. Boston's history also involves the genocide of Native Americans and the hanging of people accused of witchcraft in the 17th Century. In the 20th Century, the city became a world-renowned educational hub, but also saw violence over the integration of black and white students in the same public schools. And that’s just one American city. Israeli nationalism relies on interpretations of history that occurred both in the 20th century and thousands of years ago, and the supposed ‘anti-Israel’ bias of UNESCO shows how important these events are to Israel’s national story. No one wants to live in a country responsible for genocide. How can one have pride in a place like that? It would be easier to imagine it didn’t happen, rather than come to terms with it. In the US, for instance, some high school textbooks still treat the Civil War as a matter of ‘states’ rights’ and not slavery. Monuments to Confederate generals, who fought to keep people in chains, still stand in American cities and have provoked protests. In Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, one of those protests turned deadly when a white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of people, killing demonstrator Heather Heyer. How will the world remember that day, August 12, 2017, in 200 years? Let’s just imagine that UNESCO will be around in 200 years. What kind of plaque will Charlottesville get?"

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be in Warsaw along with leaders from the Arab world. There is little that will make Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as happy as a photo-op with Arab leaders whom he's scheduled to meet on Wednesday in Warsaw, Poland.  Netanyahu and a number of officials from Middle Eastern countries are gathering for a two-day summit organised by the United States.  Initially, the meeting was supposed to be part of the Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA), which has been dubbed the Arab NATO – a regional security alliance comprising members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), plus Egypt and Jordan.  The main purpose of the meeting that includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates was to build an alliance against their common enemy, Iran.  For Netanyahu, who faces an election in April amid a corruption probe, this could easily turn out to be an opportunity to show-off his leadership acumen, especially when the status of Palestine is not part of the equation.  But the refusal of a major power such as Russia to attend the meeting has forced the US to change its tone. The gathering is no longer being mooted as a platform to form an anti-Iran alliance. Instead, it’s aim has been refocused on the stability of the Middle East.  Palestinian officials have denounced the US-led initiative, calling it a “conspiracy aimed at eliminating the Palestinian cause.”  Most European countries are sending low-ranking officials. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has announced she won’t be attending the meeting either.  Only British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is scheduled to participate, but he says that’s because he wants to talk about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthis.  Poland’s position remains ambiguous. While becoming a willing host of the conference, it has publicly stated that it stands with the EU in backing the nuclear deal with Iran.  The landmark agreement signed in 2015 was aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme but offering the country relief from sanctions. Poland’s ruling nationalist government is trying to woo Washington to build a permanent US military base.   Kushner’s show?  Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s advisor and son-in-law, is expected to share some parts of his “deal of the century,” which seeks to bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  He will not reveal the entire proposal until after April 9 elections in Israel.  Israel is still not recognised by the Arab countries except for Egypt and Jordan. But a few developments last year indicated that the Jewish state might finally be reaching a rapprochement with its Arab neighbours. In October 2018, Netanyahu traveled to Oman to meet the Sultan and was given a state reception.  That preceded a visit by Israel's Sports and Culture Minister Miri Regev to Abu Dhabi, where she cried while the Israeli national anthem played at a sporting event.  What remains unclear is how much of a benefit Arab states stand to draw from their close cooperation with Israel, which shares Saudi Arabia’s unease over Iran’s military expansion in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  Some experts say the US wants to use the Warsaw meeting to mobilize a predominantly Arab force, made up largely of soldiers from Egypt and Jordan, to act as peacekeepers in Syria.  On its part, Iranian officials say the conference is just another attempt to pressure the Islamic republic, which has survived harsh US sanctions.  “Reminder to host/participants of anti-Iran conference: those who attended last U.S. anti-Iran show are either dead, disgraced, or marginalized. And Iran is stronger than ever,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in a tweet last month.  Zarif also criticised Poland for hosting the conference, recalling how Iran had given refuge to thousands of Polish people during the Second World War.  In the midst of this geopolitical shift, what’s not being talked about is the Arab League’s 2002 peace initiative, which offered Israel diplomatic relations only in exchange for its withdrawal from the Palestinian lands."

Police said there was evidence to charge Netanyahu with bribery, fraud, breach of trust and unlawful acceptance.

In this January 29, 2011 file photo, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi speaks on his cellphone at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz has filed a lawsuit against Israeli surveillance company NSO, claiming its sophisticated spyware targeted him and helped lead to the killing of his friend, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. According to the lawsuit, Abdulaziz, a sharp online critic of the Saudi royals and a resident of Canada, where he has received asylum, said he was friends with Khashoggi and worked with him on a project meant to rein in pro-monarchy Saudi trolls. Abdulaziz received and clicked on a link sent to his phone in June 2018 that he says exposed his mobile communications to Saudi authorities. The lawsuit says Abdulaziz faced increased harassment by Saudi authorities after he clicked on the link, including the detention of family members in Saudi Arabia. The suit, filed in a Tel Aviv court on Sunday, follows others previously filed against the company. But because of its links to the international outrage over the killing of Khashoggi, it is likely to shine a larger spotlight on the company and the Israeli government, which licenses the export of the surveillance technology. The company called the lawsuit ""completely unfounded,"" saying it shows ""no evidence that the company's technology was used."" Israel's Defence Ministry declined to comment on its export policies. TRT World speaks with Joe Macaron, a fellow at the Arab Center Washington, DC. 'Spying contributed to decision to assassinate' Abdulaziz plans to argue that his cooperation with Khashoggi was ""a crucial factor"" in the decision to have the US-based columnist for The Washington Post killed and that there was a direct link between the surveillance carried out on Abdulaziz and the slaying. ""The spying that was directed against [Abdulaziz] and the disclosure of the content of the conversations and messages between him and Khashoggi through the system contributed significantly to the decision to assassinate Mr. Khashoggi by the assassins at the consulate,"" the lawsuit states. It cites news reports and other sources claiming that NSO Group sold Saudi Arabia the technology in 2017 for $55 million. The lawsuit says Abdulaziz was notified that his phone was compromised by internet watchdog Citizen Lab, which says it has used an internet survey technique to identify suspected spyware infections linked to the Israeli company. Abdulaziz is demanding 600,000 shekels — about $160,000 — in damages from the company, as well as an order preventing it from selling its technology, known as ""Pegasus,"" to Saudi Arabia. Smartphone-hacking  The NSO Group's smartphone-hacking technology has emerged as a favourite for authorities seeking to crush dissent across the Middle East and Latin America. The Israeli firm's software is part of a larger family of malware that allows spies to take remote control of phones from anywhere in the world — turning the devices in targets' pockets into powerful surveillance tools. In a written statement, NSO Group disputed some details in the lawsuit and said it ""appears to be based on a collection of press clippings that have been generated for the sole purpose of creating news headlines and do not reflect the reality of NSO's work."" The company said its products ""are licensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime in the modern age."" It said it takes ""an extremely scrupulous"" approach to the sale of its products, which also undergo vetting and licensing by Israel's Defence Ministry. In an earlier statement it said, ""We do not tolerate misuse of our products. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract,"" it said. Khashoggi killing A 15-member team sent from Riyadh strangled and dismembered Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two months ago. His remains have yet to be found. Turkey says the orders for the killing came from the highest levels of the Saudi government, but not King Salman. Meanwhile, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he is willing to take the Khashoggi homicide case to the UN. The Saudi agents blamed for the killing include some members of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's security entourage. After weeks of denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's death, Saudi authorities acknowledged that he was killed in the consulate, saying a team of agents sent to retrieve him had exceeded their authority. Lawsuits against NSO NSO has been under the spotlight for months as dissidents, journalists and other opposition figures have claimed the company's technology has been used by repressive governments to spy on them. These include Mexican and Qatari journalists who have already filed lawsuits against the company and an Amnesty International employee who was allegedly targeted by the software. The new suit comes days after Amnesty said it was considering legal steps to have NSO Group's export license revoked. Israel: 'Rogue' cyber company NSO Group must have licence revoked over surveillance spywarehttps://t.co/kXBSliE28j It said it had made an urgent request to Israel's Defence Ministry to revoke the company's export license following the targeting of one of its employees. It said the request was denied. ""We thoroughly reject this inadequate response. The mountain of evidence and reports on NSO Group and the sale of its spyware to human rights-violating regimes is substantial proof that NSO has gone rogue,"" said Molly Malekar, programs director of Amnesty International Israel. By continuing to approve NSO's export license, she added, Israel is practically admitting to knowingly cooperating with a company whose ""software is used to commit human rights abuses."""

This December 2, 2009 photo shows Lev Leviev at a district court in Tel Aviv, Israel. Israeli police are demanding his return from Russia to be questioned of charges including smuggling, money laundering and tax offenses. A shadowy Israeli billionaire who made his fortune in the insular world of diamonds has suddenly found his empire in jeopardy after close associates were busted in a massive smuggling ring and an employee mysteriously plummeted to her death from his high-rise Tel Aviv office building. Lev Leviev, known in Israel as the ""king of diamonds,"" has enjoyed close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has a reputation for generous philanthropy to Jewish causes. But now, Israeli police are demanding that he return from Moscow for questioning on allegations of smuggling, money laundering and tax offences. It's a stunning downturn for one of Israel's most well-known tycoons. Born in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, the 62-year-old Leviev immigrated to Israel as a youth in 1971 and began working as an apprentice in a polishing plant in Israel's then-booming diamond industry.  His meteoric rise saw him later establishing a plant of his own, and striking deals in Angola and Russia that briefly undercut the DeBeers diamond giant. He later branched out to real estate, construction and chemicals, with his Africa-Israel holding and investment company becoming a powerful player in the Israeli market and establishing Leviev as a precursor to a wave of Jewish oligarchs from the former Soviet Union who have become power brokers in Israel. Though his net worth is estimated at more than $1 billion, Leviev suffered heavy losses in recent years because of his massive investment in Russia, where he is known to enjoy strong government support.  Leviev, who moved to London a decade ago and recently relocated to Moscow, denies any allegations of impropriety and is currently negotiating terms of his return with Israeli police.  But insiders say that even if he hasn't been formally charged with a crime, his mere association with the suspects accused of smuggling some $80 million worth of diamonds hidden in briefcases over several years could be devastating to his brand. ""I can't believe he would put himself in such a situation. He is still a strong oligarch, and this is not his style. A smuggling of this scale could topple businesses far larger than his,"" said Alex Kogan, a journalist who has covered the oligarchs in Israel for the local Russian-language press. ""Even if he is not involved, this whole affair will harm him greatly."" Leviev's son and brother were arrested in early November, along with four others, and are currently out on bail in what has been dubbed the ""Black Diamond"" affair. The saga took a more tragic turn on November 11, when Mazal Hadadi, a bookkeeper for Leviev's diamond firm LLD, fell to her death from a small, elevated bathroom window on the 10th floor of his office building next to Israel's Diamond Exchange. The death was initially reported as a suicide, the supposed result of a breakdown following tough police questioning about the smuggling affair. The family acknowledges Hadadi was rattled by the investigation but insists the mother of three would never take her own life and was on her way to meet her husband after work when a mysterious call to her cell phone made her abruptly return to the office. Israel's reeling diamond industry has been trying to distance itself from the affair. With tens of thousands of employees in the 1970s, Israel was once the world's largest diamond trading center but fell on hard times in recent years because of the proliferation of synthetic diamonds and outsourcing of polishing plants to countries like India, where wages are far lower. Dubai has also cut away at Israel's status as the regional gateway for trading because of tax benefits for companies. But Israel is still a leader in the polishing of large diamonds and a hub for e-commerce and technological developments. Though officially still a member of the Israel Diamond Exchange, Leviev hasn't been seen in Israeli diamond circles in years as his business interests focused elsewhere and his brother took over the leadership at LLD. An official in the industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said the affair has put a strain on other Israeli diamond dealers. The Israeli market is now considered to be a highly regulated industry that has cleaned up its act after decades of shady dealings and association with ""blood diamonds"" mined in conflict zones that financed human rights violations. In 2003, Israel joined the Kimberley Process by which members meet annually to discuss strengthening controls over conflict diamonds. Leviev's alleged motivations are also a mystery, since diamonds entering Israel only need to be declared and inspected rather immediately taxed. For now, there are far more questions than answers. The Israeli media has been filled with trickles of information along with interviews with the bereaved bookkeeper's family, criticism of police conduct and speculation over whether Leviev will return and be arrested. In a statement, Leviev's Israel office denied all allegations against its employees. ""Mr. Leviev and all of the companies under his control operate in accordance with accepted norms, adhering to the law,"" it said. ""We hope that this matter will be clarified quickly and the suspicions will be proven baseless."" It's the kind of attention Leviev has long tried to avoid, preferring to limit his media coverage to his philanthropy for the Chabad movement, a Hasidic sect that performs outreach to Jews around the world, rather than his diamond dealing. ""It's a closed world where people like to keep their secrets,"" said Kogan, the journalist. ""He doesn't like publicity and doesn't like to stick out."""

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 27: Thousands of Palestinian-Americans and supporters assembled December 27, 2009 to protest the one year anniversary of the Israeli Army's attack on Gaza in New York City. In a peaceful demonstration but closely watched by the New York Police Department, the protesters marched across 42nd Street to the Israeli Consulate where another demonstration took place. (Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, elected in November to represent a district outside Detroit, Michigan, is taking a bold step against the ignorance and indifference in Washington DC to Palestinian suffering.  Israel goes to great lengths to conceal the Palestinians' plight from US lawmakers, but Tlaib is trying to change that.  Her proposal, first reported by The Intercept, also shows a growing divide inside the Democratic party over what US support for Israel means. It also comes amid a generational and partisan shift in attitudes about Israel among the American public, and ironically is due to Israel’s “success” in defeating its neighbours on the battlefield and crushing Palestinian national aspirations.  The oldest fossils in Washington came into politics as Israel was pushing back against Egyptian and Syrian tanks, fighting Soviet-supported Palestinian guerillas and presenting a “democratic,” English-fluent alternative to Yasser Arafat making a speech to the UN while strapped with a pistol.  That world no longer exists, but American lawmakers still act like it does. As a means of enforcing Apartheid, Israel has systematically killed or imprisoned anybody, even children, who could stand to be another Arafat. Maybe that seemed like a good idea at the time, but they forgot that their biggest military supporter, the United States, is also home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian-Americans, a diaspora community that has family ties to occupied territory and now has one of its own inside Congress.   Importantly, Tlaib says her delegation will not be meeting with members of the Palestinian Authority at all. It’s not clear yet which members will join her, although newly elected Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, Congress’s other first Muslim woman, has expressed support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which advocates the economic and cultural isolation of Israel in protest of its human rights. Tlaib herself has also come out and said she personally supports BDS. Tlaib’s proposed trip for fellow incoming lawmakers runs counter to the tradition of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) taking new members on a luxury junket of Israel, without an excursion to the West Bank.  “I want us to see that segregation and how that has really harmed us being able to achieve real peace in that region,” Tlaib told The Intercept.  “I don’t think AIPAC provides a real, fair lens into this issue. It’s one-sided. … [They] have these lavish trips to Israel, but they don’t show the side that I know is real, which is what’s happening to my grandmother and what’s happening to my family there.” But advocates for Palestinians shouldn’t break out the sweets just yet.  Tlaib and others in Congress have an enormous challenge ahead of them in turning the tide in Washington away from slavish support for Israel’s occupation and denunciations of dissent against the Democratic party line as anti-semitism.  No one wants to get crushed between billions of dollars of military contracts and false accusations of racism. The conflict itself also seems to be just part of the furniture in the grand salon of American foreign policymaking, a bloodstained couch too heavy to move.  Israel’s occupation thrives on silence, from Israeli soldiers who have participated in the occupation’s cruelties, but also silence in the public sphere.  The firing last week of Marc Lamont Hill, a CNN commentator, shows the penalties that Israeli hasbara culture enforces through intimidation and misinformation. Hasbara is the Israeli word for propaganda, or “explanation,” and Hill ran straight into it when he decried Israeli human rights abuses and called for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea” at a United Nations conference.  Absurdly, his detractors said he was calling for the destruction of Israel.  Promoting the idea that Israel is on the brink of destruction, from flimsy Gaza rockets or the spectre of non-existent Iranian nuclear weapons, is key to how hasbara enforces a culture of silence about Israeli human rights abuses, even attempting to criminalise support for BDS, something top Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer has himself supported.  But bipartisan support for Israel is running up against the realities of an alliance between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Aside from corruption scandals, the two men have a lot in common, like the belief that might is right. Netanyahu’s embrace of Trump, a friend of white nationalists, and Trump’s embrace of Netanyahu, also a friend of white nationalists, has given American liberals reason to pause and reconsider what kind of country Israel really is.  How could it be a fortress for liberal democracy in the Middle East if its leadership, and people, have such a reverence for a president so hostile to American democracy? Maybe, just maybe, Israel’s occupation of Palestinians and white supremacy are somehow intimately linked.  What’s slowly dawning on American liberals is that maybe Israel isn’t really a democracy. How can a country claim to be a democracy when millions of people under its control, basically half the population, have no say in that control? Palestinians and Palestinian-Americans have known Israel isn’t a democracy for a long time, but have had to wait decades before getting a seat in Congress. What a new relationship Tlaib and other lawmakers will conceive between Washington and the inhabitants of the Holy Land remains to be seen. Nothing, as yet, is written. "

Palestinian youths run from tear gas canisters while carrying Palestinian flags by the barbed wire fence along the border with Israel east of Gaza City, during a border demonstration on December 7, 2018. For the 37th consecutive Friday, Palestinians started to converge on the Gaza-Israel border to take part in ongoing mass demonstrations against Israel’s decades-long occupation. In a statement, Gaza’s National Authority for Breaking the Siege renewed its call for Palestinians to take part in the ongoing rallies, naming the 37th Friday as ""Great Intifada of Stones,"" as it coincided with the 31st anniversary of the Palestinian intifada (uprising). The first intifada, or the ""Intifada of Stones”, began on December 8, 1987, from the Jabalya refugee camp in the northern Gaza before moving to all Palestinian towns and camps. “Our people insist on taking part in the return marches for the 37th Friday, which coincides with the 31st anniversary of the Intifada in which all our people revolted against the Zionist (Israeli) occupation,"" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement. ""The struggle of our people is just and legitimate and will continue until its goals of freedom and return are achieved,"" he added. Protesters in Gaza demand the right to return to their homes and villages in historical Palestine, from which they were driven in 1948 to make way for the new state of Israel. They also demand an end to Israel’s 12-year blockade of the Gaza, which has gutted the coastal enclave’s economy and deprived its roughly two million inhabitants of many basic commodities. Since the rallies began on March 30, more than 210 Palestinians have been killed — and thousands more injured — by Israeli troops deployed near the border zone. "

December 13, 2018 On December 13, Sarah, a teacher from Palestine’s Ramallah, in occupied West Bank, woke up as she does on any ordinary day. But she realised everything had changed shortly after rumours started spreading in her school that Israeli soldiers were about to ‘take over’ Ramallah.  Hours earlier than the usual end of the school day at 2.30 pm, parents rushed to pick up their children, fearing they would not be able to reach their homes. All the shops in the city were shut early.  Meanwhile, three Palestinians were killed in the West Bank during Israeli raids. Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said one of them was wanted for a drive-by shooting in the east of Ramallah in October, near the illegal Israeli settlement of Ofra, which resulted in the death of two Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to legalise thousands of settlements in the West Bank, illegal under international law, two days before the recent Israeli raid.  “It seemed like there is an invasion,” Sarah tells TRT World.  People had already been taking to the streets in other parts of the city when a fourth Palestinian was killed by the Israeli forces in a separate operation.  The Israeli army reportedly fired tear gas, sound bombs and bullets to disperse Palestinian protesters in Ramallah. On the same day, Israel announced it would block the exits of Ramallah as it declared the city a closed military zone.  Christina, a freelance writer based in Ramallah tells TRT World that the aftermath of the lockdown by Israel is isolation and panic.  “Ramallah is a centre of life for a lot of people and its the main area where a lot of the ministries and governmental departments are, a lot of people move back and forth for paperwork etc,” Christina says.  “The exits and entrances to the city were closed leaving hundreds of people stuck. The community opened its houses to those stuck to stay over until they can go home.” Praising ‘Palestinian resistance,’ Hamas called on Friday for a ‘day of rage’, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the violence.  Hamas is has been controlling the besieged Gaza Strip since 2006, while its long-time rival, the Palestinian Unity Government, led by Fatah, rules the occupied West Bank.  Sarah, worried that she might be stuck if Israeli soldiers come to her area, and with no cars left to take her back home, was able to rush to her family after leaving school. The governor’s office said it would arrange accommodation for anyone who needed a place to stay due to the Israeli blockade. “We’re all scared,” she says. “My sister visited us yesterday. Even though she lives close, she stayed over because she didn’t feel it was safe driving,” she says.  The IDF arrested 56 people across West Bank and Jerusalem on Thursday morning. At least 40 more were arrested in overnight raids.  Protests continued in the West Bank on Friday. Palestinian Authority security forces also reportedly attacked and arrested protesters in West Bank’s Hebron. Tensions have been high in West Bank since last year, when US President Donald Trump unilaterally recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announced the decision to move the US embassy there. Israeli forces often conduct raids in the West Bank to capture Palestinians. For Christina, the recent seal off of Ramallah by Israel was not only ‘a reaction’ to the shooting attack, it has a wider meaning: collective punishment."

If only Israel was as creative in seeking peace with the Palestinians as it is in finding different ways to punish them. A policy of dehumanisation that aims to present Palestinians to the world as sub-human, violent and not worthy of achieving the inalienable rights that they crave and which international law provides them with. The very same people that lived in harmony as Jews, Christians and Muslims prior the creation of Israel are now extremist, anti-Semites who raise their children to hate and to kill or maim Jews. They have no right to the homeland they are from, they are not worthy of an independent state or a share of Jerusalem, which Israel claims to be its eternal, undivided, capital. The security of Israel and Israelis is sacrosanct, while even areas where security was assigned to the Palestinians under the Oslo Accords can be breached by Israeli troops at any time, to abduct wanted Palestinians—adults or children—and to demolish homes and businesses. Palestinians are accused of raising their children to hate, their leadership of inciting them to attack Jews, whether civilian or heavily armed soldiers, simply because they hate rather than because they are trying to free themselves of the longest occupation in modern times. Jews can build anywhere in historic Palestine, while Palestinians have to seek permits to build from the occupier whether in Israel proper or the occupied West Bank. Israel can ignore international law and agreements it is a signatory of, including the Oslo Accords, but Palestinians must always act lawfully and implement everything signed. Ask any state, other than Israel, what they believe to be the solution to the conflict and you will hear near unanimity that it is a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as a shared capital for the two states. They will tell you unequivocally that the settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem are illegal under international law. There is of course an exception to this consensus, which has emerged since the Trump administration took office. As Trump put it in his first press conference with Netanyahu, he is with whatever solution the two parties like. The same proponents of the two-state solution will tell you that the settlements and the continued building in existing ones and the establishment of new ones is ‘closing the window’ on the two state solution. However, announcements of further expansion are met with nothing more than an ‘expression of concern’ or ‘regret’ and possibly ‘condemnation’. Save for a momentary freeze to settlement construction for ten months in 2009, Israel has continued to build unabated. The Trump administration has been silent on this issue, which Israel has clearly taken to be a green light to continue building. Had Trump made his controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel conditional on a commitment to freezing and dismantling settlements, we may have seen a change in Israeli policy. In fact, the recognition was a freebie for which Israel was not asked, nor required, to concede anything. Settlements as collective punishment The Palestinians have taken what they believe to be the crime of settlement building to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and are awaiting the court’s decision on whether it will open an investigation. Israel’s response to the Palestinians taking cases to the Hague has been to punish them by withholding taxes it collects and is obligated to hand over to them. If that in itself is not a bizarre act, it has decided that it will deduct the funds the Palestinian Authority allocates to support the families of those either imprisoned or killed by Israel for allegedly committing violent acts against Israeli civilians or military personnel. While the ICC prevaricates, Israel has now moved to use settlement building as punishment and as a deterrent to others who may think of attacking Israelis. It also routinely demolishes the homes of those allegedly committing violent attacks against Israelis in an act of collective punishment, which only serves to incite Palestinians. Surely, Israelis cannot expect Palestinians that have had their loved ones killed or imprisoned, that have been thrown onto the street and whose contribution from the PA to help them make ends meet stopped, to love it and admire it. The creative ‘Palestinian punishment’ ministry in Israel has now developed a new policy to punish Palestinians committing violence against Israelis, that of sanctioning more illegal settlement building. Israel’s Attorney General Avichai Mendelbit recently approved the so called ‘market amendment,’ which is expected to lead to the legalisation of 2000 illegal settler units in the West Bank. The ‘market amendment’ is based on an order related to property Israel claims to be ‘government property’ in the West Bank, stipulating that ""a transaction made in good faith between the custodian of the government property in the territories and another person, regarding a property the custodian believed at the time of the deal to be government property"" is valid, even if in fact the land did not belong to the state. In other words, Israel can claim any land even privately owned as its own and it can create or approve illegal homes on it. This really brings a completely new, sinister meaning to ‘good faith’. The same ‘principle’ of ‘good faith’ was the basis for a recent ruling by the Jerusalem District Court, which stipulated that the outpost of Mitzpeh Kramim must be legalised, despite being built on privately owned Palestinian land. The Attorney General’s amendment will now open the floodgates to the legalisation of thousands of illegal homes being legalised despite them having been judged illegal by Israel itself. The reality is that Israel does not need an amendment or a ruling by a district court to act illegally. It is in breach of hundreds of UN General Assembly resolutions and tens of UN Security Council resolutions, including the most recent on settlements 2334, passed in December 2016. The latest act of punishment of Palestinians will neither deter nor end violent acts against Israelis as any student of recent history will learn. This will not stop the ‘Palestinian punishment’ ministry in Israel thinking of other punishments. But who will stop Israel committing further atrocities?"

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara Netanyahu visiting the Choral Synagogue in Vilnius, on August 26, 2018. Israeli police on Sunday said they had found enough evidence for bribery and fraud charges to be brought against Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife in a third corruption case against the Israeli prime minister. Authorities allege Netanyahu awarded regulatory favours to Israel's leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel, in return for more positive coverage of him and his wife on a news website, Walla, owned by the company.  Netanyahu rejected all allegations against him and his wife during a speech to his Likud party in Tel Aviv to celebrate the start of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. “It’s clear for everybody to see the transparent, petty timing of the publication of the pre-determined recommendations, the deliberate leaks, the tainted process and the false allegations about me and my wife,” Netanyahu said.  “[The investigation] has been a match-fix. The recommendations aren’t surprising, and the timing isn’t surprising.” His credit with the public has gone down since.  Over 70 percent of those surveyed by The Israel Democracy Institute perceived the government to be corrupt.  At least 19 percent of the respondents thought Israel's leadership was ""quite corrupt"" while 28 percent marked ""very corrupt."" Only six percent respondents thought the leadership was ""not at all corrupt."" Here are five things you should know about the Netanyahu corruption case: What is Netanyahu accused of? There are four corruption allegations against him, known as cases 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000. He is accused of bribery, fraud, breach of trust and misuse of state funds. Case 1000: Netanyahu is suspected of accepting gifts of cigars, champagne and jewellery from Israeli producer Arnon Milchan and business tycoon James Packer. These gifts were estimated to be valued at hundreds of thousands of shekels. His wife Sara Netanyahu has been accused of asking Milchan for jewellery worth $2,700. In case 2000, Israeli police claim to have tapes showing negotiations between Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, Yedioth publisher, to make daily coverage more positive towards the prime minister in exchange for restoring Yedioth's ranking among the country's media. Although Netanyahu gave testimony for case 3000, he was not implicated in this one. But his close aides are suspects, accused of bribery and fraud in the procurement process of submarines worth $2 billion. After a lengthy investigation into case 4000 involving Netanyahu's relationship with Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Israel' s telecom giant Bezeq, police want to bring charges. Police said they found sufficient evidence that confidants of Netanyahu promoted regulatory changes worth  $280 million to Bezeq. In exchange, they believe Netanyahu used his connections with Elovitch to receive positive press coverage on Bezeq's popular news site Walla. The Bezeq case is the most serious of which Netanyahu has been accused. Two of his top confidants have turned state witnesses and are believed to have provided police with incriminating evidence. Netanyahu held the government's communications portfolio until last year and oversaw regulation in the field. Former journalists at the Walla news site have attested to being pressured to refrain from negative reporting of Netanyahu. Who else is accused? Sara Netanyahu has also allegedly misused state funds for her personal spending. In one case known as the “Meals ordering affair,” the prosecutor said $100,000 worth of food was ordered to her family residence from luxury restaurants in Israel from 2009 to 2013. She also illegally hired a private chef for $10,000, despite the availability of a state chef. She was charged in June with fraud and breach of trust and of aggravated fraudulent receipt of goods. If convicted, Sara Netanyahu could face up to five years in prison. How have Israeli officeholders fared in past investigations? Former prime minister Ehud Olmert resigned after a police investigation recommended indicting him for corruption in September 2008. He was found guilty in 2014 of accepting bribes from real estate developers when he was Jerusalem’s mayor, before his 2006-09 term as prime minister. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison but only served 16 months. Former president Moshe Katsav was on trial for raping a woman and sexually harassing two of his staff members. He resigned in 2007 as a part of plea bargain.  Katsav was found guilty of rape and sexual harassment and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011. He served five years of his sentence. There have been other cases where former officeholders were indicted and sentenced over bribery, smuggling and other charges. What does Israeli law say about removing a sitting prime minister?  In order to remove Netanyahu from office, three stages need to be completed according to Israeli law. The police should investigate to see if there is enough evidence to formulate charges. The attorney general, in this case Netanyahu's close associate, should review the police investigation and then charge the prime minister. Three judges in the Jerusalem District Court have to hear the case against the prime minister. Finally, the prime minister will only be forced to quit office if the High Court of Justice rules he or she was convicted in a crime involving moral turpitude. What happens next? Netanyahu's fate now lies in the hands of his attorney general Avichai Mandelblit, who will decide in the coming months whether the prime minister should stand trial on a host of corruption allegations that could play a central role in next year's election campaign. The police recommendations do not have any immediate impact on Netanyahu. They go to his hand-picked attorney general, Mandelblit, who will review the material and make the final decision on whether to press charges. That decision will have a great impact on Netanyahu's future. Israeli law is unclear about whether an indicted prime minister would have to step down. But at the minimum, a trial would put great pressure on Netanyahu, who has been in office for nearly a decade, to step aside. Israel must hold its next election by November 2019. Mandelblit's office has not said when he will issue his decision. Most analysts expect him to take several months to review the material. Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said Netanyahu will likely try to push forward elections before Mandelblit decides whether to indict. Netanyahu holds a solid lead in all opinion polls, and a victory would make it more difficult for Mandelblit to indict and potentially force out a newly re-elected leader. ""He'll send a message to the attorney general that everyone knew about these three police reports and they still voted for him and want him in power,"" Hazan said. That would force the attorney general ""to seriously reconsider his decision,"" he said."

Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the ""attack tunnels"" detected were not yet operational.  He declined to say how many were detected or how they would be cut off. All operations would take place within Israeli territory, Conricus said, though they were likely to boost tensions with Hezbollah, the Shia militant group with which Israel fought a devastating war in 2006.

Israel’s operation targeting alleged Hezbollah ‘terror’ tunnels in Israeli territory has once again raised the seemingly perennial issue of a third Lebanon war. The Israeli operation, the complexities of Syria, increased potential of destabilising financial measures targeting Hezbollah, amongst a host other domestic and international political issues, have arguably raised the political temperature to its highest sustained levels the since the 2006 war. The prospect of war seems to have become an almost metaphysical truism continually hanging over the scenic landscape in this small corner of the eastern Mediterranean. While flare-ups have occurred sporadically since the end of the so-called ‘July War’ in 2006—most notably in Syria where Israel has on several occasions targeted Hezbollah and Iranian interest—since the passing of UN resolution 1701, which established the parameters of the cease-fire between the two sides, all parties have avoided any action that would push things over the brink. Several interrelated factors can explain this relative peace. Firstly, Israel is well aware that the costs, both material and human, that it would incur in any future conflict with Hezbollah would be much more significant than in 2006. Then, an Israeli bombing and subsequent ground campaign that followed on the heels of a Hezbollah cross-border raid in which three Israeli soldiers were killed, two captured and resulted in 34 days of fighting and the deaths of at least 39 Israeli civilians and 119 soldiers. Although media reports at the time indicated overall damages of $3 billion (USD), Israel’s infrastructure remained mostly untouched. Lebanon and its people, of course, paid a much higher price. In any new war, Israel would undoubtedly face strikes against its critical infrastructure including power plants and even Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. In the ten years since the July war, Hezbollah has reportedly acquired over 100,000 rockets and missiles with the ability to fire over 1,000 per day and with a range that can target every major city in Israel. Furthermore, multiple reports have emerged in the last few years of Hezbollah manufacturing its own weapons systems in Lebanon, including drones and guided missile systems. Foreign intelligence assessments have concluded that the Hezbollah’s arsenal includes Iranian-made Fateh-110 missiles, scud missiles and guided surface to air missiles. Furthermore, despite Israeli strikes against the Syrian regime and Iranian and Hezbollah-affiliated facilities in Syria, Hezbollah’s leader appeared in September on Lebanese television to announce that “no matter what you do to cut the route, the matter is over and the resistance possesses precision and non-precision rockets and weapons capabilities.” Another factor that will assist in maintaining the status quo is the domestic political scene in Lebanon itself. After the 2018 parliamentary elections strengthened the party’s hand, Hezbollah has become even more focused on consolidating their power at home, rather than focusing on their enemy in the south. This is evident from the recent election campaign in Lebanon, in which the Hezbollah-led electoral alliance campaigned under the slogan of ‘build’ and ‘protect’. Furthermore, although the party remains popular with its core supporters, there have been instances of opposition from within the Lebanese Shia community. The elections showed a growing dissatisfaction with Hezbollah’s politics, particularly its intervention in Syria, which has reportedly cost the lives of at least 2,000 of its fighters. In the current political climate, it is unlikely that Hezbollah would want to risk not only more casualties among its fighters but also the massive costs that would undoubtedly incur regarding the civilian casualties and the destruction of critical infrastructure in Lebanon. Following the end of the 2006 war, Hezbollah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah said that had he known that Israel would respond so heavily, he would not have ordered the capture of the Israeli soldiers. He would go on to claim that Israel had already planned to go to war later in the year, a claim not out of the realm of possibility. However, it was clear that Hezbollah miscalculated, something they are unlikely to repeat. The Syria Factor There are of course some factors that could disrupt this relative peace, not least of which is the ongoing conflict in Syria. Events over the last year seem to indicate the possibility that hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel could break out in Syria, leading to a potentially dangerous, direct, confrontation between Israel and Iran, something neither party wants, despite the rhetoric. The consolidation of the Iranian and Hezbollah positions in Syria and the recent declaration of Hezbollah’s intention to stay in Syria have only made this more likely. However, Russia’s promise to deliver its state-of-the-art S-300 air defence system to Syria following an Israeli air raid that led to the downing of a Russian reconnaissance plane has arguably shifted the balance of power between Israel and Hezbollah in Syria. The Russian move potentially inhibits Israel’s ability to strike Hezbollah facilities in Syria and, ipso-facto, its ability to stop the transfer of weapons to Lebanon. The increased anxiety this is likely to cause among Israeli decision-makers may amplify the voices within Israel calling for confrontation with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Saudi-Iran Factor Another wildcard is the ongoing regional struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MBS), the Saudis have made clear their intolerance of Iran’s (and therefore Hezbollah’s) regional meddling. In Lebanon’s case, as was demonstrated by the November 2017 Hariri debacle in which the Lebanese Prime Minister was, by many accounts, forced to resign at the behest of MBS, the Saudis are willing to sacrifice Lebanon in pursuit of their strategic objectives. The strategic alignment between Saudi Arabia and Israel vis-a-vis Iran and Hezbollah combined with the increasing brashness and unpredictability of Saudi actions in the region, may, in the end, prove dangerous to the Lebanese. While it is likely that the current relative peace between Israel and Lebanon will remain, miscalculations, such as those that happened in 2006, are a distinct possibility. The wild cards of Syria and the Saudi-Iran rivalry could also upset this fragile balance. And while today’s Israeli operation is unlikely to upset the balance, a misstep by either side could lead to war. The difference this time around is that the stakes, both locally and globally, are significantly higher.  "

The sun shines on Government Buildings in Dublin, Ireland on November 24, 2017. Ireland’s Senate, or upper house of parliament, on Wednesday approved a bill that criminalises the import and trade of goods and services originating in Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories. The draft bill passed the committee stage last week. While the Irish government opposes the bill, it will be enacted if it is approved by the lower house of parliament. If this occurs, Ireland will be the first EU country to impose such a ban on Israeli settlements. ""We will enact this vital bill with great support,"" Senator Frances Black wrote on social media. In a statement earlier, Black also emphasised that the bill is a minimum requirement for being an EU country that is committed to justice and human rights. The Israeli embassy in Dublin has condemned the bill, calling it ""populist” and “dangerous"". The Irish Senate voted 25-20 in July to advance the bill, which would criminalise trade with Israeli settlements, including those built in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. According to the draft law, anyone importing or attempting to import from the settlements would be committing a crime punishable by up to five years in prison or a 250,000 euro fine."

Israel's tunnel vision is about Netanyahu as much as it is about Hezbollah  Just how much of what we read about Israel discovering new Hezbollah tunnels on its northern border with Lebanon is real? Some of it? None of it? Recently, international media in London and Washington went big on the “tensions” between Lebanon and Israel over these tunnels. Given that nearly everything we read from the Israeli government about the West Bank and Gaza is a magnum of lies, how seriously should we take this latest news item? If Israel can’t even tell the truth about how its soldiers killed scores of unarmed protestors earlier this year (citing that they were a threat to the border itself), then why should anyone take their latest news event seriously? Even from a distance, there are many aspects of the Hezbollah tunnels story that just don’t add up. It might be a good starting point to ask why Israel is raising this issue now. The tunnels themselves have been there for years and many are known to the IDF, who surely looked into them in 2014 or perhaps even earlier. For years the tunnels have been known about, and for years they haven’t spooked the Israelis. Until now. What happened in Israel in the last few days which coincided with this amazing discovery? The corruption case against Netanyahu’s is building, and it can't be ignored. The tunnels story, which actually isn’t a story at all, is designed entirely to distract both international and local media away from the real crisis that the Israeli leader has: opposition parties now, for the first time, calling for his resignation. Israel has never felt more vulnerable than now, as, its own campaign to hit Iran and Hezbollah in Syria flounders and increasingly, we are hearing and reading reports about Iranian cargo jets landing in the dead of night in Beirut to offload GPS technology to turn rockets into high precision missiles. The UN draft resolution put forward by the US, condemning Palestinian armed groups for repeatedly firing rockets into Israel and for inciting violence, was submitted a few days before the operation. The Israeli operation acts as a convenient public relations component to lend credence to the Israeli narrative. Israel panicking What we are seeing with the tunnels story is a sort of panic from Israel, all designed to crank up and win an entirely different war with Hezbollah: the media one conducted across the salient op-ed pages of the world’s most prestigious newspapers. From a distance, pundits might argue that Israel has won this war. Its own generals cause a stir in Israel and give their opinion on a nuance of the “inevitable” war with Hezbollah; this is then written up as fact, in Israeli media, which is then reported on and analyzed by an army of academics in the US who compound the ‘facts’ and before you know it, American journalists are quoting the academics writing about the same ‘fact’ – which all along was fake news. But then there’s the cherry on the top for Netanyahu, which is that Israeli media and public opinion is affected by US media giants and what their top people are writing, so the fake news goes full circle and comes home in a new suit. And this is what the latest Hezbollah story is all about. There are no new tunnels which Israel has just discovered and is threatened over which are creating a “new tension”. The entire news fable is just a yarn, and one designed to score Netanyahu political points back home – but one which in reality is showing Israel to be more of a loser in the power struggle between itself and Iran in the region, rather than a victor. It’s a game of double and triple bluff. And Hezbollah, to its credit, usually doesn’t rise to the bait. Both sides know that the tunnels themselves are a military parenthesis to a bigger story.  Israel does not fear Hezbollah will use them to ‘invade’ as the group doesn’t have ambitions in this direction. They are a deterrent and a scare tactic which works very well. They may well be used in the event of an Israeli attack, to fill Israeli villages with Hezbollah fighters – which is a genuine fear for the IDF – but the bigger worry for Israel is not the tunnels that it claims it has discovered, but more the ones that it hasn’t found yet. For people in the UK and the US who are not familiar with the details and practices of both sides, the video clip provided by the IDF of a tunnel, complete with a Hezbollah fighter approaching an IDF soldier would be quite convincing.  But let’s be serious. Anyone who knows Hezbollah and understands that it is a disciplined, military organisation, knows it would not put its own people in tunnels so close to the Israeli border, without at least a weapon – and not in uniform.  Hezbollah would not risk losing one of its own fighters which it has invested so much time and money in, simply to be captured by the IDF, while hanging out in the tunnel.  Also, what sort of a tactic is it from the Israeli side to apparently identify and block or destroy the tunnels and let the other side know this? The idea that the IDF has discovered tunnels dug by Hezbollah and now need to blow them up, doesn’t add up. We’re being sold a kipper here and the fact that no journalist – local or international – are allowed a peep for themselves leads me to suspect that the entire story is fabricated. In reality, this new item is woefully designed to calm the Israeli public after the reports of missiles being delivered to Beirut were more or less accompanied by a tranche of carefully timed intel leaked by the Lebanese group about cities in Israel it can target – complete with satellite photographs – which has vexed Netanyahu, and rightly so.  Sorry, no war. But the truth is that there is no ‘new tension on the border’ which is being reported now. And there is no imminent war between the two sides as both sides need one another for their own political objectives. Indeed, one of the greatest myths perpetuated by the Western media is that Israeli hawks dream of destroying Hezbollah, when in reality this could not be further from the truth. The hawks need Hezbollah.  Israel could be at peace with itself regionally, but the political capital gained from the so-called war with Hezbollah is too great, and far outweighs, for example, the pretext of Iran being Saudi Arabia’s enemy.  Both scenarios present the incumbents with a cause, which deflects from better governance. If there was no threat from Hezbollah, then the media and political elite of Israel – let alone armchair experts in Ohio or Oxford - may look more closely at Netanyahu’s leadership and stumble upon more incriminating evidence. The same goes for Hezbollah, Israel provides a great distraction.  The next time you see a video clip on youtube of Israeli military carrying out operations on its border and the mention of Hezbollah tunnels, you may as well click on the clip of the back-flipping performing kitten which knocks grandma’s wig off. There will, at least, be more integrity in this video montage.  The next news item about Hezbollah tunnels you are likely to see is a report about a Hollywood movie made about them. That’s where they belong, after all."

The draft resolution makes no mention of a two-state solution, settlements, the siege on Gaza, Jerusalem or any of the other core issues of the conflict, but “condemns Hamas for repeatedly firing rockets into Israel and for inciting violence” in a macabre twist that holds the Palestinian side exclusively responsible for incitement and deterioration of the overall security situation. The US added irony to insult in a clause calling for the reunification of the West Bank and Gaza under the Palestinian Authority (PA), while completely ignoring the fact that Israel is a central factor behind the physical division and publicly halting any efforts at reconciliation. But why now? A common mistake made by analysts when observing American behaviour on issues related to Israel is to view it through the lens of American interests or internal politics. As renowned scholars like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt highlighted a decade ago in their well-known book ‘The Israel Lobby’, American behaviour is directly governed by Israel’s demands when it comes to the Middle East, with the US Administration having very little say in it. Take a look at President Obama, well known for being a strong advocate of the two-state solution. Nonetheless, he did little to nothing to stop Israel from burying the possibility of any solution over expanding illegal settlements, their apartheid regime, or the annexation of Jerusalem and other occupied territories. It was only until the end of his term (when he no longer needed the pro-Israel lobby for another electoral victory, or to pass any bill at the Congress) that he simply abstained from blocking the UNSC resolution, which added nothing but condemnation of Israel’s policy of encroaching settlements. This, of course, does not entirely rule out the fact that internal issues do shape US policy on Israel. Trump desperately needs anything to divert attention from his scandals or from issues like MBS’s involvement in murdering Khashoggi. But let us suppose for a moment that Trump didn’t need the diversions. America would still be acquiescent to Israel’s demands and narrative. Critical attention should be given to why Israel decided to bring the matter to the UNGA, a place it frequently disrespects and disparages with deep disdain. As Israel’s ambassador to the UN Danny Dannon said, “it’s a win-win”. For Israel, simply diverting attention from its grotesque violations of international law, its actions aimed at politically paralysing Palestinians and maintaining dominance over Palestinians is a winning strategy. Israel cannot defend its actions, but why justify when you can just put the Other under the spotlight? Jerusalem and Golan are annexed, as the rest of the West Bank will be eventually. The legal system is well designed to ensure Palestinians have no say in any democratic elections. The dilemma of refugees would be ‘solved’ by shutting down the UNRWA, and so far, the one ‘unsolved’ matter is the Palestinian armed groups, and their spirit of resistance, that Israel was unable to eliminate. Well, perhaps the intentions are corrupt, but should Hamas not be condemned anyways? Sweden’s foreign minister mentioned some reservations regarding the US draft earlier but emphasised that Hamas should be condemned anyway. Let’s take a deeper look at the situation. The principle of self-determination, emphasised in international laws, agreements and customary law, is a basic pillar of international law, and the means for achieving this principle have been protected and enshrined by international law as well. The UNGA conferred a special status on national liberation movements and several UNGA Resolutions, including UNGA Res 37/43 of 1982, 43/106 of 1988 and many others, that “Reaffirm[ed] the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence, territorial integrity, national unity and liberation from colonial and foreign domination and foreign occupation by all available means, including armed struggle.” The same resolutions affirmed that they apply to the case of Palestine. I believe Palestinians should seek means of peaceful resistance at all levels. However, limiting their right to seek self-determination would have disastrous results on the very practice of self-determination worldwide. It would justify a state’s occupation of another state or territory while providing those states with the perfect pretexts they need to justify suppressing opposition and labelling it as terror. What of the PLO? Against all expectations, the Fatah-led PLO has adopted a strong position against the draft resolution and called upon all states’ missions to the UN to reject it, viewing it as an assault against the Palestinian people. It is known to all how serious the Fatah-Hamas rift is, and it isn’t just about who leads. To a large extent, it is about how to lead, and what approach to secure Palestinians’ rights. For Fatah, the peace process was the first choice until its chances for success were recently strangled, and then it was unilateral action at international courts and fora. For Hamas, peace efforts which are not backed by military force are useless. They often cite that Oslo was a result of the serious security pressure from the First Intifada. However, Fatah was very firm in its position, certainly not to please its rival Hamas, but because it is well aware that this draft resolution is part of a broader context with lethal undertones: isolating the Palestinians and reaching a ‘solution’ that certainly doesn’t require their consent. So, where does this take us? Though the UNGA resolutions are not legally binding, it is not the law that Israel seeks, but the symbolic value of UNGA resolutions. Any UNGA resolution will have to be voted on by the entirety of the United Nation’s member states. This implies political value that could be employed in many ways. What Israel seeks from this resolution goes well beyond diversion of attention from its crimes. It seeks to dehumanise Palestinians and disenfranchise their cause so that it may carry out a larger operation in Gaza, either uprooting Hamas and any armed group there or simply pushing Gaza 50 years back through further destruction of its infrastructure and what little is left of the city. What we saw in previous wars is possibly nothing compared to what Israel could do if left unchecked, while empowered by a US blank cheque underwritten by even a single resolution. It doesn’t take a lot of wisdom to realise that the United States and the international community should be going after the strong who can solve the conflict, instead of the weak that have hardly any say on the issue in first place. Palestinians, whether they go back to the artificial rituals of a peace process or opt for armed struggle are not the ones who can decide on the outcome. All they can do is try to halt or hinder their opponent’s plans. It is only the United States and Israel that can end this misery, and reach a just solution for all."

Despite rising anti-semitism in parts of Europe, Israel seems to have no qualms in cosying up to the far-right. FILE PHOTO: Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini poses with two members of the Central Security Operations Service (NOCS), a SWAT team of the Polizia di Stato, during a visit to celebrate their anniversary in Rome, Italy October 10, 2018. REUTERS/Remo Casilli -/File Photo Israel—whether its liberal or centrist proponents like it or not—has become an ally for the European and Western far-right.  Later this month, Matteo Salvini, the far-right leader of the fascist Lega party and current interior minister of Italy, will travel to Israel to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Before winning power, Salvini had previously travelled to Israel, where he gushed, ‘Israel embodies the perfect balance of different realities while ensuring law and order. It surely is a role model for security and anti-terrorism policies’.   So what does Salvini mean by ‘security’ and ‘anti-terrorism’?  Well, during his reign as interior minister, Salvini has been a trailblazer in Europe for brutal anti-immigration policies, as well as attacking Italy’s existent ethnic and religious minorities. He recently crafted a law that essentially eliminates humanitarian grounds for granting protection to refugees and asylum seekers.   Though Lega can’t yet end its commitments to take in refugees and asylum seekers entirely, the law paves the way for such an outcome. If there are those in doubt that this is Lega’s ultimate aim, on the day the bill was passed, Lega lawmakers who had just voted it into power gathered outside to unfurl a banner reading, ‘The Salvini decree is law; the good times (for migrants) is over.’   Salvini has compounded and exacerbated the EU policy of halting all rescue operations in the Mediterranean by prohibiting NGOs from operating rescue services for migrants and docking at Italian ports. There ought to be no doubt that Salvini and Lega have a concrete plan to change the political landscape in Italy. Salvini is slowly but surely testing the waters with his racist ideas and policies. Conjuring chilling memories of Italy’s fascist past, Salvini called for a register of Italy’s Roma population, while he has demanded the cleansing of all ‘non-Italian’ Roma and has increased demolitions of ‘illegal houses’ used by Roma. Mirroring Nazi racial laws, he has even called for ‘ethnic shops’ to be restricted. So how do neofascists like Salvini come to be the premier defenders and allies of the Jewish state?  It’s precisely because it is a Jewish state.  Israelis are of course perfectly entitled to self-determination, including the self-definition of their state. But the fact is that Israel has, over the past few decade–but with much greater urgency and radicalisation in recent years–become an ethnocracy defined as much by its Jewish character as its hostility to non-Jews. European fascists like Salvini see in Israel the perfect paradigm of directly racist states. And while all states are racial states (in that they embody, in some form, ethnic majoritarianism), Israel’s policies are often brazenly crafted by a form of ethnic chauvinism unseen since the colonial period.  It has long been documented how Israel’s occupation and illegal annexation of the West Bank have led to apartheid-esque conditions between Jews and Palestinians.  However, Israel proper has always awkwardly balanced the fundamental contradiction of upholding equal rights for Palestinian citizens of Israel and maintaining Israel as a Jewish state; that is, a state where there must be a permanent Jewish majority with an unassailable Jewish character.  Though Israel has managed to ensure equal rights for non-Jewish citizens, its recent Nation State bill, which doesn’t merely reaffirm the Zionist commitment to Israel as a state for Jews, but asserts that only Jews have the right to self-determination within Israel. This is Salvini’s self-declared ‘role model’.  This is the same idea that lies behind fascist slogans such as Italy for the Italians, Europe for the Europeans and, of course, America First.  European fascists fetishise Israel because it’s a state that openly embraces their racially divided views of the world – a world governed by the racist laws of ethnic majoritarianism. Its entire raison d’etre is to keep the Jews in their state, while, to Salvini, Italy ought to be a state only for Italians. Israel’s main appeal to European and Western fascists is precisely that it disregards and subverts the liberal democratic order that prevails in Europe. We’ve seen a host of European fascists draw closer to Israel as an ideological and geopolitical ally.  For decades, it has crafted an ethnocracy that reduces Palestinians to second-class citizens when it isn’t perpetrating acts of mass murder against them with no recourse to law or the liberal values that Salvini and his ilk believe are killing Europe.  The relations of Israeli domination and ethnic chauvinism that govern the annexed West Bank are precisely what European fascists envision for Europe and its relation to migrants, especially Muslims.   Israel puts itself forward as a defender of ‘Western civilisation’ and Islamophobia is perhaps the strongest sinew that connects Western fascism with Israel. Salvini has openly stated that Muslims and Islam are incompatible with Italy, but, despite his embrace of Israel, antisemitism is on the increase in Italy. This is also something we’ve witnessed with the rise of Trump in the US – an increase in antisemitic incidents - and this points to the reality that ought to simultaneously disturb yet unite us: racists, on a street-to-street level, do not discriminate. And this growing form of ethnic majoritarianism fits nicely into the increasing authoritarian world order. We’ve seen the genocidal attack by the Burmese regime on Rohingya Muslims, and we’ve witnessed the antisemitic mass murder of Jews at a synagogue in Pittsburgh by an antisemitic America Firster. We’ve seen the genocide of Sunni Muslims in Syria by a regime that openly spouts sectarian justifications for such murder while appealing to Israel-esque defences of defending Europe from the Islamic menace.   We cannot stand by and simply watch as these relations once again become a reality in the heart of Europe"

This peace will likely never materialise.,6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:18:05.960069,Israel War,TRT World,Middle East,"Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman managed to hack into the White House by recruiting an impossibly gullible official with promises of peace for Israel.  This peace will likely never materialise.  Jared Kushner was so out of his depth that the Saudis reportedly made a presentation to explain to each other how lacking he was, as though they couldn’t believe their luck. This kind of scam isn’t new, foreign governments are expert at pulling fast ones in Washington DC, but what makes this special is that the individual in question is the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose primary qualification for the job is that he’s married to Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter.  The Saudis have decades of Israeli propaganda to thank for how easy it was to manipulate him. Israel relies on maintaining the illusion among its American supporters that an end to the conflict would be easy, if only Palestinians would come to their senses, based on little more than the assertion that  “Israel wants peace.”  Despite all contradictory evidence, Israeli propaganda uses this slogan to try to absolve Israel of responsibility for the violence. Saudi Arabia was able to use Israeli propaganda to its advantage when making grand, empty promises to Kushner.  According to a New York Times
investigation published Saturday, the Crown Prince groomed Kushner for years before the gruesome murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in October. By that point, Kushner was reportedly offering MBS advice on how to run publicity interference after the killing.  More than building schools, hospitals or water treatment plants for Palestinians, or dismantling illegal Israeli settlements, staying one step ahead of the press, and orchestrating flattering coverage for Trump, was the nature of the Kushner-MBS alliance. The Times report also suggests that Kushner may have helped MBS in his bid to seize power in June 2017.  That Kushner and MBS are close is old news, but the Times revealed the absurd extent to which Saudi Arabia had the 37-year-old wrapped around its finger. Others in the White House were worried that Kushner was getting “played” by the Saud family’s ruthless strongman. Kushner’s ignorance, incompetence, laziness and cynicism were key ingredients, but it’s impossible to disentangle them from the alternative reality Israeli propaganda creates, and Kushner believes.  Tucked at the bottom of the story is an acknowledgement of the Palestinians’ suspicion of Saudi promises to broker some kind of peace deal. But the story also serves as a stinging indictment of the American Israel Lobby’s distorted view of the realities in the region, a distortion that makes them easy for Israelis, and now Saudis, to manipulate. First, a word about the term “Israel Lobby.” It’s not something that flies freely from the mouths of policymakers or journalists in Washington, because the first rule of the Israel Lobby is that you don’t talk about the Israel Lobby. Doing so can lead to charges of anti-semitism that can, and have, shattered the careers of those who mention its outsized influence on American foreign policy.  A collection of pro-Israel think-tanks who jump at the chance to excuse Israeli atrocities, the Lobby has the ear of both Republican and Democratic party lawmakers, whose goal is either appeasing it or at least staying out of its way. By conflating criticism of Israel with vile racism against Jewish people, the Lobby has been able to build a wall around an open and honest debate about US policy towards the troubled middle eastern country. But the culture of silence over the Israel Lobby may indeed fuel anti-semitic conspiracy theories. One American Jewish journalist, Phil Weiss, editor of Mondoweiss, a news site focused on Israel/Palestine, said it best in a piece about the late President George HW Bush running afoul of the Lobby over illegal settlement construction. Bush then lost to Bill Clinton, who was friendly to illegal settlements on Palestinian land. Weiss (once an editor of mine) put it this way:  ""Of course, discussing these issues in any depth would involve addressing the power of the Israel lobby in U.S. politics. The press doesn’t like to do that because any discussion of Zionist influence is thought to be anti-Semitic. But that failure only empowers the lobby– which loses when it is called out openly, as it lost in 91 to Bush– and because the influence is so obvious that the silence fuels anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, about the lobby controlling foreign policy and the press."" This silence also creates situations like Kushner’s cosy relationship with MBS. How can a grown man believe that Saudi Arabia had some kind of magic lamp it could rub for middle east peace?  But Kushner, who has funded illegal settlement building in Israel, is honestly the kind of American supporter that Israel loves: Stunted in their understanding of Israel/Palestine at the level of an uncurious high schooler. Although the Kushner family is close with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, somehow Netanyahu never sat the young man down for a frank discussion of how, and why, Israel/Palestine defies any easy resolution. What is easy for Israel, however, is keeping most Americans like Kushner in the dark about the occupation, and the reason is more linguistic than anything else. Kushner and most other American fans of Zionism don’t speak Hebrew or Arabic, so the raw data from the region remains permanently encrypted, coded from right to left, and encountered mostly in English.  The Information Age is changing this, as the proliferation of horrific images of Israeli repression reaches American eyes, recorded and distributed by Palestinians themselves. No language is necessary to understand that Palestinian teenager Ahed Tammimi slapping the face of an Israeli soldier was an act of resistance, not terrorism.  On the purely political front, Kushner’s ignorance is harder to understand. Even if you sincerely believed that Israel is the victim 100 percent of the time, its imprisoning of millions of Palestinians is necessary and right, you might come at any peace plan with some serious scepticism. Kushner had a little, the Times reports, but that melted away when the Saudis explained that Riyadh is a foe to terrorists just as Israel is.  What the Saudis capitalised on in Kushner was his ignorance and indifference regarding the extent of Palestinian suffering, just as the Israel Lobby does in Congress on a much larger scale.  Almost a hundred years of Apartheid and bloodshed doesn’t just vanish over the course of a news cycle. A peace plan for Israel/Palestine would need to address the poverty, trauma and daily indignities of occupation generations of Palestinians have endured just for the crime of being born Palestinian. It would also require the remaking of Israeli society. The problem is of literally Biblical proportions. Saudi Arabia throwing billions of petrodollars into the mix isn’t enough.  But the deepest, saddest reason for Kushner’s stupidity is the lie Israel has peddled for decades: Palestinians do not exist. They are merely Arabs, just like all the rest of them. Their culture and traditions are myths, invented as a reason to undermine the legitimacy of Israel.  The lie is summed up succinctly in the Zionist catchphrase about the British mandate of Palestine: “For a people without a land, a land without a people!”  The land did have people, Palestinians, but those people had yet to encounter the concept of nationalism in practice. When they did, it came to them in the form of Zionism.  Kushner’s understanding is that there are two kinds of Arab: rich, powerful Arabs, who are potential allies, and poor, powerless ones, who are potential terrorists. That appears to be the extent of his understanding of Arab culture. It’s a lie that has worked for Israel for decades. In exploiting Kushner’s breathtaking gullibility, Saudi Arabia decided it was their turn to make that lie work for them too. "

US President Donald Trump meets Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison during the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina November 30, 2018. Australia now recognises West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday, but a contentious embassy shift to the occupied city from Tel Aviv will not occur until a peace settlement is achieved. Morrison also committed to recognising a future state of Palestine with east Jerusalem as its capital when the city's status is determined in a peace deal. ""Australia now recognises West Jerusalem –– being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government –– is the capital of Israel,"" Morrison said in a speech in Sydney. ""And we look forward to moving our embassy to West Jerusalem when practical, in support of and after final status of determination,"" he said, adding that work on a new site for the embassy was under way.

The dispute Both Israel and the Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital. Critics say declaring Jerusalem the capital of either inflames tensions and prejudges the outcome of final status peace talks. Trump's decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv last May prompted tens of thousands of Palestinians to approach the heavily-protected Israeli border. At least 62 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire that day. Morrison is expected to stop short of actually shifting Australia's diplomatic corps to the Holy City, amid warnings from his own officials about the cost and security implications. But by recognising West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital could help the embattled Australian PM - who faces the prospect of an election drubbing next year - with Jewish and conservative Christian voters and win him friends in the White House. His supporters argue Israel has the right to choose its own capital and peace talks are dead in the water, so there is no peace to prejudge. But the move still risks heightening unrest, both in Australia's immediate neighbour Indonesia - the world's most populous Muslim nation - and further afield. The Palestinian government would press for Arab and Muslim states to ""withdraw their Ambassadors"" and take some ""meat and wheat"" style ""economic boycott measures"" if the move went ahead, Palestinian ambassador to Australia Izzat Abdulhadi told AFP. Jakarta protests  Indonesia's government, facing domestic pressure at home, reacted angrily earlier this year, when Morrison floated the idea of both recognising Jerusalem and moving the Australian embassy there. The issue has put the conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement on hold. In the meantime, Australia's foreign ministry has moved to prepare the ground. ""Demonstrations have been held in recent weeks around the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the Australian Consulate-General in Surabaya,"" it warned in a public notice Friday.

An Israeli soldier stands next to the vehicle of a 60-year-old Palestinian man, after he was shot dead by soldiers in what the army said was an attempted car ramming attack, near Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank (December 13, 2018). A top Israeli human rights expert warned on Monday that Israel will likely face criminal charges at the International Criminal Court in the Hague if it approves legislation to expel the families of Palestinian militants from their homes According to Jerusalem Post, Prof. Yuval Shany, chairman of the UN Human Rights Committee, told Army Radio that the legislation would likely be annulled by the Israeli Supreme Court but could lead to charges being brought against the country at the ICC. The head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service has also warned cabinet members against adopting a bill that would allow the forced relocation of Palestinians whose relatives were convicted of attacking Israelis, Haaretz newspaper reported Monday. According to Haaretz;  however, Shin Bet chief Nadav Argaman is opposed to the bill, saying the proposed legislation could “set the West Bank alight.” Argaman also voiced concern that the bill could harm his agency’s ability to use Israel’s policy of “administrative detention” as an instrument of investigation, as the courts could view detention as unnecessary if the forced relocation of convicts’ families is an option. After an exhausting debate, even though attorney general objected, cabinet approved the bill before passing it on to the ministerial committee for its approval. Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked of the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi were major players in pushing the bill to pass. Previously, it was  illegal  to expel assailants' family members to other areas of the West Bank, unless they themselves engaged in any type of attack, however, now the bill allows the IDF Central Command chief to expel Palestinians whose relatives have been convicted of violence to be forcibly relocated within seven days from the date of the incident. Shooting near West Bank killed 2 Israeli soldiers  The bill’s approval comes after the shooting when a Palestinian got out of a car and opened fire at a bus stop outside a West Bank settlement on Thursday, killing two Israeli soldiers before speeding away.  Hours later, the army said it shot and killed a Palestinian man who attempted to ram his car into soldiers on a West Bank road. Thursday's bloodshed extended a violent week that began with a shooting outside a West Bank settlement on Sunday, resulting in the death of a baby who was delivered prematurely following the weekend attack, and continued with the killing of two Palestinians. While the West Bank experiences occasional deadly violence, often between Israeli troops and Palestinian protesters, most of the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in recent months has been concentrated in the Gaza Strip, where some 175 Palestinians have been killed by border protests. “Whoever harmed us will be held responsible”  Speaking at a military ceremony, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to ""settle the score"" with the attacker who killed the two soldiers. ""Our guiding principle is that whoever harms us or tries to harm us will be held responsible,"" he said.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned last week’s round of violence, criticising both attacks and the tough Israeli response.In a statement, Abbas' office accused Israel of creating a ""climate"" conducive to violence through its frequent military operations in Palestinian cities. He also accused Israel of incitement against him.""This atmosphere created by the frequent Israeli raids of the cities, and the incitement against the president and the absence of the peace hopes, lead to this series of violence that both people are paying the price for,"" the statement said.Facebook blocks page of Israeli PM’s son for Islamophobic statement Facebook temporarily blocked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's eldest son, Yair's profile, after sharing a banned post on twitter, calling for ""all Muslims to leave"". Facebook blocked his page for 24 hours over apparent anti-Muslim posts and Yair called the leading social network a ""dictatorship”. ""Do you know where there are no attacks? In Iceland and in Japan where coincidentally there are no Muslims,"" the prime minister's son wrote. In another post he wrote that there were only two possible solutions for peace, either ""all Jews leave (Israel) or all Muslims leave"".""I prefer the second option,"" he added.His comments came after two soldiers were shot dead on Thursday at a central West Bank bus station near a settlement. Yair Netanyahu blasted the website on Sunday for removing an earlier post in which he called for ""avenging the deaths"" of two Israeli soldiers killed last week and calling for the expulsion of Palestinians. He shared a screenshot of the earlier post in violation of Facebook's community rules.Facebook deleted a post by Netanyahu last week in which he said he would ""prefer"" if ""All the Muslims leave the land of Israel.""Yairis often criticised  for  living in the premier's residence despite having no official role and benefitting from a bodyguard, a driver and other perks. They say the parents of the 27-year-old are grooming him for future political power in an attempt to establish a ruling dynasty. Occupied West BankIsrael captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim the territories for their hoped-for state. The Palestinians want all of the territories back from Israel for a future independent state.The last round of US-brokered peace talks between Palestine and Israel broke down couple of years ago without any progress.Israel, however, continued to expand its settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem despite international criticism from all sides including the United Nations, EU and US."
TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/anti-bds-laws-in-the-us-aim-to-control-dissent-in-israel-12712523,Anti-BDS laws in the US aim to control dissent in Israel,"What worries Israel's occupation-advocates is not what Americans think, but rather, what Israelis think.",6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:18:05.960069,Israel War,TRT World,Middle East,"What worries Israel's occupation-advocates is not what Americans think, but rather, what Israelis think.  An American speech therapist has launched a lawsuit challenging a Texas law that prevents state employees from boycotting Israel. The controversy displays just how much repressing advocacy for Palestinians has woven around American and Israeli politics, harming freedom of expression in both countries and promoting the toxic falsehood that dissent, in either country, has no right to exist.  As a private citizen, Bahia Amawi avoids buying products made in Israel or the occupied Palestinians territories. Working with disabled children in a suburb of the Texas capital, Austin, Amawi lost her job after she refused to sign a pledge not to participate, or even advocate for, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.  BDS seeks to pressure Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, but critics charge it unfairly singles out Israel, or that it’s even anti-semitic.  Amawi appealed to her supervisor, but he said it was out of his control. Unable to renew her contract, she had to give up her job.  “I couldn’t in good conscience do that,” Amawi told The Intercept, which first reported her story.  “If I did, I would not only be betraying Palestinians suffering under an occupation that I believe is unjust and thus, become complicit in their repression, but I’d also be betraying my fellow Americans by enabling violations of our constitutional rights to free speech and to protest peacefully.” Her federal lawsuit questions what bearing her personal views on Israel have on her ability to help kids in need. Her specialty is working with bilingual Arabic-speaking students; a rare skill now lost to the public.  The suit also makes a clear case that Texas’ anti-BDS law infringes on Amawi’s right to freedom of speech, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US Constitution: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Amawi’s lawsuit argues that Texas’ law contradicts those words. In the United States, each state has its constitution, but these individual constitutions cannot contradict the federal Constitution and its amendments.  The First Amendment does not include an exception saying “except for Israel boycotts, those should be illegal.”  But at least 26 states have passed laws prohibiting state funds from touching BDS, according to Palestine Legal, an advocacy group. A federal law is even in the works, which could place severe financial penalties on BDS activism. At the same time, federal courts have struck down or questioned the constitutionality of other state-level anti-BDS laws.  These blatantly unconstitutional laws have come into force with the support of the American Israel Political Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the blessing of the Israeli government, too.  But what is Israel so afraid of? How could someone's decision not to purchase a bottle of olive oil or wine made in a settlement be such an offense? What worries Israel’s occupation advocates isn’t what Americans think, it’s what Israelis think. Despite the technical difficulties we are experiencing, with a president who may or not be literate, the United States is still the largest and loudest cultural megaphone on the planet. What worries them is that if Americans start to express their displeasure with Israel, it will encourage Israeli dissidents to express theirs, too.  BDS might be an annoyance, but what angers the genocidal right-wing in Israel are left wing, peacenik Israelis, whom the right-wing sees as traitors. Former Israeli soldiers who speak out against the abuses of the occupation earn particular scorn and accusations of “spreading lies.” Anti-BDS laws in the United States are a reflection of Israel’s broken charade of democracy. That these laws represent the outsized influence of the Israel Lobby in the US is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. What’s going on in Israel lies beneath the surface. Making sure these streams don’t cross, BDS in the US and anti-occupation sentiment in Israel is a top priority for the current Israeli government. That’s part of the reason why Benjamin Netanyahu was so pleased that Donald Trump won the presidency. He’d have a hammer in the White House to beat down dissent in the US, and, by extension, back in Israel, too.  Netanyahu’s political coalition in the Knesset is strong, for now, but a resurgence of leftist factions could break it. Even though that’s unlikely, as Israelis leave their country behind, it’s clearly what keeps Netanyahu and his Likud party leadership up at night. And what does Israeli dissent look like? Well, it’s pretty clear-cut. There is a substantial difference in outlook between iPhone-scrolling Israelis who dine in Tel Aviv’s cafes and Uzi-armed Israelis who till the soil on West Bank settlements. To put it mildly, they resent each other quite deeply.  Consider a recent column in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz by Gideon Levy, a critic of the occupation, writing about settlers killed or injured in recent attacks by Palestinians, in a piece titled “I Feel No Sympathy for the Settlers.”  “They are to blame, not I, for the fact that I cannot feel the most humane sense of solidarity and pain. It’s not just that they’re settlers, violators of international law and universal justice; it’s not just because of the violence of some of them and the settling of all of them – it’s also the blackmail with which they respond to every tragedy, which prevents me from grieving with them. But beneath the veil of sanctimonious and hypocritical unity, and the media’s fake show of national grief to advance its own commercial goals, the truth must be told: Their tragedy isn’t ours...The real pain is borne by their victims, those who moan submissively and those who take their fate in their hands and try to resist a violent reality violently and sometimes also murderously. The Palestinians are the victims deserving of pity and solidarity.” Levy’s writing is available on the Internet, in English, for any Texas lawmaker to read. But they probably won’t.  Netanyahu and AIPAC want lawmakers to think that criticism of Israel only comes from outside of Israel, not inside of it. Anti-BDS laws are key to keeping the false narrative of Israeli unity alive.  Disabled Arabic-speaking children in Austin, Texas, now without their teacher, quite literally without their voice, are collateral damage for Israel, caught in the crossfire."

""Erdogan is the voice of oppressed and you [Benjamin Netanyahu] are the voice of oppressors. You are conducting state terrorism,"" the Turkish president said while speaking at a mass opening ceremony in Istanbul's Arnavutkoy district. Relations between Turkey and Israel have been tense this year over multiple issues including a controversial law passed by the Israeli parliament in July which defined the country as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Turkey-Israel ties have been strained even more after Ankara ordered the Israeli ambassador to leave Turkey in May over the killing of protesters along the buffer zone between Gaza and Israel.  ""Israel has no right to accuse anyone without accounting for its own sins, crimes against humanity, massacres, and destruction,"" Erdogan said. On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, on his Twitter account, attacked the Turkish president over Turkey's counter-terror operations in Syria and Cyprus issues. Turkey's operations in Syria President Erdogan on Friday postponed a military operation into Syria against terrorists.  Turkey's planned operation east of the Euphrates River would follow two previous cross-border operations into Syria – Operation Euphrates Shield and Operation Olive Branch – which were both aimed at eliminating PKK-YPG and Daesh terrorists from Turkey’s borders. The YPG is the PKK's Syrian branch and a point of contention between Turkey and the US since Washington is supporting the SDF in Syria, a coalition of anti-regime and anti-Daesh forces dominated by the YPG. Turkey, the US, and the EU recognise the PKK as a terrorist organisation. More than 40,000 people, including women and children, have been killed since the PKK launched its violent terror campaign in Turkey in 1984.

Demonstrators rallied at the American Museum of Natural History to mark the anniversary of the official end of the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict and marched to Columbus Circle demanding and end to U.S. support for Israel. (Photo by Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) Last week Bahia Amawi, a speech pathologist residing in Texas, challenged the constitutionality of her employment contract with Pflugerville Independent School District in a lawsuit in federal court. Amawi, a Palestinian-American, had been contracting with the school district for the last nine years to provide assessments and support for the growing Arabic-speaking community. This year, however, the school district added an addendum to the contract, stating that, ”Ms. Amawi affirms that she does not currently boycott Israel during the term of the contract.” Amawi refused to sign the addendum, leading to the termination of her contractual relationship with the school district. The contractual addendum stems from a 2017 law passed in Texas, barring the State of Texas from entering into government contracts with companies which boycott Israel. In other words, any entity participating in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement would be barred from contracting with the government of Texas. BDS is a non-violent grassroots, and global movement modelled after the boycotts and sanctions against apartheid South Africa. The core demands of BDS are that Israel ends the occupation, dismantle the wall, recognise equal rights of Arab citizens of Israel, and honour the Palestinian refugees right to return. The thirteen-year-old movement, in true David and Goliath fashion, has created a momentum of pressure on private companies, institutions and governments to uphold the sanctity of Palestinian life and dignity. Using language similar to that of Texas, Maryland Senator Ben Cardin is leading an effort to introduce an anti-BDS measure on a federal scale by sneaking a “bill criminalizing politically motivated boycotts of Israel” into an omnibus spending bill that must pass to avoid a government shutdown. Veteran Senators Bernie Sanders and Dianne Feinstein urged Congress not to include anti-BDS measures in the spending bill, stating that though they do not support the BDS movement, they must uphold the “constitutional oath to defend the right of every American to express their views peacefully without fear of or actual punishment by the government.” Though the Palestinian exception to the First Amendment is not new, this latest erosion of political speech and association is surprising in its unabashed transparency to undermine the US Constitution. Amawi, a United States citizen and taxpayer has no control over the dispersal of her taxes, or that in 2016 her government pledged $38 billion to the state of Israel throughout the next decade. This despite Israel’s documented history of human rights and humanitarian law abuses. At the very least, Amawi should be free to determine her political advocacy and any direct action stemming from her political beliefs as a Palestinian American. Indeed, no one exercising their rights to freedom of speech and association should face governmental sanction or criminalisation for doing so. A recent poll shows that support for Israel amongst US liberals, millennials, and women is decreasing. This shift is evident in Congress as well. For example, two newly elected Congresswomen, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, have publicly endorsed the BDS movement and Tlaib and incoming Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez refused the AIPAC-affiliated trip to Israel. Even as support for Israel wanes in the American public, both federal and state governments seek to mandate a pro-Israel loyalty oath. Subverting the constitution to promote allegiance to a foreign country exposes just how far the United States’ toxic relationship with Israel has become."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a ceremony in Jerusalem on December 24, 2018. Israel will hold an early general election in April, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday, after members of his governing coalition met to discuss differences over legislation. ""The leaders of the coalition decided unanimously to dissolve parliament and go to a new election in early April,"" the spokesman wrote on Twitter, quoting from a statement issued by Netanyahu's political partners. A coalition crisis over a military conscription bill affecting exemptions from compulsory service for ultra-Orthodox Jewish men led to the decision. Netanyahu, now in his fourth term as prime minister, has been governing with a razor-thin majority of 61 seats in the 120-member parliament. He heads the right-wing Likud party. Under Israeli law, a national election had to be held by November 2019. Netanyahu's government would remain in place until a new one is sworn in, after the April poll. Corruption probes against Netanyahu A series of corruption probes against Netanyahu and pending decisions by Israel's attorney general on whether to follow police recommendations to indict him had raised speculation he would opt to seek a public show of confidence at the ballot box. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the cases and has given no indication he will step down if charged. The 69-year-old Israeli leader made no immediate comment after his meeting with the coalition leaders. Recent opinion polls have shown his popularity remains strong among Israelis. The likelihood of an early election increased in November after Netanyahu’s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, quit the government, leaving the ruling coalition with its one-seat majority. No official challengers No one in Netanyahu’s Likud has made a public challenge against him, and the party is expected to close ranks around him in the coming election. Outside Likud, Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid opposition party, is seen as the strongest candidate to succeed Netanyahu in any upset. Lapid’s party is second to Likud in opinion polls. Israel’s former army chief, Benny Gantz, is seen as a dovish potential candidate who could tip the balance in favour of a center-left bloc, but has not yet thrown his hat in the ring. On the right, Lieberman and Naftali Bennett, head of the Jewish Home party, could both seek to lead a right-wing bloc if Likud emerges in a weaker position in an election. Netanyahu first led Israel from 1996 to 1999, and returned in 2009. His current government has been in power since May 2015. "

The ministry, which did not specify which flights had been threatened, added that Syrian air defences had destroyed 14 of 16 Israeli missiles launched against unspecified targets near Damascus late on Tuesday. 'The aggression is still ongoing' The reported attack near Damascus is the first since US President Donald Trump announced last week that the US will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in Syria, a move that will leave control of the oil-rich eastern third of Syria up for grabs. Nearly an hour after the attacks began, Damascus residents could still hear the air defence units firing toward targets in the air. ""The aggression is still ongoing,"" said a presenter on state TV, which interrupted its programmes to air patriotic songs. Meanwhile, Israel's military spokesman unit also reported action, though it did not confirm air attacks.  It said in a statement that ""an aerial defence system was activated against an anti-aircraft missile launched from Syria."" No damage or injuries were reported by the Israeli military.

Russia announced it had delivered the S-300 air defence system to Syria in October.  That followed the September 17 downing of a Russian reconnaissance plane by Syrian regime forces responding to an Israeli air strike, a friendly fire incident that stoked regional tensions."

The governing Likud party of Netanyahu seems to be ahead in the polls but Netanyahu isn’t as popular. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends an annual state memorial ceremony for Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, at his gravesite in Sde Boker, Israel November 14, 2018. Israel’s three main TV stations published polls on Tuesday to that predict that the governing Likud party is expected to receive the highest votes. This announcement comes one day after the government declared that early elections will be held on April 9 coming year. As a reaction to the ceasefire agreement the Minister for Defence, Avigdor Lieberman resigned from his office and also from the coalition government. PM Benjamin Netanyahu is the chairman of the Likud party and another victory could likely ensure another term for ‘Bibi’. The poll results of one of the three TV stations sees the Likud gaining between 27 and 31 of the 120 seats in the Knesset. In the previous parliament they held 30 seats. Any slight differences can change a coalition structure since the current government only had a 61 to 59 majority. According to News Company’s poll, 52 percent of voters do not want to see Netanyahu as prime minister. Netanyahu’s unpopularity Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has come under fire after the ceasefire deal with Palestinians in Gaza at the end of November, and the corruption scandal he is currently embroiled in. Over 70 percent of those surveyed by The Israel Democracy Institute perceived the government to be corrupt.At least 19 percent of the respondents thought Israel's leadership was ""quite corrupt"" while 28 percent said it was ""very corrupt.""  Only six percent of respondents thought the leadership was ""not at all corrupt.""And while the investigations into Netanyahu continue, some ask whether “Israel will elect a corrupt Prime Minister?""There are four corruption allegations against the far-right politician, known as cases 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000. In these cases, Netanyahu is accused of bribery, fraud, breach of trust and misuse of state funds. Coalition partners are troubled with it and that is why-among other reasons-they wanted early elections. Weak opposition It seems that the Likud party will be the victorious party after the elections in April - according to several polls. The strongest party after the Likud are the Zionist Union - an alliance between the Labour party and the Hatnuah. The alliance was formed in 2014 to unseat ‘Bibi’. However, as a centre-left alliance, they have internal disputes about leadership and other issues. Even though the Hatnua party leader Tzipi Livni reached out to Avi Gabbay - chairman of the Labour party - to contest polls together, with Gabbay as their leader - the left has historically had a tough time getting votes in Israel. The strength in Netanyahu's policies and the weakness of leftist parties lies in their security policies.  Since 1977 the majority of governments in Israel have been from right-wing parties. Leftist parties focus on finding a new agenda, and to 'takeover' Netanyahu’s argument on security policies by criticising the PM’s stance on the Gaza ceasefire deal.In the end, the opposition might be too weak to replace the Likud party - and Netanyahu the single candidate to become the new-old PM. But a lot of questions are still open."

""We strongly urge Israel to cease such actions,"" Burt added. This week the Israeli authorities advanced plans for over 2000 settlement units across the West Bank. All settlement activity is illegal under international law and undermines the viability of the two state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace. https://t.co/CEh0fv4Yry The European Union also condemned Israel. ""The European Union's position on Israeli settlement construction and related activities is clear and remains unchanged: all settlement activity is illegal under international law"" the statement reads. Illegal settlements Settlements are one of the thorniest issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014. While Israel's settlement projects have regularly drawn condemnation from the Palestinians and in Europe, the US administration under President Donald Trump has taken a largely uncritical public stand. According to Palestinian figures, roughly 640,000 Jewish settlers now live on 196 settlements (built with the Israeli government's approval) and more than 200 settler outposts (built without its approval) across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. International law regards both the West Bank and East Jerusalem as ""occupied territories"" and considers all Jewish settlement-building activity there as illegal."

Banking giant, HSBC, one of the world’s largest financial institutions, will divest from Israel’s Elbit defence contractor over concerns of human rights violations by Tel Aviv, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) said on Thursday. Elbit Systems is one of Israel's largest arms manufacturer making drones, pilot helmet displays, and cybersecurity systems. The move to divest from the arms manufacturer came just weeks after the vacation rental website Airbnb announced it would delist illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.  The Jerusalem Post also confirmed HSBC's decision, citing sources from the bank. “HSBC confirmed to campaigners that it has fully divested from Israeli drone manufacturer Elbit Systems, which sells weapons to the Israeli military used in attacks on Palestinians,” said a source from HSBC, cited by the Jerusalem Post. Ben Jamal, Director of the PSC, praised the decision by HSBC. “This announcement is proof positive that collective campaigning works. Hundreds of people around the UK, including many PSC members and branches, were involved in pushing HSBC to divest from Elbit through pickets, email campaigns, and other actions designed to pressure the company,” Jamal said, in a statement published on the PSC’s website.  The statement said over 24,000 people emailed HSBC highlighting their concern over the bank's investments in Elbit Systems and other companies selling weapons to Israel’s military. “Campaigners vow to continue the campaign, as HSBC maintains business relations with more than a dozen other companies selling weapons and technology to the Israeli military,” PSC added.  Several non-governmental and international organisations including the United Nations have repeatedly warned Israel over its human rights violations, but Israel has always turned a deaf ear, saying the groups have an anti-Israel bias.  For nearly nine months, Palestinians in Gaza have been protesting against the Israeli blockade, demanding the right to return to their lands taken by Israel in 1948.

Benny Gantz, Head of the 'Israel Resilience' party speaks at the campaign opening event of &quot;Israel Resilience Party&quot; in Tel Aviv on January 29, 2019. (Photo by Gili Yaari/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Right after announcing his candidacy, heading up the newly-established Israeli Resilience party and speaking of seeking a solution with the Palestinians, Israeli media agencies went into a frenzy as they  portrayed Benny Gantz as a man with a vision for ‘peace’. Or at least someone that speaks of it.  It is ironic however, that after 10 years in power, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ultra-right wing policies have ensured that anyone who pays lip service to peace is portrayed as a moderate or a peace-seeker. The irony runs deeper, when Netanyahu, who has a personal grudge against the left dating back to his father Benzion Netanyahu’s time, attacked Gantz and called him a defeated leftist, further helping promote the idea that Gantz is serious about peace. Gantz was the Israeli Army’s chief of staff from 2012-2014. He spoke repeatedly, with head held high, of how he eliminated thousands of ‘Palestinian terrorists’ during his professional career. He claimed that 1,364 Palestinian militants were killed under his command during the 2014 war on Gaza, contradicting many official figures as well as numbers provided by the Israeli media itself. Haaretz argued that the number of militants killed was much lower, and that he counted civilians as militants to reach his grim sums.  War Crimes? Under Gantz’s command, Israel has been accused of and sued for war crimes and grievous violations of international law. Palestine referred to the crimes committed by the Israeli army to the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council, heavily criticising the irresponsibility of the Israeli army towards civilians.  Gantz himself faces criminal charges in the Hague, submitted by a Palestinian-Dutch survivor of the Al Burij massacre who lost his mother, three siblings, a sister-in-law and a nephew, despite none of them having anything to do with the battles taking place.   But didn’t all Israeli Oslo leaders commit war crimes? Some might argue that Gantz’s views on peace should be read in isolation from his military experience. After all, most Israeli leaders have come from the military establishment that is responsible for thousands of civilian casualties. Former prime minister Ariel Sharon was responsible for the Sabra and Shatilla genocide, but also undertook the Israeli unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005. The argument to detach Gantz from his military service is dangerous and intrinsically flawed.  First of all, it should be clear by now that the issue has gone far beyond individual convictions and charisma. Politically Israel has shifted so far to the right it would be electoral suicide for any candidate to be ‘soft’ or ‘too generous’ with Palestinians by giving in to their ‘unreasonable demands.’  The Israeli electorate over the past two decades seems to care less about the peace process.  Indeed, for many of them, the peace process is dead on arrival.  What’s the fate of the peace process if Gantz wins? Historically speaking, Israel as a state was established by the left, whose main existential concerns were reduced after the collapse of several Arab armies and securing their rule over the West Bank, particularly Jerusalem, as well as ensuring Jewish racial domination over Palestinians.  This is no good for Israel’s right.  Since it came to power, the right has refused to accept the fact that Palestinians have not ceased to exist. In this sense, they see the peace process framed by the exigencies of security. The ‘solution’ they are trying to reach does not in any way give Palestinians their rights, but rather is about giving up on Palestinians.  Most of the Israeli political spectrum percieves and arguably believes that Palestinians are a ‘demographic time bomb’ and a ‘racial risk’ to the ‘purity’ and ‘Jewishness’ of Israel.  Palestinian Arabs who survived the ethnic cleansing of 1948 make up 20 percent of the Israeli population, and the overall number of Palestinians - both Muslims and Christians alike - living within the historic/mandate Palestine now outnumber Jews.  This is critical. Therefore, for the Israeli left, the solution is a militarily impotent, economically enslaved, semi-autonomous Palestinian political entity taking away the Palestinian demographic headache with it.  For the right, however, this is too much.  ‘Palestine already exists’, they believe. But on the other side of the bank (i.e. Jordan) - Palestinians can go live there at any time. The internationally-denounced illegal settlements became a national project under successive right-wing governments, and were even taking place under the rule of the left. Previously, in the first and second Palestinian intifadas, the security issue was a driving concern crystallising Israeli public opinion towards giving the Palestinians a political solution to ensure Israel’s safety. But even at its peak, at the time of former president Shimon Peres, it came nowhere near the hopes and aspirations of Palestinians.  Now that they have a municipality-esque Palestinian government in the West Bank maintaining security, this concern has all but disappeared, and with it their commitment to any political solution.  One obstacle remains: Gaza. The solution to this was to tighten the siege and begin isolating it from the West Bank so that Palestine, as a single political unit, would cease to exist. With Trump occupying the White House, this became feasible.  Where to from here, for peace? Arguing that the peace process would be better off under a left-wing or centre-left government in Israel, ignores the fact that when it comes to dealing with Palestinians, Israeli politicians are all a cut off the right wing. There is a consensus in Israel that all the reasons that ever existed for reaching a solution with the Palestinians have since ceased to exist. Sharon’s main arguments during the disengagement from Gaza were mainly about security; along with the ‘demographic threat’ they posed.  The regional element, since exhausted by the Arab Spring, has disappeared altogether, and the US, once superficially committed to ‘peace’, has officially told the Palestinians to drop dead.  Palestinians, suffering from the siege and the drawn-out political and geographic division orchestrated by Israel, seem to be of minimal concern.  If we want to realise the future of peace, a change in the behaviour of those who can affect the course of action is needed. Palestinians, obviously cannot. The Israelis, under the current circumstances, could not care less."

Benny Gantz, a former Israeli armed forces chief and head of Israel Resilience party, delivers his first political speech at the party campaign launch in Tel Aviv, Israel on January 29, 2019. The leading challenger to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a published interview on Wednesday that Israel should ""find a way"" to end its control over the Palestinians. Former military chief Benny Gantz made the comments in an interview with the Ynet news site. It was his first interview with the Israeli media since his maiden political speech last week. Gantz, a tall, telegenic former general, has shot up in opinion polls since last week's speech. Leading a new centrist party called ""Israel Resilience,"" he has emerged as a formidable challenger to the front-running Netanyahu in April 9 elections. He has so far said little about the Palestinian issue, or whether he supports the establishment of a Palestinian state. But in Wednesday's interview, he said the continued rule over the Palestinians is not in Israel's interest. ""We need to find a way in which we're not controlling other people,"" he said. Palestinians welcome Gantz's comments With peace talks frozen throughout most of Netanyahu's decade-long rule, Gantz's comments were welcomed by the Palestinians. ""It's encouraging if he succeeds and he sticks to this opinion,"" Nabil Abu Rdeneh, spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas, told reporters. In the interview, Gantz was asked whether he favored another unilateral move similar to the Gaza pullout, which is widely seen as a failure in Israel. Two years after the pullout, the Hamas group seized control of Gaza. Gantz said the withdrawal was a ""diplomatic move"" by the government that was carried out in a ""painful but good manner."" ""We need to take the lessons learned and implement them elsewhere,"" he said. His opponents quickly lambasted him. Netanyahu's Likud Party warned that Gantz would form a ""leftist"" government backed by Arab parties, while the hard-line nationalist ""New Right"" party claimed that Gantz is planning on ""expelling"" more Jews from their homes. Gantz's party later put out a clarification saying ""no unilateral decisions will be made on settlement evacuation."" While Gantz strikes a reconciliatory tone ahead of the elections, his past says something else about him. TRT World looks at his career as a military commander. The interview came as Likud held its primary election to select its list of candidates for the parliamentary election.  In a setback to Netanyahu, his chief internal rival made a strong showing, despite a campaign by the prime minister to sideline him."

It will be their first face-to-face meeting since November and follows a series of air strikes in January against what Israel said were facilities belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force in Syria. ""I'll be going on February 21 again to Russia following my discussions with President Putin in Paris a few months ago and subsequent phone conversations,"" Netanyahu said. ""It 's very important that we continue to prevent Iran from entrenching in Syria,"" he said in English, at the start of a meeting at his office with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen. ""This is one of the subjects, the main subject, that I'll be discussing with President Putin.""

The meeting with the Kremlin's Syria envoy Alexander Lavrentiev and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin focused on ""Iran and the situation in Syria"", it said. It came on the heels of January 21-22 Israeli strikes on what the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said were positions and assets held by Iran and its allies in Syria. Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria in the past few years against Iranian and Hezbollah targets, and the Jewish state and Russia have set up a ""deconfliction"" hotline to avoid accidental clashes. That mechanism was stretched when a Russian military aircraft was mistakenly shot down by the Syrian regime's air defence after an Israeli raid in September. Fifteen Russian soldiers were killed and the Russian army accused Israeli pilots of using Moscow's plane as cover to evade Syrian gunfire. As part of its response, Russia announced new security measures to protect its military in Syria, including supplying it with an S-300 air defence system and jamming the radars of nearby warplanes. Both Russia and Israel's arch-enemy Iran are allies of Syrian regime leader Bashar al Assad and have helped his forces inflict numerous defeats on rebels."

for more than a decade. Numerous reconciliation efforts have
failed. Egypt is also trying to prevent an escalation in violence

their posts at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the main
corridor for Gazans. This prompted Cairo, which had in the past year coordinated
operations with the PA, to close the crossing. Gaza officials now say that Egypt has quietly resumed
operations at the Rafah crossing over the past week, this time
working with Hamas. However, there was no immediate comment on
the reopening of Rafah from Egyptian officials. On Sunday, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh passed through the

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence in Warsaw, Poland, February 14, 2019. The Polish Foreign Ministry has summoned Israel’s ambassador in Warsaw over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent assertion that the Poles “collaborated” with the Nazis during the Second World War. According to Israeli media reports, Ambassador Anna Azari was summoned by Poland’s Foreign Ministry, which had conveyed its displeasure with Netanyahu’s remarks. The Israeli Foreign Ministry, for its part, has yet to formally comment on the issue. ""The Poles collaborated with the Nazis and I know the history and I will bring it up,"" Netanyahu was quoted as saying by The Jerusalem Post during his recent visit to Warsaw to attend a Middle East conference. Netanayhu on Friday refused to clarify in person his comments, Haaretz reported. Replying to a Haaretz question whether Poles collaborated with Nazis during the Holocaust, Netanyahu said, “Shir will answer you,” referring to his spokeswoman. Later, his office later issued a statement saying the prime minister had been misquoted by the newspaper, which quickly issued a clarification admitting that an error had been made during the editing process. Nevertheless, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki have both slammed Netanyahu’s reported remarks. “If Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks are as media reports say … Israel is no longer a good place for Visegard Group meetings,” Duda said, referring to a group meeting scheduled for next week in Jerusalem. The Visegrad Group is a cultural and political alliance consisting of Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Duda went on to suggest that Poland might host next week’s meeting instead. Morawiecki, for his part, was quick to stress that Poland had been among Nazi Germany’s victims, noting, “Six million Poles were murdered, including many Polish-origin Jews, during World War Two.” Israel has hosted recent Visegrad meetings as part of Netanyahu’s efforts to forge closer ties with Eastern European states with a view to offsetting mounting international criticism of Israeli policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians."

Israeli news anchor Oshrat Kotler came under fire from Israeli politicians and religious groups after she described soldiers in the occupied West Bank as “human animals”. ""When you send your children to the army, they are kids, you send them to the territories [occupied West Bank] and they come back as human animals, and this is the result of the occupation,"" said Oshrat Kotler, the news anchor for Channel 13 TV. Her remarks came as she presented a report on five Israeli soldiers who have been prosecuted for torturing blindfolded and handcuffed Palestinian detainees with sharp objects. Her words sparked fierce debate on the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and extreme militarisation in Israel and her show went off the air soon after. She has faced a strong backlash from religious figures to prominent politicians including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu directly targeted the news anchor and tweeted: “Proud of IDF [Israeli Defence Forces] and love them very much. Oshrat Kotler’s words should be roundly condemned.” Netanyahu, when giving a speech at the weekly cabinet meeting,criticised the anchor’s remarks again: “I am proud of IDF soldiers. They are protecting us and we are carrying out the supreme humanitarian and moral mission of defending our people and protecting our country against those who want to slaughter us.” He added: “The journalist's words deserve all condemnation.” It was not just Netanyahu who spoke against Kotler, more than 2,000 people complained about the journalist to the Israeli Authority for Television and Radio.   Education Minister Naftali Bennett was among those who responded to Kotler. Bennett tweeted: “Oshrat, you’re confused. IDF soldiers give their lives so you can sleep peacefully.” The minister then demanded an apology, writing: “IDF soldiers are our strength. Our children. Apologise.” However, Kotler’s employer Channel 13, publicly backed the journalist by publishing a statement saying: “Oshrat Kotler is a journalist with strong opinions and she expresses them from time to time, like other journalists on our staff who hold other opinions. Oshrat expressed her personal opinion only.” Kotler, realising the backlash against her, clarified her statement at the end of the show by claiming that she was particularly criticising the five soldiers who tortured Palestinian detainees, not the entire Israeli Defence Forces. “My criticism was directed only at those soldiers who have been driven to harm innocent people due to our control over the Palestinians in the territories,” she said."

Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu look on during the Middle East summit in Warsaw, Poland, February 14, 2019. PRAGUE – With tensions escalating between Poland and Israel, a summit of Central European leaders from the Visegrad group countries (V4) scheduled in Jerusalem has been cancelled, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told state media outlet CTK. The cancelled summit is the latest flare-up in an enduring spat between the two countries over the history of the atrocities that saw the elimination of over 90 percent of Poland’s Jewish population during World War II. The issue began on Thursday as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly said during his trip to Poland that “Poles cooperated with the Germans” during the Holocaust, causing an uproar among Poles, some of whom have denied research supporting the claim.  Exacerbating the situation further, Israel’s newly appointed interim Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz doubled-down on the remarks on Sunday saying: “every Pole suckled anti-Semitism with his mother's milk.” Even though Netanyahu later offered a clarification that he was not referencing the entirety of the Polish nation, his Polish counterpart Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki yesterday pulled out of the summit, telling reporters that the foreign minister’s remarks were “racist and unacceptable”. He later wrote on Twitter: “An important decision to postpone the meeting with Israel shows that the V4 is one and there is no agreement among us for baseless racist attacks on any of the partners.” Morawiecki informed Netanyahu of his decision not to attend by phone Sunday, according to Michal Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery. In his stead, Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz was to attend the summit until the entire Polish delegation pulled out of the trip altogether. “Polish authorities were left with little choice but to cancel Poland’s participation in the summit, said Bartosz Wisniewski, an analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. “Israel’s acting minister of foreign affairs crossed a line that immediately strikes a very delicate chord in Poland: assuming that Poles were complicit in German atrocities during the Holocaust because of their ‘inborn’ anti-Semitism.” While the V4 summit has been cancelled, Babis confirmed that he, Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were already in Israel and would instead hold bilateral meetings with Netanyahu. “We have more or less agreed that the V4 meeting could only be in the second half of this year when the Czech Republic is to take over the presidency,"" he told reporters. This is not the first time that Poland and Israel have been in conflict over the issues surrounding World War II. Last year, Poland introduced new legislation making the use of phrases such as ""Polish death camps"" punishable by up to three years in prison. That legislation has since been watered down after the US intervened in the matter. “This is something that could have hard consequences on international relationships,” said Olgierd Annusewicz, a political scientist at Warsaw University. “You have to take into account that the Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians were solidarity with Poland. It is not Poland who cancelled the summit. It was the decision of the other three members.” He also said that while the consequences of this particular relationship may not wind up having a huge impact, it is at the very least an example of the lengths Israel is willing to go to as it toughens its stance ahead of legislative elections in April. “At the end of the day, this whole situation was driven by internal Israeli politics as they are having infighting between parties,” he said."

Why has Kuwait not followed its closest allies?,6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:18:05.960069,Israel War,TRT World,Middle East,"The most prominent Gulf nations are normalising ties with Israel without gaining any concessions from the Israelis. Why has Kuwait not followed its closest allies?  The Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East (the Warsaw Conference), held on February 14, made the Middle East’s existing geopolitical realities increasingly apparent.  One result of the summit is that in the aftermath of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent trips to Oman and Chad, the Gulf monarchies have given Israel even more confidence in its ability to score diplomatic and political points in the Arab/Muslim world without making concessions to the Palestinians.  By relying on anti-Iranian rallying cries, officials in Tel Aviv seem confident that they can advance toward a cost-free normalisation of relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members. The Warsaw Conference served to embolden Israel in this respect with naturally dangerous implications for the Palestinians. For years there has been a widespread understanding that most GCC rulers see Iran’s conduct as far more destabilising and threatening to their monarchies’ security than any act of aggression that Israel wages against the Palestinians, Syria, or Lebanon. Yet when discussing this issue in Warsaw, Arab Gulf leaders spoke with greater honesty and openness than before, agreeing that “Israel had a right to defend itself against Iranian aggression.”  Bahrain’s chief diplomat went as far as saying that Iran represents more of a “toxic challenge” to the Middle East than Israel’s occupation of Palestine. The veneer of all six GCC states standing in support of Palestinian rights came to an end in the Polish capital. Consequently, diverse Palestinian factions have strongly condemned the Arab Gulf leaders who shared the stage with Netanyahu in Poland and demonstrated their total indifference to the Palestinians’ plight.  Jamal Muheissen, a senior Fatah official, blasted the Warsaw Conference by asserting that US officials “are trying to subjugate the Palestinians and exert political and financial pressure on the Palestinian leadership to force it to accept Trump’s plan to eliminate the Palestinian cause.”  Yahya Musa, a Gaza-based Hamas leader, stated that all Arab officials who attended the summit were “traitors” and that “everything which comes to us from the US aims to liquidate the Palestinian cause, stirs clashes in the region and serves the Zionist and American agendas.” Kuwait, however, is one member of the GCC that refuses to support a thaw in relations with Israel until a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is reached.  Three days after the conference in Poland, the Speaker of Kuwait’s National Assembly Marzouq al Ghanim restated Kuwait’s “principled and firm position” in opposition to normalising ties with Israel, emphasising that Kuwait was one of few Arab states that have not given in to the pressure of warming up to Tel Aviv. In response to a photo from Warsaw that included a Kuwaiti diplomat with other Arab and Israeli officials, Kuwait’s Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled al Jarallah stressed that the group picture signified no change in Kuwait’s position on Israel, declaring that observers have been “mistaken to think that normalization [of relations with Israel] can be reduced to a group picture.” Throughout the past two years, numerous statements and diplomatic manoeuvers against Israel have underscored Kuwait’s independent foreign policy and refusal to join the GCC trend of moving closer to Israel.  When siding with Lebanon at the UN Security Council late last year, Kuwait affirmed that Israel’s Operation Northern Shield was more threatening to the region than Hezbollah. Given Hezbollah-linked groups’ history of waging violence and plotting subterfuge in Kuwait, this position was quite significant and in complete contrast to Bahrain’s government which sided with Tel Aviv against the dominant Shia force in Lebanon backed by Tehran.  When Kuwait was a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, its leadership expressed interest in possibly opening a Kuwaiti embassy in Palestine while also supporting the formation of an international protection force along the Gaza-Israel border to protect Palestinians in the besieged enclave. Anti-Israeli/pro-Palestinian rhetoric from Kuwaiti lawmakers has also further contrasted the Gulf country from its fellow GCC states which have grown increasingly open about their tacit alliances with Tel Aviv. For its part, Qatar has also remained “pro-Palestinian” in its foreign policy in terms of its economic assistance to Gaza and strong diplomatic support for a two-state solution albeit without challenging Israel as Kuwait has throughout 2018/2019.  Shortly after the summit in Poland, Qatar’s Prime Minister declared at the Munich Security Conference that without resolving the Palestinian issue “there will always be a problem” between Doha and Tel Aviv. As Kuwait continues to stand out in the GCC with its position on Israel, the Gulf country is making its displeasure with the Trump administration’s Middle East foreign policy increasingly clear.  In addition to disagreeing with the White House on critical dimensions of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, including the decision made in May 2018 to pull the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iranian nuclear deal), the conflict(s) between Israel and Palestinians/Lebanon further highlight the growing distance between Kuwait and the US administrations’ positions on regional crises. Put simply, while Washington strongly urges the Gulf monarchies to align with a far-right government in Israel that opposes Palestinian statehood and the right of return while also denying the mere fact that there is an Israeli occupation of Palestine, Kuwait refuses to join this bandwagon.  Much like Jordan, Kuwait sees Tehran’s regional conduct as destabilising, yet has no interest in inflating the Iranian threat. Notwithstanding Kuwait’s legitimate concerns about Iranian-sponsored non-state actors in the northern Gulf, in 1990 the emirate learned its lessons about the consequences of failing to balance its larger neighbours against each other in a shrewd manner which influences Kuwaiti officials in their efforts to avoid excessively antagonising the Islamic Republic.  Furthermore, for all of Kuwait’s concerns about Iranian meddling in other Arab states as well as in Kuwait, the Al Sabah rulers do not see the threat of Tehran’s foreign policy as a sound justification for normalising ties with Israel."

The US President Donald Trump, flanked by White House senior advisor Jared Kushner, meets with Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 20, 2017. Although Saudi Arabia and Israel have been in the news for cosying up in the wake of a resurgent Iran, Tel Aviv dealt Riyadh a diplomatic blow by criticising the US government's plan to sell nuclear technology to the Sunni-majority kingdom.  Saudi has a long-standing aim to build both energy and military capacity from nuclear technology, and Riyadh has already signed several cooperation agreements with France and China.  Saudi Arabia and France signed three nuclear-related cooperation agreements in Paris on June 24 2018. One involves carrying out a feasibility survey for the construction of two power reactors in the country and the other two touch upon various logistics. China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) to develop existing cooperation between the two countries to search for and estimate uranium and thorium resources. Since 2018, the US administration has shown an interest in helping Saudi realise its nuclear dream by offering knowledge and workforce to the kingdom. ""We cannot live in a situation where Iran has nuclear weapons and we don't,"" a senior Saudi diplomat was quoted as saying in The Guardian.  Israel turned out to be a stumbling block, however, Tel Aviv objected to the US  transferring nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, even though the two countries have forged an alliance of convenience in light of Iran making inroads into Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, using its militias to change power dynamics in the entire Middle East.  This is not the first time Israel has reacted negatively to Saudi's nuclear ambition. In March 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned US President Donald Trump against selling nuclear reactors to the kingdom. Riyadh had been negotiating the purchase of 17 nuclear reactors with Washington. Trump reportedly refused to entertain Netanyahu's demand as the president felt that if he didn't move fast enough Saudi could fall into Chinese or Russian hands since both countries have shown a readiness to build Saudi's nuclear projects, according to senior Israeli officials.  Starting with the Obama presidency, Riyadh and Tel Aviv worked behind the scenes, away from the media glare, to build relations even though they have no formal ties due to the long-standing Palestinian issue.   Since Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, became Crown Prince in 2017, he has also focused on deepening ties with Israel. In March 2018, Saudi-led Arab nations attended a meeting over the Gaza Strip, organised by Trump administration, despite the Palestinians boycotting it. Although Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud slammed Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, MBS chose to remain mostly silent on the issue. In April last year, MBS also was quoted by US magazine The Atlantic as saying: “I believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land.”   Why does Israel object to Saudi’s possession of nuclear energy? According to a report published by the Jewish Virtual Library, Saudi Arabia is still considered a military threat against Israel. The Israeli state also has concerns about Saudi Arabia’s growing military power, which is being increasingly augmented with sophisticated weaponry worth tens of billions of dollars. Saudi Arabia is also in possession of advanced air missile systems, tanks, warplanes, helicopters and gunships. One of the most sophisticated military powers in the Arab world cannot be dismissed if an anti-Western regime takes over the country, according to the report. Although the threat perception has reduced through MBS’s engagement with Israel to counter Iranian influence, its newfound ally is unwilling to see the kingdom gravitate towards nuclear technology. "

They called on the Palestinian Authority to pay the full salaries of public sector employees in Gaza, governed by Hamas.

Protesters demanded increased electricity supplies to the enclave, where residents receive power in around eight-hour intervals. Protests against Israel  They also demonstrated against Israel's more than decade-long blockade of the Gaza. Israel says the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas, with whom it has fought three wars since 2008, from obtaining weapons or materials that could be used to make them. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 in a near civil war with Abbas's Fatah. Multiple reconciliation attempts aimed at restoring the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to power in Gaza have failed.

White House adviser Jared Kushner, according to US media, aims to brief its regional allies about US President Trump's so-called ""deal of the century"". White House adviser Jared Kushner is visiting Turkey on Wednesday to discuss and promote his Middle East peace plan, TRT World can confirm. Kushner bears responsibility for Washington's Israel-Palestine policy.  He has said he will address final-status issues of that conflict, including establishing borders, during a week-long trip to the Middle East. During his visit on Wednesday, he will meet several Turkish officials.  On Monday, Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the US Middle East peace envoy, met with leaders in the United Arab Emirates and Oman as part of a regional tour to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 'Deal of the century' Turkey and Israel, former allies, expelled each other's top diplomats last May during a row over clashes in which scores of Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces on the Gaza-Israel fence. Turkey has been one of the most vocal critics of US President Donald Trump's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and opening an embassy there. According to the US media, Kushner's tour aims to brief its regional allies about Trump's so-called ""deal of the century"" – a backchannel plan to reach a peace settlement between the Palestinians and Israel. The terms of Washington's peace plan remain vague.  But according to observers, Palestinian refugees will be asked to concede their right to return to historical Palestine, from which they were driven in 1948 to make way for the new state of Israel.  US' pro-Israel bias The Palestinians have refused to talk to the Trump administration since the US president recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. They see the eastern part of the occupied city as the capital of their future state and have said Washington's pro-Israel bias meant the US could no longer be the main mediator in stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. The Trump administration has since dealt a series of blows to the Palestinian Authority, including cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for the Palestinians."

In this Feb. 5, 2019, photo, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., left, joined at right by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., listens to President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech, at the Capitol in Washington. A tweet by Omar has sparked a bipartisan backlash, with some accusing her of being anti-Semitic. The criticism of Ilhan Omar's tweet was bipartisan, with US President Donald Trump, a Republican, saying Omar should resign and the leaders of her Democratic party condemning her language.  On Monday, Omar issued an apology for lack of sensitivity towards Jewish communities for tweeting “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” as a comment on Republican efforts to investigate her for anti-Israel bias.  To clarify, these words are the lyrics to a 1997 song by a performer then known as Puff Daddy, while ‘Benjamins’ is American slang for $100 bills, which feature the face of Philadelphia’s famous philanderer, author, inventor and diplomat Benjamin Franklin, an influential figure in the American Revolution.  Omar, a Somali-born, Minnesota-raised refugee even wrote the word “AIPAC!,” the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, when a journalist pressed her on what she meant by the inflammatory reference to the classic Puff Daddy diddy. Ironically, AIPAC used the opportunity to send out fundraising emails to its members, asking for money to advance its agenda. As the uproar died down after Omar’s apology, The Nation on Tuesday published an honest-to-goodness deathbed mea culpa from a professional lobbyist named Ady Barkan, who wrote that AIPAC members reward lawmakers and candidates, both Democrats and Republicans, with donations in return for their pro-Israel or anti-Iran positions.  As an adviser to a struggling congressional campaign in 2006, Barkan’s candidate, Victoria Wulsin, got $5,000 from AIPAC fundraisers in exchange for incorporating the lobby’s positions into her platform.  “As a Jew, an Israeli citizen, and a professional lobbyist (ahem, activist), I speak from personal experience when I say that AIPAC is tremendously effective, and the lubricant that makes its operation hum is dollar, dollar bills,” Barkan wrote from a hospital bed while watching himself succumb to the motor-neuron disease ALS.  “AIPAC and its associates work to silence criticism of Israel by accusing its detractors of anti-Semitism and claiming that nobody may ever talk about how the Israel lobby uses money to build power,” he added.  It’s all about identity baby  That Omar would be compelled by her party to apologise for saying something so obvious to everyone (i.e. lobbying for anything involves money, by definition) doesn’t have as much to do with what she said but who she is; the first Somali-American Muslim woman ever to serve in Congress.  Omar’s apology received a seal of approval from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, elected in 2018 alongside Omar. The youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez has championed ambitious initiatives as a democratic socialist, calling for free healthcare, housing and education for Americans. She’s also sponsored “Green New Deal” legislation, which would aim to reform the United States away from fossil fuels that contribute to climate change. A summary of her policy positions on her campaign web site does not mention Israel or Palestinians once, although it does urge a redirection of public funds from the military to social services.  “America should not be in the business of destabilizing countries. While we may see ourselves as liberators, the world increasingly views us as occupiers and aggressors. Alexandria believes that we must end the ‘forever war’ by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world,” Ocasio-Cortez’s platform states.  The first Palestinian-American woman ever to serve in Congress, Rashida Tlaib, also elected in 2018 to represent Detroit, Michigan and its suburbs, does not discuss her plans for Israel/Palestine on her website.  Tlaib has however tried to raise awareness about the plight of the Palestinians to her fellow congressional representatives with a trip to the occupied territories. Her plan has encountered resistance from Democratic leadership.  Omar’s platform does mention Israel/Palestine, but the details are vague.  “Stability in the Middle East depends on the establishment of a lasting peace between Palestinians and Israelis,” Omar’s site states. “But without justice, there will never be peace. The United States must work with the international community, and not unilaterally, to work towards a solution. I will use my voice in Congress and work with communities on the ground to centre the ultimate goal of self-determination and peace.” Without a cohesive and comprehensive response to the mainstream, status quo rhetoric on Israel and Palestine, the progressive wing of the Democratic party will be vulnerable to bad-faith charges of anti-semitism, as happened to Omar.  The goal would not be only to counter the tired, status-quo assumptions in Washington on Israel and Palestine, but to replace them entirely.  The progressive left in the US needs to have its foreign policy platform, and it can’t avoid the details any longer. Condemning unequivocal support for Israel’s occupation needs to have a platform that offers an alternative to the tired old tropes repeated ad nauseum in Capitol Hill’s hallowed halls.  The vocabulary of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is stuck in the same year, 1997, when Puff Daddy sang about the value of the aforementioned Benjamins to make anyone care what you do or say. Its wisdom resonates today, as “late capitalism” lurches like an undying vampire into the future. But before pro-Palestinian causes get the money in Congress, there needs to be some kind of powerful alternative vision for the peace process that comes directly from the newly minted progressive representatives in Congress. Without this platform, these candidates will remain at a severe disadvantage when debating US policy towards Palestinians and Israelis.  Although the obsolete mainstream refrains about a “two-state solution” and “Israel’s right to defend itself” might have no basis in reality for Israelis or Palestinians, they remain effective in that they let politicians say something without saying anything at all.  Progressives need to come up with a platform that demands civil rights for Palestinians, an end to the occupation lifts the siege of Gaza and recognises the ecological and environmental factors exacerbating the conflict, as climate change threatens to make water an even rarer resource across the region.  If there ever was a problem crying out for bold, fearless new ideas, it’s the Israel-Palestine peace process. In Congress, so far, nothing is written. "

Demonstrators demand the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in historical Palestine from which they were driven in 1948 to make way for the new state of Israel. They also demand an end to Israel’s 12-year blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has gutted the coastal enclave’s economy and deprived its roughly two million inhabitants of many basic commodities."

This short narrative takes a look at one Palestinian's trip to her homeland. An Israeli border guard looks at the golden cupola of the Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem's old city 15 February 2004. ""Are you a member of khizbollah?"" she asked, ""no,"" I answered. ""Are any of your family members or friends supporters of khizbollah?"", again I answered, ""no."" Nine hours of sporadic questioning, and all because I said I was visiting a friend in Ramallah instead of Jerusalem; my American passport did nothing for me. The assumption I had, on my first and only visit to my homeland, was that my white skin, strong command of English, postgraduate education, and, most importantly, my American passport, would allow me to prance across the Jordan-Israel-West Bank border. I was wrong, all because of a nondescript Lebanese stamp on the corner of one of my passport pages. And so the inquisition began: name, mobile number, marital status, political affiliation, residency card, profession, travel history, Facebook profile (a questionable cover photo: the back of a pickup truck with a bumper sticker, written in Arabic, reading ‘kiss the boo boo'), name of employer, address, future plans; How many babies do you want to have, Nadine? The officers took turns and the fluency of their English varied. I suspected that one or two of the officers were in training but I couldn't be certain; at any rate, I was their practice. After the first hour of a very boring round of questions and answers, the border control officers upped their game. ""Where was your father born?"", ""Gaza"", I answered – there is little point attempting to lie to an Israeli immigration officer. ""And your mother?"", ""Hebron,"" I said. Naturally, this piqued their suspicion of me. What is a young Palestinian woman doing going into Palestine on her own? They returned to their private office and I sat and waited another hour or so while the background check was underway. My father's birthplace is a very contentious place, they wanted the whole story. And so, what choice was left then to divulge my cloudy family history and expose my fractured identity. ""My father was born in Gaza and lived there for a few years, they left through Egypt in 1959 to Lebanon. They took the Lebanese nationality courtesy of my grandfather's attempts negotiating with the authorities. It helped that they were Christian, the Lebanese didn't have a problem with that."" And the Muslims, particularly the Sunni Muslims, were not so lucky, I thought to myself. ""It is terrible what they do to the Christians in the Arab world,"" another fresh faced officer said to me. One of many antagonising attempts, which failed, I smiled, ""It is terrible what is done to every Arab in the Arab world,"" I replied. ""And your mother?"" I was asked. ""My mother is Jordanian, she was born in Hebron was there in 1967. My grandfather used to work in Amman so they were back-and-forth a lot, did you know it's only a one and a half hour drive?"" Disregarding my comment he said, ""So you are Palestinian,"" instantaneously erasing my insecurities for me. ""Yes, I am."" With that they left me once again, to sit amongst the others in bureaucratic purgatory. The room was cold, very cold, and after 5 hours of waiting, was annoyed, to say the least. I paced up and down the room, looking at the other groups of people waiting, some more patiently than others. I sat down beside a friendly looking couple, they were clearly foreigners going in for tourism, and asked them how long they had been waiting. Six hours, they told me and so I asked, why? The woman said to me, ""They gave me my entry stamp, but we are waiting to hear what happens to my partner."" Her partner was a German man of colour, and I was, sadly, not surprised. He said, ""I am originally Somali, but I was born and raised in Germany. I visited Somalia only once in my life. They are asking me if I am affiliated with Boko Haram."" I laughed, and then received a scolding and almost a smack on the arm from the cleaning lady for taking her colleague's seat on the bench. It was marked with a jacket – I deserved it, occupation is illegal. A few more hours and my impatience began to roar, but I knew better than to say anything, I wanted to see where my home should have been. I could not even imagine what it would look like. All I knew was how to live without it. Take a shot at explaining to someone that growing up somewhere does not make you feel like you belong to a place. And that sometimes after living somewhere your whole life, that place does not want you anymore. Or that just because you have a few pieces of paper claiming that a state owns you, that does not mean that you are owned by the state. This narrative is not written to victimize or vilify; it is written as a testimony to the unnaturally broad spectrum of injustice perpetrated by one state on another. There is far worse than border control officers, and many victims of a much more serious nature. This narrative highlights the varied exertions of dominance, and the psychological warfare orchestrated by the state of Israel. It is written because after 50 years of the existence of a singularly subjugated population, the balance still does not seem to be shifting. It is written because Palestine is still occupied. They let me in, but whether I can go back is a different story."

One Israeli soldier has been killed. Palestinians have been protesting along the border since March 30, demanding an end to Israel's blockade of the territory and the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from when Israel was founded in 1948. Picture from October 19, 2018. At least 130 people were hit by Israeli gunfire on Friday as thousands of Palestinians protested near Gaza's border with Israel, the health ministry in the enclave said. Following calls to avoid an escalation in violence, the demonstrators largely kept their distance from the fortified frontier fence. This follows the deaths last Friday of seven Palestinians in the now weekly protests. Since March, Palestinians have marched to the border fence every Friday and occasionally breached it. Israeli forces have killed more than 200 Palestinians in the confrontations. One Israeli soldier has died. According to an Israeli military spokeswoman, about 10,000 demonstrators took part in Friday's protest. An Israeli army spokesman said that most of the protesters stayed back from the fence, but some approached and some threw explosive devices and hand grenades at soldiers while setting tyres on fire. ""The soldiers who were there responded with riot dispersal means, along with gunfire in accordance with the rules of engagement,"" he said. Some protesters launched kites and balloons equipped with crude incendiary devices across the border into southern Israel. The Israeli army said one of its aircraft targeted a group of men launching balloons. An AFP correspondent said Hamas security officials in at least one location were seen discouraging protesters from nearing the fence. Ahead of Friday's confrontation, an Egyptian security delegation visited the Gaza Strip on Thursday and encouraged Hamas leader Ismail Haniya to calm the protests, an Egyptian official said. UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov also urged all sides ""to exercise restraint, to proceed in a peaceful manner, and to avoid escalation."" On Wednesday, two rockets were fired from the Palestinian enclave at Israel, with one damaging a house in the southern city of Beersheba. Israel launched air strikes in retaliation, killing one person. This week's protest was relatively small. Some of the previous gatherings drew as many as 30,000 demonstrators, a sign that tensions that have built up in the past few days may have eased somewhat."

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/how-accusations-of-antisemitism-stifle-academia-in-the-uk-12709599,How accusations of antisemitism stifle academia in the UK,Is the antisemitism debate in the UK is being weaponised to stifle debate on criticising Israeli?,6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:18:05.960069,Israel War,TRT World,Middle East,"Is the antisemitism debate in the UK is being weaponised to stifle debate on criticising Israeli?  The ongoing accusations against Jeremy Corbyn and claims of antisemitism in the Labour Party, the UKs main opposition party, and more recently, racism, show little sign of abating. The lurking fears of the right are slowly being realised, as it would appear that change is indeed on the horizon.  Whenever opinion polls show a lead for Labour, the antisemitism stories start resurfacing again. The discourse of antisemitism has been a central symbol over the past few years to destabilise, delegitimise, and derail the Corbyn project by undermining his historic support for the liberation of the Palestinian people.  Such attacks are part and parcel of the broader political Western landscape, whereby any challenge to Israel’s settler-colonial project is (falsely) treated as a vicious antisemitic attack. The Israeli state, along with its neoconservative allies, has been responsible for pushing an agenda where any legitimate criticism that seeks to call out and expose the systematic human rights abuses and violations of Palestinians is simply deemed antisemitic.  This is a misguided and dangerous path to follow. Not only does it work to erase critical Jewish voices that have also pointed to the way in which antisemitism is being mobilised to deny the agency of Palestinians, but it also functions to shut down and censor wider, analytical debate.  Supporters and opponents of Israel should avoid conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism. To suggest that the two terms are synonymous is unhelpful and only contributes to the continued silencing and criminalisation of any form of valid opposition that pursues justice for the hundreds of thousands of dispossessed Palestinians. Over the years this narrative has steadily seeped into academic institutions across the UK, Europe, and the US.  In the UK, there has been sustained surveillance of ‘pro-Palestinian activity’ on university campuses, heightened by the toxic counter-terrorism Prevent strategy. For example, in order to comply with the policy, it was reported last year that university staff had been advised to “risk assess” and “manage” supposedly “controversial” issues including Palestine. This led to the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), to take the decision to cancel an event organised by a Friends of Palestine society, citing concerns that it would not be “neutral”.  In addition to this, various blacklists of ‘topics’ or ‘speakers’ have been produced, undermining freedom of expression even further. Moreover, various scholars who have dedicated years of research and activism to the Palestinian struggle have faced a torrent of abuse and frequent attempts to shut them down. Universities in the UK have conventionally been assumed to be spaces that emphasise and promote critical thinking - and in times of major global political transformations the cultivation of new, alternative ideas is perhaps more necessary now than ever.  Unfortunately, this appears to be far from the reality on the ground whereby securitisation and censorship are taking a firm grip on educational settings throughout the West. In the UK this has been both legitimised through the expansion of draconian counter-terrorism measures, and bolstered by associated campaigns to redefine, reconfigure, and rewrite the parameters of antisemitism. However, even in universities and states where pro-Palestinian activity is tolerated, there are still wider attempts made to silence academic expression. For example, Professor Ronit Lentin who is based in Ireland has written about, documented, and campaigned extensively on Israeli settler colonialism and racism, and while she has not encountered direct opposition from her university (Trinity College, Dublin), external attempts to silence her persist.  As a result of her important interventions she continues to receive online hate and harassment with insults such as ‘self-loathing Jew’ often thrown her way. This demonstrates that even when academics are not shut down within their own universities, they still face outside threats to their academic freedoms from organised, right wing, settler-supporting groups. The oppressive monitoring, obsessive scrutiny, and ongoing harassment of those who engage with Palestinian issues has become institutionalised within academic spaces and beyond, and this continues to pose real threats to academic freedom (and safety).  Through the suppressing of open debate in such a way, a disturbing and hostile climate is being fostered to stifle dissent and opposition to Israeli state practices, as Lentin (2017) argues, surveillance is no longer solely directed at Israel’s colonised subjects, but has expanded to also monitor and criminalise dissent by Israeli citizens, and criticism by diaspora Jews and the international community. Debate is the foundation of any democracy, however in the current landscape we have witnessed the limiting of free speech and the policing of dissenting voices.  Denying political figures, journalists, activists, and academics the right to challenge abhorrent practices enacted by the Israeli state is a direct attack on our civil liberties, and halts the development of an open society that promotes and values dialogue as an important tool to broaden understandings and shape ideas for progress.  Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and can no longer be denied to the many voices seeking justice for the Palestinian people. In increasingly unstable and unpredictable times we should be expanding our knowledge and channels for debate rather than containing and negating them.  Universities and other civil society organisations can no longer allow themselves to be coerced into succumbing to the wider pressures and intimidations imposed by neoconservative, securocrat bullies.  In troubling times like these the need for academic freedom is essential to help enable us all to navigate the treacherous currents that we face today. "

Palestinians gesture in front of Israeli forces after the forces removed shacks erected by Palestinian activists to protest against Israel's plan to demolish the Palestinian Bedouin village of Khan al Ahmar in the occupied West Bank. Israeli forces have ""illegally"" demolished several shacks built by Palestinian protesters in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The newly-built protest huts are near Khan al Ahmar, a Bedouin village that has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern.  Israel wants to demolish the village and relocate its 180 residents to a site 12 km away.  In a statement on Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority said the decision to raze Khan al Ahmar village consolidates Israel's ""colonial project"" of building ""an arc of settlements"" that would effectively cut off occupied East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank. ""This illegal decision uncovers the colonial DNA of Israel's institutions that work to confiscate Palestinian lands ... effectively alienating it from the West Bank and killing any hopes for a future contiguous Palestinian state,"" the statement said. TRT World 's Caitlin McGee reports from occupied East Jerusalem. Khan al Ahmar is situated a few kilometres from Jerusalem between two major illegal Israeli settlements, Maale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, which Israel wants to expand.  The removal of the Bedouin village enables Israel to cut the West Bank in two. Bedouin The villagers are members of the Bedouin Jahalin tribe, which was expelled from their lands in the Negev desert by the Israeli military in the 1950s.  They were displaced twice more before they settled in Khan al Ahmar, long before the illegal settlements around it existed. The small community of 40 families lives in tents and shacks on what is classified by the 1993 Oslo Accords as Area C, which accounts for 60 percent of the West Bank and is under total Israeli administrative and security control. Last week, Israel's Supreme Court rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the authorities who say the village was built without required permits, which Palestinians say is impossible to obtain because of the expansion of illegal Jewish-only Israeli settlements there. The five new huts removed by the Israelis early on Thursday had been built this week by activists from several rights groups and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in support of the Bedouin community. "

Municipalities and local councils across Israel will hold polls on Tuesday. 'Losing Jerusalem every day' In Jerusalem a small number of Palestinian candidates are running for the council. One of those who withdrew was Aziz Abu Sarah, who had even announced his intention to run for mayor. He said it was time for Palestinians to ""rethink"" their boycott, pointing out that over 50 years Israel had moved around 200,000 settlers into the occupied east Jerusalem. ""We are losing Jerusalem every day,"" he said during his campaign. While he received support from both Palestinians and Israelis, he also faced a series of attacks and at one event was egged. Like most Palestinian Jerusalemites, Abu Sarah has residency –– not Israeli citizenship. He was later told by Israeli authorities that his status as a Jerusalem resident was ""being checked"" due to his travel and work abroad, meaning he could be stripped of the right to stay in the city, he wrote on Facebook. ""Entrenched political interest groups on both sides hope to maintain the status quo, and will stop at nothing to prevent forward progress,"" Abu Sarah said as he dropped out of the race. Public services Among the few Palestinians still in the race is Ramadan Dabash, who heads a list of six Arab candidates running for seats on the city council. He has rare Israeli citizenship and is a former member of the right-wing Likud party run by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A lot of his votes could actually come from Jewish voters, rather than fellow Palestinians. Dabash said he wanted to be on the council in order to protect Palestinians, and denied it amounted to recognising Israel's control of the city – which Israel considers its undivided capital. Palestinians who have residency status rather than full Israeli citizenship can't vote in general elections but can for the municipality, which is responsible for most Jerusalem schools as well as rubbish collection and other services. ""Palestinians pay more than $110 million tax to the municipality,"" Dabash told AFP news agency.  ""They receive less than 10 percent of the services."" Dabash said his mediation had helped prevent the demolition of dozens of homes in his neighbourhood of Sur Baher in east Jerusalem. 'What did the PA do for Jerusalemites?' But Palestinian involvement in the elections has been rejected by the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank. ""Any Palestinian should refuse to be a part of them. We will not accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,"" senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said. ""What did the PA do for Jerusalemites?"" Dabash shot back. ""Did they build them hospitals?"" But in the streets of east Jerusalem there has been no sign of any election campaigning. The four leading mayoral candidates all hold conservative views on issues regarding the area's Palestinian residents. Trader Abu Yasser, from Jerusalem's Old City, summed up the views of many Palestinians, saying he wouldn't vote as the elections wouldn't change much. ""If the Palestinians in Jerusalem knew they would achieve something from these elections they would have gone against the PA's wishes and voted to get municipal services,"" he said."

The central council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) said late Monday it was suspending its recognition of Israel until Israel recognises the State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. Following a two-day meeting in Ramallah, the council said the PLO and Palestinian Authority will also end security coordination and suspend economic agreements as set out under the 1994 Paris Economic Protocol. It also decided to revoke the validity of the Oslo Accords. The council said the decision was made “in light of Israel’s continued denial of the signed agreements”. The decision must be approved by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the PLO Executive Council. The council also called on Palestinian group Hamas to adhere to all agreements that have been reached under Egypt's mediation to prevent divisions between Palestinian factions. A delegation from Egypt’s intelligence service arrived in the Gaza Strip last Wednesday to continue talks with Hamas leaders. The Egyptian delegation has been engaging in shuttle diplomacy between the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel for several days, during which they have been meeting with officials of Hamas, Fatah and the Israeli government. The talks are being held with a view to reaching a truce between Hamas and Israel on one side and achieving reconciliation between rival Palestinian factions.  Wednesday's visit is the third by the Egyptian delegation to the Gaza Strip within a week.  On October 3, a Hamas delegation concluded a four-day visit to Cairo, where they held talks with Egyptian officials on the truce and Palestinian reconciliation.  The rift between Fatah and Hamas has prevailed since the latter won an overwhelming majority in parliamentary elections in 2006 and seized control of Gaza after deadly infighting a year later."

A source from the Omani Royal court speaks to TRT World on the truth behind the changes. A photo posted on Twitter by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Friday, Oct. 26, 2018 shows Netanyahu visiting Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Oman. Israel and Oman do not have diplomatic relations. The meeting was the first between leaders of the two countries since 1996 and former Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin made a similar surprise visit to Oman two years earlier. The recent spate of welcomed public appearances by senior Israeli officials in Gulf countries, following a history of clandestine ties, unveil a shift towards normalised ties with Israel. On October 25, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman for high-profile talks with Sultan Qaboos, days after talks with Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas. His visit to Oman coincided with another visit by far-right Israeli Minister Miri Regev to the UAE.  The visits come as the Palestinian Central Committee voted to revoke recognition of Israel, and suspend security cooperation with Tel Aviv.   ""You have to realise that the GCC's kings, sultans and princes only pay lip-service to the Palestinian issue. It's a means to an end. The Arab people want leaders who are anti-Israel. Their leaders deliver. But these royals couldn't care less about Palestine. It's all a smokescreen. You should hear the way they speak about it,"" a source from the Omani Royal court tells TRT World.  ""It's a joke to them,"" he adds.  ""I'm sure some of them genuinely do [care],"" he notes, ""but those are quickly branded as extremists, and are marginalised or disappear."" When asked what they do care about, he had one word: ""Iran."" ""Iran and its expansion are the only items on their agenda now. Ties with Israel are for sharing intelligence and cooperating militarily against Iran. Any mediation that comes from it is a side public relations benefit to leverage US support."" According to an anonymous Israeli official speaking to the New York Times,  Netanyahu's visit came after four months of quiet discussions, and years of secret relations between Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency and Sultan Qaboos, who overthrew his father in 1970 and has ruled since. A warm welcome for the 'racist' minister While Netanyahu was in Oman, Regev was on a four-day visit to Abu Dhabi.  Regev, a hardline conservative with a reputation for racist, provocative statements even within Israel, attended the International Judo Federation’s Grand Slam in Abu Dhabi. She was welcomed by local officials and given a tour of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque alongside UAE officials the next day. The Israeli minister has often been the subject of controversy, posting a video featuring genocidal chants like, ""may your village be burned"", and calling migrants ""a cancer"". WHAT A SHAME !!!Israel's Minister of Culture and Sport made an official visit to the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi with UAE Minister. This is the same Miri Regev who described the Muslims call to prayer, Adhan, as the sound of the ""crying dogs of Muhammad"".@QudsNen pic.twitter.com/LQ8z8nFwYR Out of the shadow, into the light Calling the Israeli-GCC rapprochement a 'thaw in relations', might be an understatement, given that they have existed for some time but were simply kept clandestine. Recent events, however, hint at a bolder move towards normalising ties with Israel, largely kept under wraps out of fear of public opinion. This has become all the more pressing in the post-Arab Spring Middle East. “I will say this for the first time: Israel is a state that is present in this region, and we all know this,” said Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin Alawi in Bahrain on Saturday.  Saudi Arabia reportedly purchased over $250 million worth of spy equipment from Israel, according to an exclusive report from Al-Khaleej Online.  The deal, mediated by the US and included training a Saudi team in operating the state-of-the-art espionage equipment, as well as strategic military exchanges.  But the deal is by no means the first deal the Saudi Kingdom has entered into with Israel.  A diplomatic source claimed in mid-September that Saudi Arabia had purchased the Israeli Iron Dome defence system to defend itself against Houthi rebel missile attacks.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also previously stated that Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land, in an interview. The statement contradicts Saudi Arabia's insistence that normalising relations with Israel requires Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. In August 2018, the UAE contracted the secretive Israeli NSO Group to spy on dissidents, turning their phones into surveillance devices through the use of spyware.   Bahrain itself publicly backed Israel's right to defend itself in a tweet by its top diplomat in May 2018. During Regev's visit Israel’s national anthem, Hatikvah, was played for the first time in the Abu Dhabi, a further sign of the ties becoming formalised. The United Arab Emirates still has no 'official' ties to Israel. “We made history. The people of Israel live!” Regev tweeted tearfully after the anthem was played. At the same time, Israeli Communication Minister Ayoub Kara attended a conference in Dubai on Monday, October 29, while Transportation Minister Israel Katz plans to attend a meeting in Oman next week A larger strategy in the making? ""Israel is a state present in the region, and we all understand this,"" said Oman's foreign minister, following the meeting.  ""The world is also aware of this fact. Maybe it is time for Israel to be treated the same [as others states] and also bear the same obligations."" Only last month, UAE Ambassador Yousef al Otaiba spoke at a summit in New York, alongside Yossi Cohen, director of Israel's Mossad spy agency and Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir. ""Gulf countries, Israel and the countries in the immediate vicinity are the ones at immedi­ate risk [from Iran],"" he stated, finding common ground with Israel through shared anxiety over Iran's expanding geopolitical presence. Otaiba himself reportedly met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last May during a 'chance encounter', where they discussed Iran."
TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/is-israel-stealing-palestinian-cuisine-12710265,Is Israel stealing Palestinian cuisine?,Israel's need for legitimacy means that it is also appropriating Palestinian cuisine.,6 YEARS AGO,2024-10-13 17:18:05.961062,Israel War,TRT World,Middle East,"Israel's need for legitimacy means that it is also appropriating Palestinian cuisine.  Culture is a reflection of each society and community. It can be identified through different factors ranging from traditional heritage, music to art and cuisine, among other elements.  They form the pillars of the identity of nations and countries, but if they are taken away and appropriated by others then what is left of that identity? To this end, ordinary Palestinians including owners of Palestinian restaurants all over the world feel they have a duty to show the rich culture of their people through showing maps, posters, old photographs and handmade crafts decorating the interiors of their dining areas as well as sitting rooms in Palestinian homes.  It is a voluntary individual educational process to raise awareness amongst non-Palestinians and raise awareness to fight all attempts to forge history and most importantly the appropriation of Palestinian cuisine.  Restaurants are like little microcosms of the Palestinian identity and culture. A fierce cultural war often breaks out when Palestinian meals are mislabelled as Israeli ones whether by online or TV ads or at restaurants owned by Israelis. Palestinian culture and life revolves around food in every aspect, whether it is an ordinary day or a special occasion. A few books were written about Palestinian cookery and cuisine; it is a reminder that food and national identity are tied together. Lovers of Palestinian cuisine know where to find their favourite Palestinian dishes in their cities outside Palestine. Not to mention the famous Palestinian cheesy dessert known as kunafaeh. Maramia, is Arabic for sage – an aromatic herb added to tea by Palestinians – it is one of the few places that offer the taste of Palestine in the UK.  The admiration to the Palestinians' cause and struggle is not only limited to politics, but also to their authentic typical meals such as musakhan, maqlouba, mansaf, stuffed vine leaves, hummus, falafel and shakshouka. Cooking styles vary by region, and each type of style and the ingredients used, are generally based on the climate and location of the particular region in historic Palestine and on traditions. Dining in restaurants such as Shakshouka – another restaurant based in central London – makes you identify with a place called home. Seeing posters of icons of the Palestinian struggle such as 16-year-old Ahed Tamimi, Yasser Arafat as well as Muslim and Christian holy places and traditional homemade handicrafts and embroideries. Shakshouka is a typical Palestinian meal; It consists of eggs poached in a sauce of spiced tomatoes, green peppers and chopped onion. These kinds of restaurants serve as a hub to Palestinian communities through which Palestinians tell their stories and the deeply rooted narrative of their nation.   They do this to keep their history alive and to bring people closer to their homeland as well as attracting pro-Palestine supporters and sympathizers to enjoy their time and get a partial taste of being in Palestine while listening to Palestinian traditional music, learn Arabic with a Palestinian dialect or watch live performance of Palestinian folk dance known as Dabkah. While the recipes of the meals vary and are hugely popular Middle Eastern dishes, one thing is crystal clear, you just cannot call hummus, falafel or shakshouka Israeli dishes even if the world's top celebrity chefs try to convince you they are. Simply put Israel was established in 1948 at the expense of the Palestinian people, who were made refugees scattered all over the world until this moment. A big percentage of Israeli society consists of Arab Jews who migrated from Arab countries after the formation of the nascent state of Israel some 70 years ago. They brought with them ""Arabic"" authentic meals from countries such as Iraq, Morocco and Yemen. The argument revolves around naming the dishes as Israeli, whereas calling them at least Middle Eastern or Levantine dishes would just calm the fumes a bit. Palestinians often refer to attempts to appropriate their culture and cuisine as ""Israeli forging strategy"" aimed at stripping them of their identity through the theft of their cuisine as if occupying their land was not enough. They have a valid point as many would agree. The endless propaganda efforts in which Israeli claims to Palestinian cuisine cannot just change facts because they have no historical base.  Inviting celebrity chefs to cook meals and branding them as Israeli will not succeed in convincing the world that falafel is Israel's national snack! All these deliberate and decades old strategies will not erase Palestinian identity and culture.  If you want to taste the real authentic Palestinian cuisine and desserts you need to pay a visit to the old city in East Jerusalem Al-Quds, Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem or Gaza some of the largest Palestinian cities on the Mediterranean under Palestinian control.  If you happen to be in Nazareth, Acre, Jaffa – cities in historic Palestine dominated by Palestinian communities then you have a chance to taste the real authentic Palestinian dishes but be wary and do not be misled if you are told that falafel is an Israeli dish. Palestinians have no sovereignty whatsoever when it comes to their freedom of movement, there is, however, also an attempt to appropriate their food. Turkish kebabs, Lebanese tabbouleh, Moroccan couscous or Philly cheese steak are dishes that no one can argue were appropriated from other nations, but when it comes to Israel’s efforts to present itself as an indigenous Middle Eastern community, that does not resonate, especially if you call hummus ""Israeli khummus.” Palestinians are proud of their food and they are rightly provoked if they see food stalls in markets in Europe or in the US, for example, selling falafel sandwiches branding it as an Israeli national dish. Planting olive groves and citrus orchards and fig trees are part of the Palestinian culture, as olives and pickles are a must on the Palestinian dining table. There is no better taste for Palestinians and their three Levantine counterparts, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon than sitting down to a breakfast that contains zaatar – dried thyme  – dipped in olive oil with a cup of tea with fresh mint or dried sage and if you want to something hearty you can have ful, hummus and falafel.  Cultural appropriation is denial of the existence and heritage of the owners of the land – the Palestinians in their millions inside the occupied Palestinian territories, in refugee camps in Arab countries or in the diaspora worldwide."

The report cited US officials who said Netanyahu described the crown prince as a “strategic ally” in the Middle East. The Post said Egypt's president Sidi had conveyed a similar message.

Strangled and dismembered Istanbul’s Chief Public Prosecutor Irfan Fidan on Wednesday issued a statement outlining how the hit squad strangled the prominent journalist soon after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, then dismembered his body. The Saudi narrative on Khashoggi's death has shifted several times. Initially, Riyadh said he left the consulate alive. Then it said he died by accident during an argument. And later it admitted he had been killed in a premeditated murder. Turkey is calling for an end to the cover-up and demanding that Saudi Arabia reveal who ordered the killing and hand over the culprits for trial in Istanbul."

In the last few years, Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) institutions and Palestinian Authority (PA) leaders have issued many statements or decisions with regards to their relationship with Israel, but never dared to exceed simple lip service. The latest such decision from the Palestinian Central Council (PCC) in October 2018 was to suspend its recognition of Israel, end security coordination and suspend economic agreements, known as the Paris Protocol. However, as far as Palestinians are concerned, this decision is not breaking news. A similar decision was announced at the closing statement of the PCC meeting in August 2018. Also, in March 2018, the PA announced that it was considering suspending its recognition of Israel. Earlier this year, in January 2018, the PCC instructed its Executive Committee to suspend recognition of Israel until it recognises the State of Palestine, based on the 1967 borders, and revokes the decision to annex East Jerusalem and expand settlements. The decision stated: “The Central Council reaffirms its decision to stop security coordination in all its forms and to break away from the relationship of economic dependence established by the Paris Economic Agreement, to achieve the independence of the national economy.” In fact, the decision to end security coordination with Israel originates from a decision made at a PCC meeting in early March 2015. However, despite these announcements, there seems to be a lack of interest in implementing them. Such decisions are not necessarily binding, in most cases they are treated as recommendations to the PLO Executive Committee and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the chair of the PLO and the PA. And this is where the problem lies. Both the PA and PLO are intertwined as they are controlled by the same people. Since the Oslo agreements, the PA has hijacked the PLO and weakened it. The PLO used to be at the forefront of resistance and confrontation with Israel, but has become no more than a shadow organisation which the PA uses to advance its interests. Everyone at the PCC knows that they have no teeth, and therefore it is easy for them to make such dramatic decisions knowing that they will not see the light of day. This is exactly the reason why the PLO has lost its stature among Palestinians. However, there are reasons why these decisions are still being made. On the local front, the Palestinian leadership wants to regain declining credibility. The PA wants to maintain the pretense of diplomatic and strategic power, but what it actually does is maintain a state of denial. Leaders know they have no power to implement such decisions, but they keep insisting on their failed politics and tactics, to convince Palestinians of their relevance.  On the international front, the Trump administration’s decisions to move the American embassy, halt United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) funding and close the Palestinian diplomatic delegation’s operation in Washington, plus the massive changes in the Middle East where counter revolutions are winning and power dynamics are shifting, the map of interests is changing. This obviously means that Arab leaders are willing to sacrifice the Palestinian cause for their own interests. The Arab world’s relationship and normalisation with Israel has never been as open as today. Only in the last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was welcomed in Oman, the Israeli sports minister and the Israeli Judo team were welcomed in Abu Dhabi and the Israeli gymnastic team was welcomed in Qatar. These are not random incidents. Something is cooking and it is not in the interest of the Palestinians. Amid all this, the Palestinian leadership wants to remain relevant and use these decisions as diplomatic leverage. However, its dependence on financial aid from these Gulf countries, and in general on donor aid and collected taxes from Israel (a method enshrined by Oslo economic agreements), has deprived the leadership of free political will. If they are so powerless to challenge any of the above, one should question their ability to uphold any decisions to withdraw their recognition of Israel, end security coordination and suspend any agreement. Throughout all sorts of debates with the leadership regarding ending Oslo agreements, or security coordination, it has always claimed that these were unrealistic demands, that one can’t end security coordination or Oslo “just like that”, without alternatives. Ironically for three years now, they have been telling us they will end it “just like that”. If it were serious, the leadership should tell the public what that really means. How will it be implemented? What will that entail? How does it intend to face international pressure? What will be the consequences? And how will the leaders practically face these consequences? It needs to convince us with an honest intention and a serious plan. Until then no one will have faith in any of the decisions made by the PLO and Abbass."

Edward Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency, leaked thousands of classified documents to the press in 2013 which revealed the vast scope of surveillance of private data put in place after the 9/11 attacks. Software made by an Israeli cybersecurity firm was used to track murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a former US National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower claimed on Wednesday. Addressing a conference in Tel Aviv, Israel via a video call from Russia, Edward Snowden said Pegasus spyware sold to governments by NSO Group Technologies was used to track opponents. ""The Saudis, of course, knew that Khashoggi was going to go to the consulate, as he got an appointment.But how did they know his intention and plans?” Khashoggi, a Saudi national and columnist for The Washington Post, was killed on October 2 after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Once inside, he was immediately strangled and then dismembered, according to the Istanbul prosecutor's office. After announcing he was killed, Saudi Arabia has yet to reveal the location of Khashoggi’s body. Khashoggi's friend targeted  Snowden said the smartphone of one of Khashoggi's friends, who was living in exile in Canada, had been infected with NSO's Pegasus spyware. He said the software allowed the Saudis to collect information about Khashoggi. ""The truth is that they pursued some of his friends through a programme written by the Israeli company."" A report issued by Canadian research institute Citizen Lab said: ""We have high confidence that the cellphone of Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist and Canadian permanent resident, was targeted and infected with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware."" World's most powerful mobile spyware The software, which allows almost unlimited surveillance of mobile phones, is seen as the world's most powerful mobile spyware application. Snowden highlighted Israel's high-tech capabilities, but warned that accepting too much government surveillance and too easily acceding to the argument that it is needed for security reasons posed serious risks. ""If we can allow ourselves to be terrorised by someone with nothing but a knife, to reorder our societies for the convenience of state power ... we've stopped being citizens and we've started being subjects,"" said Snowden Snowden, who leaked thousands of documents detailing a long-term surveillance program by the US government, was granted asylum by Russia in 2013 after the US charged him with espionage. His residence permit in Russia was extended until 2020."

Palestinian civil servants formed long queues in blockaded Gaza on Friday to receive Qatari-funded salaries, as part of efforts to ease tensions in and around the impoverished territory. A total of $90 million is to be distributed in six monthly installments of $15 million, according to authorities, primarily to cover salaries of officials working for Hamas, that governs the Palestinian enclave. Some exited post offices, where the first installment was being distributed, to show off hundred-dollar bills before the cameras. The cash was driven into the Palestinian enclave through Israel late Thursday by Qatar's envoy to Gaza, Mohammad al Emadi, AFP news agency said, quoting a government source in Gaza. In an Israeli-approved deal, Qatar has started buying additional fuel for Gaza's sole power station, allowing planned outages to be reduced to their lowest level in recent years.

After Hamas wrested control of Gaza from rival Palestinian faction Fatah in 2007, it appointed roughly 40,000 new government employees to govern the coastal enclave. The public-sector salary file is one of several issues that served to derail a recent Fatah-Hamas reconciliation deal after the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority refused to pay the salaries of Gaza's Hamas-appointed civil servants. In October last year, the two factions signed a landmark reconciliation agreement in Cairo aimed at ending years of animosity. The agreement, however, failed to bear fruit due to ongoing differences – both political and ideological – between the two movements."

Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip announced an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire with Israel on Tuesday after a severe escalation of violence threatened to descend into a full-blown war. The groups, including Hamas, issued a joint statement saying they would abide by the ceasefire as long as Israel did the same.  Israel had not commented on the announcement.

TRT World's
Iolo ap Dafydd has the latest. Renewed violence in the Palestinian enclave threatened to thwart efforts to end months of unrest as Israeli air strikes killed Palestinians and destroyed a Hamas TV building while a barrage of rocket fire from the enclave left one Israeli dead on Tuesday. At least 14 Palestinians were killed in Israeli raids triggered first by a botched Israeli operation on Sunday. Seven people, including a Hamas commander, were killed in that attack. An Israeli soldier was also killed in the fighting.  Since then Israel escalated its aggressive assault with two successive days of attacks by warplanes, helicopters and tanks, which continued on Tuesday. The fighting casts doubt over recent deals brokered by Egypt and UN officials to reduce tensions.  Stop attacking Gaza – Turkey tells Israel On Tuesday, Turkey called for end to ""Israel's unlawful, tyranny and occupying attitude"" in Gaza. ""Israel should stop these attacks immediately against the people of Gaza,” Turkey's presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said in a statement.  ""The world should say 'stop' to the invading and expansionist policies of Israel which aims to to turn Palestinian land into an open air prison besides the provocative action of changing the status of Jerusalem. Turkey will continue to support the rightful cause of the Palestinian people."" On Monday, an air strike destroyed the Gaza City headquarters of Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV. Workers had evacuated the building and there were no immediate reports of casualties. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum condemned the bombing as ""a barbaric, brazen aggression.""  Ten minutes later, the station resumed broadcasts, airing pre-recorded national songs. Israel said the station ""broadcasts violent propaganda"" and provides ""operational messaging to militants.”  Thousands of Palestinian mourners buried those killed in Sunday's attack. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh led the funeral prayers.  Wars in Gaza since 2007 Israel forces and Hamas have fought three wars since Hamas seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, in 2007.  In the most recent, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless.  Seventy-three people were killed on the Israeli side. Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover.  The blockade has devastated Gaza's economy.  Unemployment is over 50 percent, the territory suffers from chronic power outages and most residents are unable to travel abroad. For over seven months, Hamas has been leading protests along the Israel-Gaza fence aimed in large part at breaking the blockade.  More than 170 Palestinians, most unarmed, have been killed by Israeli forces during the protests. Israel says it is defending its border against infiltration attempts. Hamas warns of more retaliation  Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the armed wing of Hamas threatened to step up its attacks and fire rockets further north toward the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Beersheba if Israel continued its air strikes. The spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, said the attack on the coastal city of Ashkelon showed the city ""has entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza."" He said Ashdod and Beersheba ""are the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings."" We speak to Palestinian journalist Thaier Abo Oun on the latest developments from Israel's deadly assault on Gaza. In recent weeks, Egyptian and UN mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation. Last week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped government to pay the salaries of thousands of workers.  At the same time, Gaza's government has lowered the intensity of the border protests in recent weeks. However, the recent tension since Sunday appears to be escalating since Israeli forces continue to deploy more troops to near the fence with Gaza."

Is bombing the Palestinians into submission, Benjamin Netanyahu's idea of a negotiation? Smoke and flame are seen during an Israeli air strike in Gaza, November 12, 2018. REUTERS/Ahmed Zakot Israel is quite literally playing with fire. It launched a botched operation 3km into the Gaza strip, whose objectives are still unclear, but which seems to have been an attempted abduction or assassination of a senior member of the Ezzedine Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. The special forces unit used a civilian vehicle, and its members were reportedly disguised in women’s clothes. The alleged target, Nour Baraka was killed, as were six other resistance fighters. Israeli forces lost one of their commandos, and another was reported injured. Things could have been much worse for Israel if it had not been for the overwhelming firepower it used to rescue its forces out of Gaza. Hamas and Israel have since exchanged attacks, with Palestinian resistance groups firing tens of projectiles into Israel with reports of tens of injuries, while in return Israel launched rounds of airstrikes, which targeted among others, the homes of Hamas leaders, including Gaza’s speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmad Bahar. Israel also bombed and destroyed the building that houses the Al Aqsa television station in Gaza City. A 19-year-old Israeli soldier was severely wounded after ""an anti-tank missile"" hit a bus in southern Israel's Shaar HaNegev regional council area, Haaretz reported. Israeli representatives have been laying blame at Hamas’s door for the escalation. However, Israel triggered it, and on this occasion, it is firmly to blame for the death on both sides. The incident is in keeping with Israel’s reputation for negotiating with one hand and murdering with another. It just cannot be trusted. It is not clear why Israel chose this moment to escalate matters. It decided to do this while a truce with Hamas was being negotiated through Egypt, which would have brought some relief to the besieged strip. There was the talk of a sea route from Cyprus to Gaza to be installed to allow relatively free movement of cargo and presumably people in and out of Gaza that the Qataris had been negotiating. The two million besieged Palestinians were enjoying nearly 16 hours of electricity per day for the first time in years. The Qatari Ambassador Mohammed al Emadi brought suitcases full of cash totalling around $15 million to pay for the salaries of Hamas workers, who had not been paid in six months. In return, he could be heard asking a senior Hamas representative to “ensure calm.”  This was an explicit reference to scaling back the Great Return March to the Gaza fence, which has continued unabated since March. Palestinians suffer as the world cosies up to Netanyahu Further afield, Israel was enjoying quite sensational normalisation with Gulf states, with whom it has no official diplomatic ties. Relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia have warmed, even leading Netanyahu to stress the importance of Saudi Arabia’s stability, in what analysts saw as clear reference to protecting the Saudi Crown Prince from any accountability for the Jamal Khashoggi urder in the Kingdom’s Istanbul Embassy.  Benjamin Netanyahu was on the front row for the commemoration of centenary of Armistices day in France. US President Trump’s special Adviser, Jason Greenblatt has been briefing pro-Israel supporters about the long rumored ‘ultimate deal’ which he told supporters of Israel in London would be made public as soon as the beginning of December. Having handed Israeli recognition of Jerusalem as its capital and worked overtime to close UNRWA—both long desired by Netanyahu—it is almost certain the ‘deal’ would provide Israel with more gifts and be impossible for the Palestinians to accept. Israel was winning the diplomatic and PR war, while the Palestinians were increasingly isolated. This makes it even more bizarre that it would seek to ignite a war on Gaza just as it was making such wins. The botched attack forced Netanyahu to scupper home from France to decide on the next steps to yet again punish Gaza for the Israelis breaching a ceasefire or understanding of a ceasefire. As he was on his way, it was reported the Israeli military was requiring Tel Aviv airport to change flight routings in fear of rockets from Gaza reaching its main airport. It seems Israeli leaders are now so certain of complete impunity—not only provided by the West but a normalising Arab world—that it can diplomatically win without any costs while exercising state terror on the Palestinians to perhaps finally beat them into submission. Israel perhaps hopes this will send them scuttling to Trump to accept any deal both in Ramallah and Gaza. Having failed to quell the peaceful Great Return March, Israel is back to her old tricks of crying wolf and painting Palestinians as terrorists to justify its violence. The normalising Arab states should take note. Israel cannot be trusted, especially under the current Netanyahu regime. Whatever calculations Netanyahu and his extremist government made when they sanctioned the attack in Khan Younis, they once again failed to factor in the bravery and resilience of the Palestinian people. As Israeli tanks amass at the Gaza fence, Israel can be sure that yes it can kill tens, hundreds or thousands with its American supplied weapons, but it will not break the Palestinians."

Since Monday evening, the Israeli occupation forces have been heavily bombarding the Gaza Strip, targeting residential buildings, Palestinian resistance bases and government offices. According to the Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza, the Israeli fighter jets have targeted eight civilian buildings since last night, including four residential multi-story buildings, the building which hosts the main offices of Al Aqsa Satellite Channel – run by Hamas – and the headquarters of the internal security services in Gaza. The Palestinian government, UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and the private sector announced closing all their service and education offices to avoid danger of the Israeli attacks, but kept their medical facilities opening with a high degree of readiness to offer emergency medical services. Failed Israeli operation This Israeli escalation came after the Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza had launched tens of homemade rockets towards the Israeli settlement in the peripheries of the Gaza Strip in retaliation of the Israeli killing of seven Palestinians in the east of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Sunday night. Hamas military wing, Al Qassam Brigades, said that its fighters discovered a squad of the Israeli Special Forces three km deep in the city of Khan Younis. “When the Israeli troops felt they were trapped, they opened fire and killed Al Qassam Commander in the east of Khan Younis, Nouriddin Baraka, and his bodyguard,” Al Qassam said in a statement. “The Israeli troops fled immediately under heavy Israeli fire from the sky,” the statement said, “but our fighters chased them, killed one of them and wounded another.” Israeli army recognised this, but kept the name of the soldier, who was killed, unidentified, for security reasons. According to the Israeli media, the Israeli military institution said that the Israeli Special Forces were carrying out an operation of an “utmost importance” for Israel’s security. Palestinian sources said that they attempted to plan spying sets in the secret Hamas telecommunication network, but Al Qassam said that the Israeli mission was to kidnap Marwan Issa, the deputy of Al Qassam's top commander. Israeli security officials said that the Israeli secret operation in Gaza failed. “The Israel Special Forces withdrew to a walled off lot of land, took off their two vehicles and fled away,” an eyewitness told TRT World. “Then, an Israel military aircraft targeted them with heavy fire that completely damaged them,” the eyewitness added. Lost deterrence Israeli media reported that the Palestinian resistance rockets wounded 70 Israelis, most of them sustained light wounds, and killed a 40-year-old man. The former Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz accused the Israeli army of kneeling down to the Palestinian resistance in Gaza. “Today, Hamas defines the rules of the game,” he told the Israeli media. Just an hour ago, the Israeli security cabinet ended its meeting, which was held to evaluate the escalating situation and the potential Israeli measures to deal with Gaza. Nothing emerged about the outcomes of the meeting. Times of Israel, a right-wing Israeli newspaper, reported senior Israeli military officials saying that the army is stepping up, but did not want to call for the reservists. However, the Israeli army have deployed tens of tanks around the eastern Gaza fence. Prior to the meeting, the Israeli member of parliament Moti Yogev said that the Israeli cabinet “is to take strict measures against Gaza.” However, the spokesman of the Israeli Army Ronen Manelis said, “The activities of the Israeli army are connected with the decisions of the political leadership … I do not think that expanding the operation is correct.” Speaking to the Israeli TV Channel 14, Manelis added, “The political leadership will carry out what the political leadership want, but we will propose alternatives.” Ceasefire efforts The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Israeli diplomats saying that Israeli officials are currently working with the UN and Egypt to de-escalate the ongoing tension. The Israeli newspaper stated that UN and Egyptian delegations are going to visit Israel on Wednesday to discuss reaching a ceasefire. However, Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al Qanou said, “No one has contacted Hamas yet. There is no ceasefire deal.” In fact, there are efforts, but Hamas demands international guarantees to ensure no possible Israeli violations. Ismail Ridwan, a senior Hamas leader, said that the world “has to know that Israel is the aggressor and it is the side which violated the truce understanding brokered by Egypt.” Nickolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, wrote on twitter, “UN is working closely with Egypt and all concerned to ensure that Gaza steps back from the brink. The escalation in the past 24 hours is EXTREMELY dangerous and reckless. Rockets must STOP, restraint must be shown by all! No effort must be spared to reverse the spiral of violence.” Since noon, the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian resistance have decreased their fire. Times of Israel said that there are leaks about a ceasefire and Israel Hayom reported an Israeli cabinet minister saying that Israel would punish the Palestinians resistance, but without going for a “war.”"

But Israelis are burning tyres to show their anger at the agreement. Palestinians inspect damaged building after Israeli fighter jets pounded Al Katiba region in Gaza City, Gaza on July 15, 2018. Palestinians and Israelis held their fire late on Tuesday following an Egyptian mediation effort, bringing a relative calm to the Gaza frontier after the fiercest Israeli aggression on Gaza  since the 2014 war. The two sides made clear the pause was an armed stand-off rather than a long-term accommodation. Fighting died down at 1500 GMT and a Palestinian official briefed on the negotiations said Gaza factions ceased firing as part of a deal proposed by Egypt.  Israeli officials confirmed Cairo had been involved in Tuesday's arrangement. TRT World's Philip Owira reports. Since Sunday, Israeli air strikes killed 14 Palestinians and destroyed several buildings used by Gaza's governing political party, Hamas. Rocket attacks from Gaza sent residents of southern Israel to shelters, wounding dozens and killing a Palestinian labourer from the occupied West Bank. Locals have welcomed the ceasefire, but aren't sure how long the ""fragile"" ceasefire will last.  TRT World speaks with Gaza-based journalist Hind Al Khoudary for more. A Hamas official said the violence erupted on Sunday when a group of its members were fired upon by a passing car belonging to Israel forces. Hamas members gave chase and witnesses said during the chase Israeli aircrafts fired over 40 missiles on the Hamas vehicle. Among the dead were Hamas commanders Nour Baraka and Mohammad Al-Qarra, medical officials said. The exchanges that followed were the fiercest since the Gaza war in 2014, the third between Israel and Hamas in a decade as part of the wider Israel-Palestinian conflict.  In that 50-day war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, most of them civilians, along with 66 Israeli soldiers and seven civilians in Israel. 'Taught enemy a harsh lesson' The joint command of the Palestinian armed factions in Gaza said in a statement on Tuesday they would abide by a ceasefire ""as long as the Zionist enemy does the same"". Hamas, which has governed the packed and impoverished coastal enclave since 2007, claimed victory.  Spokesman Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said that they had ""taught the enemy a harsh lesson and made it pay for its crimes"". Israeli security minister Yuval Steinitz said after a cabinet debate lasting several hours that he knew of no formal truce. While many Palestinians celebrated in the streets, in Israel the response was mixed.  Dozens of residents of bombarded southern villages blocked an Israeli traffic junction and burned tyres in protest at what they deemed a government capitulation. According to Israel, more than 400 rockets were fired across the fenced border from Gaza. Responding with dozens of air strikes, Israel hit dozens of buildings including the Hamas-run TV station, Al-Aqsa. Simmering violence Violence has simmered since Palestinians launched weekly border protests on March 30 to demand the easing of the blockade and the right to return to land lost in the 1948 war of Israel's founding.  Israeli troops have killed more that 220 Palestinians during those confrontations, which have included border breaches. Alarmed at the bloodshed, Egypt, the United Nations and Qatar have sought ways to improve conditions in the enclave. Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land, air and sea borders. The wider Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled for several years."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves after a lunch at the Elysee Palace in Paris on November 11, 2018, during commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the November 11, 1918 armistice, ending World War I. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plotted his next moves on Thursday after his defence minister resigned over the Gaza ceasefire, throwing his coalition into crisis and raising the possibility of early elections. After Avigdor Lieberman announced his resignation on Wednesday, Netanyahu was clinging to a one-seat majority in parliament. The far-right party of Education Minister Naftali Bennett, one of Netanyahu's main rivals, demanded on Wednesday he be given the defence portfolio or its eight seats would be withdrawn from the coalition. In a speech on Thursday, Bennett did not reiterate the threat, but made his case for why he should be defence minister. ""The most dangerous thing for the state of Israel is that we begin to think that there is no solution to terrorism, to terrorists, to missiles,"" said Bennett, who heads the Jewish Home party. ""There is a solution. When Israel wants to win, we will win."" Leader of the far-right Jewish Home party seems to float a Trump-esque election slogan ""Make Israel Win Again."" Bennet opposed Netanyahu's decision not to launch a war in Gaza. https://t.co/KVJDiVBcNe Stable government Netanyahu and Bennett were reportedly set to meet on Friday, but there were increasing signs the coalition's days may be numbered. Another key coalition partner, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon of centre-right Kulanu, reportedly told Netanyahu elections should be called because a stable government was needed to keep the economy on track. Netanyahu was seeking to contain the political fallout of his decision to accept a ceasefire deal on Tuesday that ended the worst escalation between Israel and blockaded Gaza since a 2014 war. Lieberman said it was ""capitulating to terror"" when announcing his resignation and also criticised Netanyahu's recent decision to allow Qatar to send millions of dollars in aid to the blockaded Palestinian enclave. Beyond that, there have been protests calling for tough action against Hamas – which governs Gaza – by Israelis living near the Israel-Gaza fence whose communities were targeted by barrages of rockets from Gaza this week following a botched Israeli attack inside the Palestinian enclave. A poll published on Thursday found 74 percent of respondents were unhappy with Netanyahu's handling of the escalation with Gaza and Hamas, though it also showed his party would still win the most seats. Giving further ammunition to Netanyahu's political critics, Hamas has portrayed the ceasefire and Lieberman's resignation as a victory.

A Likud spokesman said Netanyahu was continuing consultations on Thursday aimed at stabilising his coalition. Netanyahu did not publicly comment on the coalition crisis, but said in reference to Gaza that ""we are in the middle of a campaign. ""Patience, cool and determination are necessary,"" he said. ""We are preparing for what comes next."" Finance Minister Kahlon now in message to Netanyahu ""for the good of Israeli economy, early election best"".

Corruption charges There has long been speculation that Netanyahu may call elections before they are due in November 2019, particularly with police having recommended charges against him in two corruption probes. The attorney general is expected to announce in the coming months whether to pursue charges against him, and some analysts believe he would be better positioned to combat them with a fresh electoral mandate. But Netanyahu would want to make the move at the most advantageous time and likely not with public attention focused on the Gaza ceasefire. The Gaza violence had erupted on Sunday with a botched Israeli special forces operation inside the territory that turned deadly and prompted Hamas retaliation. The blown operation killed seven Palestinians, including a local Hamas military commander, as well as an Israeli army officer."

Earlier Netanyahu met with key coalition partner Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home Party, who had sought the post for himself, but the two men emerged without an agreement. Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government was rocked by Avigdor Lieberman's resignation on Wednesday in protest of a ceasefire reached between Israel and Gaza. Lieberman's far-right Yisrael Beitenu party has quit the coalition and its five MPs have withdrawn support for the government.

Ali Mustafa speaks with Seth Frantzman of The Jerusalem Post for more insights. 'Elections as soon as possible' The premier then spoke by phone with the rest of his coalition partners, urging them to ""make every effort not to bring down the right-wing government"" and to prevent the left from getting into power, the spokesman said. A source close to Bennett said that after his meeting with Netanyahu ""it became clear ... there was a need to go to elections as soon as possible with no possibility of continuing the current government."" Israeli media reported that other coalition partners would oppose Bennett, who leads an ultra-nationalist, religious party, becoming defence minister. An election date would be decided on Sunday, the source close to Bennett said. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who heads the centrist Kulanu party, has also called for a vote to be held before the scheduled date next November. Before the crisis Netanyahu's coaltion had 66 seats in the 120-seat parliament. The loss of Lieberman's five has brought him down to a perilous 61. Losing Bennett's eight means Netanyahu would lose his majority. Opinion polls show that Netanyahu's Likud would be likely to remain the dominant party after a parliamentary election. Netanyahu, a conservative serving his fourth term as premier, is under investigation for corruption.  Commentators say he may agree to bring the ballot forward in order to win a renewed mandate before the attorney-general decides whether to indict him.  Gaza ceasefire The Gaza ceasefire, which ended the worst flare-up between Israel and Gaza since a 2014 war, faced its first major test on Friday, the day of the week when Palestinian protests near the Gaza-Israel fence have typically peaked.  Thousands of demonstrators turned out at Gaza's fence with Israel, an AFP reporter said. Gaza's health ministry said that 14 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli army fire, two of them seriously.  The ceasefire announced on Tuesday has drawn heavy criticism in Israeli communities near the fence that faced rockets from Gaza earlier this week in retaliation to Israeli botched raid.  Hundreds of people joined a demonstration in Tel Aviv on Thursday despite a promise from Netanyahu of more public money for emergency services. They called for tougher action against Gaza. 'Speeding train' Pro-Netanyahu freesheet Yisrael Hayom daily predicted that the prime minister would do all he could to avoid a general election while his hard-won security credentials were at issue. ""Holding elections with the fiasco in Gaza in the background cracks the image of the ultimate leader that he has built over the course of years,"" it said.  ""The chances of stopping this speeding train appear impossible, but Netanyahu is still trying.""  The eight lawmakers of Bennett's far-right Jewish Home party are not the only threat to Netanyahu's razor-thin parliamentary majority. Kahlon, whose centre-right Kulanu party holds 10 seats, has reportedly told Netanyahu that a snap election is necessary. But Yisrael Hayom said Bennett was key to efforts to avoid an early election and could yet prove Netanyahu's political salvation. ""Naftali Bennett as defence minister and Netanyahu as prime minister could together project stability and embark on a coordinated offensive against anyone who gets in the way,"" it said. In a speech on Thursday, Bennett did not reiterate the resignation threat but made his case for why he should get the defence post. ""The most dangerous thing for the state of Israel is that we begin to think that there is no solution to terrorism, to terrorists, to missiles,"" he said. ""There is a solution. When Israel wants to win, we will win."" Graft troubles Netanyahu – flanked by Kahlon, Interior Minister Arie Deri and army top brass – met with the leaders of Israeli border communities Thursday and discussed a $139 million two-year package to improve emergency medical and social services, a government statement said. With a major domestic political battle on his hands, Netanyahu cancelled a planned two-day visit to Austria next week for a conference on anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. There has long been speculation that Netanyahu would call a general election before its scheduled date of November 2019. Police have recommended he be charged in two separate corruption cases and the attorney general is expected to announce in the coming months whether to put him on trial. Analysts say the prime minister would be better positioned to fight any charges with a fresh mandate from the voters. But he would not have chosen to go the polls with voters' attention focused on the Gaza ceasefire and his rivals' efforts to outbid his security credentials."

Protesters walk toward the fence of Gaza Strip border with Israel during a protest east of Gaza City on  November 16, 2018. Gaza's Hamas rulers are sticking to a cease-fire with Israel by keeping border protests widely restrained. Thousands of Palestinians participated Friday in a Hamas-organised rally along the perimeter fence dividing Gaza from Israel, with crowds staying at least 300 metres from the fence.  However, Gaza's health ministry said 40 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli fire and tear gas, without giving a number breakdown. Witnesses said most of the injuries occurred in stone-throwing incidents at the usual five protest locations. No tire burnings or attempts to breach the fence were reported.  Such acts have often triggered lethal Israeli army fire. Since the near-weekly protests began in March, more than 170 Palestinians have been killed. Earlier this week, Hamas and Israel fought a cross-border battle of rocket attacks and airstrikes, triggered by a botched Israeli undercover raid in Gaza on November 11. An Egyptian-brokered cease-fire ended the two-day flare-up. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government has been rocked by Avigdor Lieberman's resignation on Wednesday in protest at the ceasefire.  TRT World's Iolo ap dafydd reports from Gaza.  Hamas leaders promise retaliation Hamas supporters on Friday held a memorial rally for Nour el Deen Baraka, the Hamas commander killed by Israeli special forces last week. Baraka was a mid-level commander for the group in charge of an area in the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis, where the rally was held. Yehiyeh Sinwar, Hamas leader in Gaza, told the crowd that Abu Obaida, Hamas' armed wing spokesman, had said the group will respond to any bombardment by Israel by expanding the range of its rocket fire. An Egyptian mediation team to Gaza, headed by Ahmad Abdul-Kahliq, also attended the rally."

Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked deliver statements to members of the media, at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem November 19, 2018. A key Israeli minister said on Monday he will not quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition for now despite sharp disagreements, potentially ending a crisis that has threatened to topple the government and provoke snap polls. The announcement by Education Minister Naftali Bennett was a dramatic climbdown from his Jewish Home party's earlier threat to leave Netanyahu's coalition if he was not named defence minister. Netanyahu has refused to give the post to Bennett, one of his main political rivals, despite the coalition crisis. Bennett, whose far-right party holds eight seats in parliament, said he would give Netanyahu time to correct course on a range of issues. ""If the prime minister is serious in his intentions, and I want to believe his words from last night, I am saying here to the prime minister we are removing at this moment all of our political demands and will help you in the huge mission of making Israel win again,"" Bennett said in a statement to journalists broadcast live on television. He acknowledged the backlash he may face for backing down from the earlier ultimatum. ""I know I'll pay a political price – not the end of the world, you win some, you lose some,"" Bennett said. ""It's better that the prime minister beats me in a political battle than (Hamas leader Ismail) Haniya beats Israel."" Netanyahu on defence minister portfolio Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said on Sunday he would take on the defence minister portfolio, rejecting calls to dissolve his government. Netanyahu said heading to elections now, amid repeated violent confrontations with Gaza militants, was ""irresponsible"" of his coalition partners, who have been pushing for early polls since the resignation last week of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman over a Gaza ceasefire. ""Today, I take on for the first time the position of defence minister,"" said Netanyahu, speaking from Israel's defence headquarters in Tel Aviv in a statement broadcast live at the top of the evening newscasts. ""We are in one of the most complex security situations and during a period like this, you don't topple a government. During a period like this you don't go to elections,"" he said. The sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of the hawkish Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. The latest exchange of rocket and missile fire was triggered by a deadly Israeli incursion into Hamas-governed Gazan territory. Lieberman alleged the ceasefire agreement reached with Gaza's Hamas rulers will put southern Israel under a growing threat from the group, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon's heavily armed Hezbollah group. Netanyahu spoke Sunday night after a crucial meeting with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon on resolving the coalition crisis. Kahlon's office said earlier that his meeting with Netanyahu ended without a conclusion and they would meet again later in the week. Netanyahu said earlier on Sunday he would try to convince Kahlon and his centrist Kulanu party to stay in the fold in a ""last effort"" to prevent the collapse of his government, which has been rocked by the resignation of its defence minister over a ceasefire agreement with Gaza militants. ""It would be both unnecessary and incorrect to go to elections. We remember well what happened when elements inside the coalitions took down Likud governments in 1992 and in 1999,"" he said, noting the past two elections in which the Labor Party came to power. ""We need to do everything we can to prevent repeating these mistakes,"" he added. Tottering coalition The departure of Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament.  Netanyahu's other partners say that makes governing untenable and would leave the coalition susceptible to the extortion of any single lawmaker until elections scheduled for November 2019. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, already threatened to bring down the government if he is not appointed defence minister. Bennett, a key coalition partner and one of Netanyahu's main right-wing rivals, announced he would give his own statement on Monday morning. Netanyahu is trying to convince his coalition partners to stay, and his Likud allies are already preparing to pin the blame on them if that effort fails. ""I think that there is no reason to shorten the term of a national government, not even for one day, and at this moment it's in the hands of the education minister and the finance minister,"" said Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security. No Israeli government has served out its full term since 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximise his chances of re-election. Netanyahu under fire Though Netanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself in recent months, the current timing is not ideal for him. He has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the Gaza ceasefire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party.  But with Lieberman forcing his hand and the other coalition partners appearing eager to head to the polls he may not have a choice. Most opinion polls show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would secure him a place in Israeli history as the country's longest-serving leader.  But several factors could trip him up, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention. Police have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has long been eagerly awaiting the attorney general's decision on whether to press charges. Netanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterising them as part of a media-driven witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office."

This Oct. 22, 2016 photo, shows a general view of housing in the Israeli settlement of Revava, near the West Bank city of Nablus. Home-renting company Airbnb Inc said on Monday it would remove listings of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move Tel Aviv called a ""wretched capitulation"" to boycotters and Palestinians hailed as a step towards peace. The decision, affecting some 200 listings, would take effect in the coming days, Airbnb said. Israel occupied the West Bank in a 1967 war. Its settlements on the occupied territory are considered illegal by the United Nations as well as most of its member countries. Palestinians deem the settlements, and the military presence needed to protect them, to be obstacles to their goal of establishing a state. Israel disputes this. ""We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians,"" Airbnb said on its website. ""Our hope is that someday sooner rather than later, a framework is put in place where the entire global community is aligned so there will be a resolution to this historic conflict and a clear path forward for everybody to follow."" Palestinians and their supporters had long lobbied Airbnb to delist the settlements. Israel strongly opposes such calls for boycotts. Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called Airbnb's move ""the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts."" Speaking on Israel's Channel 13 television, he said Israel was not told of the decision in advance and that it would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in US courts. Waleed Assraf, head of a Palestinian anti-settlement group run by the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation, welcomed Airbnb's decision. Should other companies follow suit, he told Reuters, ""this will contribute to achieving peace."" Oded Revivi, mayor of the occupied West Bank settlement of Efrat and a representative of the umbrella settler council Yesha, said Airbnb's decision was contrary to the company's stated mission of helping ""to bring people together in as many places as possible around the world."" 65-page report Human Rights Watch said the Airbnb move came on the eve of its publication of a 65-page report it has carried out into tourist rental listings in settlements, including by Airbnb. “Airbnb’s decision to end its listings in Israeli settlements is an important recognition that such listings can’t square with its human rights responsibilities,"" the group said on Monday. ""We urge other companies to follow suit.”  The group said its report would be released on Tuesday morning. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. Israel considers the West Bank as a security bulwark to the east. Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. US-sponsored peace talks have been stalled since 2014. San Francisco-based Airbnb is eyeing an IPO next year after announcing in February it would not make a public debut this year."

General view shows houses in Shvut Rachel, a West Bank illegal Jewish settlement located close to the  illegal Jewish settlement of Shilo, near Ramallah, October 6, 2016. The Knesset – Israel's Parliament – has approved the second and third readings of legislation that will allow the further expansion of an illegal Jewish-only settlement in occupied East Jerusalem's Silwan neighbourhood, located south of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound.   Both readings were approved late Monday by a vote of 63 to 41.   The law allows new settlement units to be erected inside an area recently designated as a ""national park."" The initiative is being spearheaded by pro-settler group Elad, which is known for promoting the confiscation of Palestinian property in occupied East Jerusalem to make way for the construction of illegal Jewish settlements.   Seizure of Palestinian lands Palestinians accuse the Israeli authorities of seizing Palestinian land in and around Jerusalem on the pretext of establishing ""national parks"" before transferring it to the ownership of settler groups.   Jerusalem remains at the heart of the decades-long Mideast conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, might one day serve as the capital of a Palestinian state.   International law continues to view occupied East Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank, as ""occupied territories"" and considers all Jewish settlement construction there as illegal.   Trump's Jerusalem move Early last month, US President Donald Trump drew condemnation from across the Arab and Muslim world when he announced his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. During the protests against Trump's decision, dozens of Palestinian civilians, including children and women, were killed by the Israeli forces."
