CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/snack-money-pet-cafes-trend-china-intl-hnk/index.html,Pets in China are earning ‘snack money’ in cafes as their owners send them to work,Chinese pet owners are sending their furry friends to work in cafes amid an explosion of venues in China offering animal encounters alongside food and drink.,"Oct 15, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,CNN,China,"
            Jane Xue sent her dog, a 2-year-old Samoyed named OK, off to her first day of work in mid-September. Her employer? A dog cafe in Fuzhou, in southeastern China.
     
            “I feel it’s just like parents sending their kids off to school,” the 27-year-old PhD student told CNN as she dropped OK off for her new part-time job.
     
            Xue wanted her dog to “experience a different life,” as she and her partner are usually out on weekends.
     
            “Sending OK to the cafe is a win-win. She gets to play with other dogs and won’t feel so lonely,” she said.
     
            Pet cafes are a big business in China. Visitors get to interact with the animals that roam the shop, allowing the venue owners to charge more for the experience. Customers visiting China’s cat and dog cafés usually pay an entrance fee, ranging from 30-60 yuan ($4-8.5) per person, or simply need to order something like a cup of coffee.
     
            In addition to being surrounded by playmates, Xue says OK’s job in the cafe allows her and her partner to save money. If they leave her at home, they have to run the air-conditioning all day, which gets pricey.
     
            “Summers in Fuzhou can be brutal,” she added.
     
            Xue’s idea might sound unconventional, but it’s a growing trend in China. Called “Zhengmaotiaoqian” in Chinese, it translates to “earn snack money.”
     
            The phrase stems from the idea that these pets are actually working – either part-time or full-time – at cat and dog cafes and then returning home to their families at night, just like  humans.
     
            Though the snack money trend may seem cute and fun, it’s a sign of the times, too. China is expected to have more pets than toddlers by the end of this year, according to Goldman Sachs.
     
            In recent months, cafe owners and pet owners alike have been posting recruitment ads and CVs on Xiaohongshu, China’s answer to Instagram.
     
            In one viral post titled “What is the salary for working in a cat cafe?” a cat café owner wrote: “Many people say they want to send their cats to work in our cat café, if that is the case, let me introduce the salary of our café, as we just paid some of our old employees!”
     
            According to the tongue-in-cheek post, which has garnered hundreds of likes, a gray and white cat named Datou (“big head”) ended up getting five cans of cat food “after taxes.”
     
            “Cat employees wanted!” wrote another cafe shop owner in a post on Xiaohongshu that got more than 100 likes and 600 comments.
     
            “We’re looking for healthy, good-tempered cats,” the owner added. “We offer a snack per day, and a 30% discount for pet owner’s friends!”
     
            CNN reached out to some of the cafe owners for comment.
     
            As for Xue, she says she stumbled upon some dog cafe posts on Xiaohongshu and thought it would be fun to send OK to work. She soon found one in Fuzhou called “Yezonghui” and messaged the owner. Next, it was time to groom OK in preparation for her job interview.
     
            “The cafe owner watched OK for about an hour to see if she interacted well with customers and got along with the other four dogs,” Xue told CNN.
     
            The screening process clearly went well – the pretty white Samoyed was offered the “job.”
     
            “My OK is the star of the cafe!” she said.
     
            Some are not as lucky as OK when it comes to the job hunt.
     
            Xin Xin, a 33-year-old Chinese teacher at an international elementary school in Beijing, has two cats (one black-and-white and one orange), as well as a Shiba Inu dog.
     
            She’s been on the lookout for a job for her 2-year-old tuxedo cat, Zhang Bu’er, which  means “not stupid” in Chinese.
     
            Xin posted her cat’s CV on Xiaohongshu on September 8, hoping to find him employment at a cat cafe, but hasn’t had any luck yet.
     
            “He is clingy and good at purring! A cat chosen by God to work at a cat cafe!” Xin wrote on Zhang Bu’er’s resume, noting that they “only expect some cans of cat food or snacks as his salary.”
     
            “I thought (cat cafe) owners would reach out to me – now it looks like I need to take the initiative and send the (cat’s) resume out,” she lamented to CNN.
     
            Xin says Zhang Bu’er spends her days sleeping and “parkours” at night, making a racket and disturbing her and her husband’s sleep.
     
            More annoyingly for Xin, Zhang Bu’er would always curl up on her laptop when she was working overtime.
     
            “He just lounged around, watching me hustle away like a workhorse,” she said, jokingly.
     
            “(My husband and I) want him to be a working cat, to get a taste of the grind and earn his own food.”
     
            Xin said she spends about 500 yuan ($71) per month feeding her two cats.
     
            “I think (Zhang Bu’er) gets too bored during the day,” she said. “A job would help him burn off some energy.”
     
            China’s first cat cafe opened in the southern city of Guangzhou in 2011 and the number of similar establishments has grown by 200% per year in the country, according to CBNData, China’s state-linked financial paper.
     
            As of 2023, there were more than 4,000 cat cafe-related companies in the country.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/china/china-pandas-coming-to-washington-intl-hnk/index.html,"They’re cute, cuddly and coming to America: China’s newest panda diplomats headed for Washington","Two giant pandas are on their way from China to Washington’s National Zoo, kicking off a much-awaited return of the beloved bears to the American capital.","Oct 15, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
            Two giant pandas are on their way from China to Washington’s National Zoo, kicking off a much-awaited return of the beloved bears to the American capital.
     
            Bao Li and Qing Bao, both three years old, left the giant panda research base in Dujiangyan, a city near the bears’ native habitat in the mountains of southwest China, on Monday night local time. They boarded a specially chartered FedEx Boeing 777 cargo jet dubbed the “Panda Express” early Tuesday morning local time and took off for Washington.
     
            “We have prepared corn buns, bamboo shoots, carrots, water, and medicine to ensure the pandas’ needs are met during the flight,” the China Wildlife Conservation Association said in a statement announcing the pair’s departure.
     
            The black and white duo are the first pandas China has sent to Washington in 24 years. The previous pair returned to China with their cub last November, triggering a flood of tearful goodbyes at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo.
     
            Over the past 11 months, the zoo’s panda exhibit, which used to draw millions of visitors, has been left empty. Now, having just completed a million-dollar revamp, it’s counting down the hours to welcome the new tenants.
     
            China’s renewed panda diplomacy with the US is a rare bright spot in the fraught relations between the world’s two superpower rivals – which have been marred by tensions over trade, technology, geopolitics and more.
     
            Before their departure from the Dujiangyan base, the pandas were brought out in large transport crates and loaded onto two waiting trucks. CNN was the sole foreign media present to witness their departure.
     
            The male, Bao Li, appeared calm and composed as he slowly paced around the crate. Qing Bao, a petite female, was more restless. She stood up and stuck her snout and paws out through the bars as her crate was forklifted onto the truck.
     
            Staff members waved photos of the two bears and banners as the trucks drove by, chanting slogans wishing them a safe journey.
     
            A sendoff ceremony was held earlier on Monday at a hotel near the base, joined by a delegation from the Washington zoo who came to the Chinese province of Sichuan to help with the transition.
     
            Speaking at the ceremony, the zoo’s director, Brandie Smith, hailed half a century of collaboration between the Smithsonian and its Chinese partners on panda conservation, since the first pair arrived from China in 1972.
     
            “These beloved black and white bears are icons in Washington DC, and adored around the world,” Smith said. “Our team and legions of fans look forward to welcoming Bao Li and Qing Bao to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo.”
     
            The two pandas are loaned to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo for 10 years, with an annual fee of $1 million to support conservation efforts back in China.
     
            While born in Sichuan, Bao Li has deep familial roots in Washington. His mother, Bao Bao, was born a celebrity at the National Zoo in 2013 and returned to China four years later. His grandparents, Meixiang and Tian Tian, lived at the zoo for 23 years until their lease ended last year.
     
            “He reminds me a lot of his grandfather, Tian Tian,” said Mariel Lally, a panda keeper from the National Zoo who is accompanying Bao Li and Qing Bao on the flight to Washington.
     
            “Bao Li looks almost identical to him, so it’s almost like having Tian Tian Junior,” she told CNN in Dujiangyan the day before the bears’ departure.
     
            Much preparation has been made for the two pandas’ journey across the Pacific Ocean.
     
            Lally spent the past 10 days at the Dujiangyan base getting to know the two pandas and working with their Chinese keepers for the transfer. Two more colleagues – a vet and another keeper – arrived from Washington last week to join the training.
     
            Bao Li and Qing Bao were taken off public display and placed in quarantine on September 13 – a day after Qing Bao turned three years old. (Bao Li had his birthday five weeks earlier.) They were kept in separate enclosures in a fenced-off quarantine zone lined with bamboo trees, tucked in a quiet staff-only area away from the crowds of tourists.
     
            Ren Zhijun, a Chinese keeper who has been caring for the two bears in quarantine, said he was struck by the pair’s completely different personalities.
     
            Bao Li is energetic and has a great appetite – living up to his name, which means “precious vigor.” The female, Qing Bao, which means “green treasure,” is “lazy and loves to sleep,” Ren said. “When she wants to have some exercises, she would climb a tree.”
     
            Ren also noticed a big difference in their appetite: Bao Li, who loves bamboo shoots, can eat twice as much bamboo as Qing Bao, who counts carrots and apples as her favorite food.
     
            Having cared for the bears for weeks, it would be hard to say goodbye, Ren told CNN on Sunday. “The pandas are like my own children,” he said.
     
            Bao Li and Qing Bao spent their last few days in Dujiangyan getting trained for their first long-haul flight. Every morning, the pair would walk into their shipping crates voluntarily as soon as the door opened – with a little help of food.
     
            “They go in there, they get their favorite treats, and it’s actually difficult to get them out of it,” Lally said. “They’re really comfortable in there, and the crates are humongous. They could lay down in either direction, stand up, do a cartwheel – you name it, there’s so much space.”
     
            The crates are built in a way that allows the keepers to pass bamboo, bamboo shoots, fruits and fresh water to the bears on the flight.
     
            “(They) will have a very comfortable ride even though it’s gonna be a long ride,” Lally said.
     
            The Smithsonian’s National Zoo was the first in the US to exhibit the rare, cuddly animals as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” – a strategic tool to win partners, build goodwill and showcase soft power.
     
            It all began with US President Richard Nixon’s ice-breaking trip to Communist China during the Cold War. During that historic visit in 1972, first lady Pat Nixon was reportedly charmed by the pandas at the Beijing Zoo.
     
            Days later, when seated next to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at a banquet in Beijing, Pat Nixon noticed a box of cigarettes on the table decorated with pandas. “Aren’t they cute? I love them,” she told his host. “I’ll give you some,” he replied.
     
            Weeks later, a pair of pandas, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, arrived at the National Zoo in Washington. “I think pandamonium is going to break out right here at the zoo,” Pat Nixon quipped at the welcome ceremony.
     
            She was right. On their first day of public display, the two pandas drew a reported 20,000 visitors. Since then, giant pandas have become the zoo’s star attraction, drawing millions of visitors.
     
            The zoo’s 24-hour Giant Panda Cam has garnered more than 100 million page views since its launch in 2000. It went offline last November, when Mei Xiang, Tiantian and their youngest cub Xiao Qi Ji left for China.
     
            For many DC residents, their departure signaled the end of an era: for the first time in 23 years, the giant panda exhibit at the National Zoo had become empty.
     
            It also stoked fears that the US might soon be without pandas. San Diego and Memphis had already returned their bears to China in recent years, and the only four remaining in Atlanta departed last weekend.
     
            While the flurry of departures was somewhat expected as the zoos’ panda leases expired, it came at a fraught moment in relations between the US and China. Some observers wondered whether Beijing was halting “panda diplomacy” with America and instead doling out new panda loans to Europe and the Middle East.
     
            Then, in a visit aimed at stabilizing rocky ties, Chinese leader Xi Jinping signaled in San Francisco in last November that China would be sending new panadas to the US, calling them “envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.”
     
            A new round of “panda diplomacy” soon resumed. In June, a pair of pandas arrived at the San Diego Zoo, weeks after the National Zoo announced it would be getting two new bears by the end of the year.
     
            Smith, the National Zoo’s director, called the upcoming arrival of Bao Li and Qing Bao a “historic moment” opening the next chapter of the zoo’s giant panda conservation program.
     
            “Giant pandas truly represent how great conservation outcomes can be achieved through great partnerships and with public support,” she said.
     
            But not everyone in China is happy about these new loans. A fringe but vocal group of online influencers have vehemently protested sending China’s “national treasures” to the US and other countries.
     
            Some voiced concerns about their wellbeing, alleging without evidence that American zoos have mistreated pandas. Such claims, often fueled by nationalistic, anti-US sentiment, gained traction on Chinese social media in recent years following the controversy over the health of Ya Ya, a panda formerly at the Memphis Zoo.
     
            When Bao Li and Qing Bao were taken into quarantine in September, the China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda issued a statement rebuffing rumor about the mistreatment of pandas at the Washington zoo.
     
            “The international cooperation on giant pandas holds great significance,” the center said, adding that it had clarified such rumors multiple times. “We fully understand everyone’s concern for the two giant pandas, but please do not believe internet rumors.”
     
  Correction: This article has been updated to show that the Atlanta bears returned to China last weekend.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/china/kanye-west-china-censorship-intl-hnk/index.html,China’s censorship is among the toughest in the world. So why did it let Kanye West play?,Ye is among a growing number of Western artists returning to the world’s second-biggest economy which is struggling to revive an economy plagued by a property crisis and weak frugal consumer spending.,"Oct 13, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Chris Lau,China,"
            It seemed like an unlikely stage for Kanye West to unveil his new music.
     
            But last month the American rapper – now known as Ye – held not just one but two sold-out “listening parties” in China, a country that imposes some of the toughest censorship in the world.
     
            Playing on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, his first concerts in the country in 16 years, Ye astounded fans by announcing his new album “Bully” and left some wondering why the country’s ruling Communist Party would allow such a controversial artist to perform.
     
            Just six years ago, Chinese authorities clamped down on hip-hop, blacklisting songs and dropping rappers from shows. Its media regulator banned Chinese television from featuring “actors with tattoos (or depict) hip-hop culture, subculture and immoral culture.” One Chinese rapper, PG One, even apologized for lyrics that came under fire for glorifying drugs and sex.
     
            As well as his own frequent lyrical references to sex and drugs, along with cutting social and political commentary, Ye has made a number of controversial statements in his personal life. He wore a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt in public, and an antisemitic outburst he made lost him an extremely lucrative sneakers deal with German brand Adidas.
     
            Yet, he managed to stage his “Vulture Listening Experience” at the Wuyuan River Sports Stadium in Hainan’s provincial capital Haikou, an arena with more than 41,000 seats, on September 15 and September 28.
     
            He is among a growing number of Western artists returning to the world’s second-biggest economy since the lifting of Covid restrictions.
     
            The Chinese Communist Party, which views popular culture as a key ideological battleground, has long kept the entertainment sector on a tight leash with stringent censorship. But it has also encouraged its growth, especially its domestic industries like film and music, often using them to instill patriotism.
     
            Under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the party has grown ever more focused on ideological and cultural control. The dazzle of stardom and the frenzy of fandom are increasingly viewed as a dangerous, pernicious influence – especially on the country’s youth.
     
            In 2021, the party cracked down on China’s entertainment industry and what it called “toxic” celebrity culture, accusing it of “advocating wrong values” to Chinese youth.
     
            Experts say Ye’s shows could mark a turning point. Allowing him to play shows in China “sends a signal that Western artists are welcome to play in China if they comply with local restrictions,” said Chen Dan, an associate professor at the University of Richmond’s political science department.
     
            Several other American megastars have also recently set their eyes on performing in China.
     
            Mariah Carey performed two shows in Beijing in September, sharing photos on X of her visiting the Great Wall of China with her children. John Legend also played gigs in Beijing and Shanghai in October.
     
            American singer Charlie Puth is also set to perform in China in early December.
     
            Letting in these Western stars could be a way for Beijing to boost consumer spending, Chen says, as it tries to revive a flailing economy plagued by high youth unemployment, a protracted property crisis and lukewarm consumer confidence.
     
            In recent weeks, the country has unveiled a raft of stimulus measures, including freeing commercial banks to lend more money and making borrowing cheaper. The government also announced rare cash handouts to disadvantaged citizens while pledging subsidies for recent graduates struggling to find a job.
     
            “The primary motivation for approving Kanye West’s performance may be commercial, that is, to revive the cultural and tourism industry,” Chen said. “China needs commercial revival and more cultural exchange.”
     
            Chinese state media has boasted about the economic benefits Ye’s concerts brought to the tropical island, praising the rapper for “not only firing up his fans, but also sparking a surge in the local holiday tourism economy.”
     
            Almost all fans at his first performance came from outside the province, with the highest ticket sales recorded in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, according to state-run China Daily.
     
            Ye’s first show coincided with the first day of the Mid-Autumn festival holiday, and the average hotel occupancy rate in Haikou jumped by about a half to 83%, year on year, on the same holiday a year earlier. Travelers generated an estimated 373 million yuan ($52.6 million) in tourism revenue for the port city, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
     
            China’s growing music market also represents a massive opportunity for artists and labels looking to expand their audiences and generate revenue, and for domestic companies looking to capitalize off the growth.
     
            One of the fastest-growing in the world, China’s music market became the fifth-largest market globally in 2022, according to IFPI, a trade body for the recorded music industry. China’s recorded music revenues grew 28.4% in 2022 from the year prior, compared with the global market rise of 9%, IFPI said.
     
            But the embracing of foreign acts also poses a conundrum for Beijing.
     
            “Local governments always want more concerts and activities to boost [the] local economy, while the higher authorities allegedly require more and more vetting of lyrics and contents,” said Hung Ho-fung, sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University.
     
            But while there is a strong financial incentive to crack China’s market, the country’s tough censorship and stringent oversight of performances, including the unpredictability of having shows canceled at the last minute, have presented challenges for artists in the past.
     
            In 2015, two fairly uncontroversial American rock bands – Bon Jovi and Maroon 5 – both had planned shows in Beijing and Shanghai abruptly canceled.
     
            Bon Jovi’s management did not address media queries at the time but social media users speculated the decision may have stemmed from the band’s 2009 video for “We Weren’t Born to Follow,” which featured imagery of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in Beijing – a taboo topic for the Chinese government. Others pointed to a 2010 Bon Jovi gig in Tokyo that featured images of the Dalai Lama – a staunch enemy of Beijing – on the stage background.
     
            In the case of Maroon 5, no official reason was given but many speculated that permits had been pulled over a band member wishing the Dalai Lama happy birthday on social media.
     
            Similarly, promoters for Oasis said they were forced to cancel mainland China shows in 2009 after authorities reportedly discovered a member of the British rock band had played at a Tibetan Freedom gig two years earlier. The rest of the band’s Asia tour, including a concert in Hong Kong, went ahead as planned.
     
            Other US musicians such as Justin Bieber, Jay-Z and Lady Gaga have been barred from even entering China.

            Bieber “engaged in a series of bad behaviors, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China,” China’s Ministry of Culture announced in 2015, without going into details.
     
            American rapper Jay-Z’s debut concerts in the country were canceled in 2006 because the Ministry of Culture “decided to protect the city’s hip-hop fans from nasty lyrics about pimps, guns and drugs,” according to state-run newspaper China Daily.
     
            Some analysts and Chinese fans have speculated whether Ye may have gotten a pass to perform in Hainan because of his brief time living in China as a child. The rapper lived in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing for a year while his mother was teaching at Nanjing University, according to China Daily.
     
            “Kanye West’s childhood experience in Nanjing may have made him an artist to welcome in China,” Chen, from the University of Richmond, said.
     
            Ho, from Johns Hopkins, said it’s too early to tell whether Ye and others’ progress in China will inspire more artists to play there.
     
            Logistical challenges like securing visas, obtaining permits and official approval, play a major role in the decision-making process for bands and their management, which are also concerned about the backlash of having to self-censor and staging up a show deprived of spontaneity.
     
            “This tightening scrutiny, on top of the sluggish economy, makes many foreign performers simply decide not to bother and skip China,” he said.
     
            But he added: “If the recent stimulus works, and leads to a genuine and sustained rebound of consumption, Western entertainers’ calculation may change and (they may) become more willing to take the trouble and the risk.”

            China will “significantly increase” government debt issuance to offer subsidies to people with low incomes, support the property market and replenish state banks’ capital as it pushes to revive sputtering economic growth.
     
            Without providing details on the size of the fiscal stimulus being prepared, Finance Minister Lan Foan told a news conference on Saturday there will be more “counter-cyclical measures” this year.
     
            “There is still relatively big room for China to issue debt,” he said.
     
            The world’s second-largest economy faces strong deflationary pressures due to a sharp property market downturn and frail consumer confidence, which have exposed its over-reliance on exports in an increasingly tense global trade environment.
     
            A wide range of economic data in recent months has missed forecasts, raising concerns among economists and investors that the government’s roughly 5% growth target this year was at risk and that a longer-term structural slowdown could be in play.
     
            Data for September, which will be released over the coming week, is expected to show further weakness, but Zheng Shanjie, the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s state planner, said he was “fully confident” that the target will be met.
     
            Fiscal stimulus measures in China have been the subject of intense speculation in global financial markets after a September meeting of the Communist Party’s top leaders, the Politburo, signaled an increased sense of urgency about mounting economic headwinds.
     
            Chinese stocks reached two-year highs, spiking 25% within days since that meeting, before retreating as nerves set in given the absence of further details on the government’s additional spending plans.
     
            Reuters reported last month that China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus.

            Half of that would be used to help local governments tackle their debt problems, while the other half will subsidize purchases of home appliances and other goods as well as finance a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan, or $114, per child to all households with two or more children.
     
            Separately, Bloomberg News reported that China is also considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the economy, primarily by issuing new sovereign bonds.
     
            Additional debt issuance in China is typically subject to formal approval by its rubber-stamp parliament, which is expected to meet in coming weeks.
     
            The central bank announced the most aggressive monetary support measures for the economy since the Covid-19 pandemic in September, including numerous steps to help pull the property sector out of a multi-year slump, including mortgage rate cuts.
     
            However, while the measures have lifted Chinese share prices, many analysts say Beijing also needs to firmly address more deeply-rooted structural issues such as boosting consumption and reducing its reliance on debt-fueled infrastructure investment.
     
            Most of China’s fiscal stimulus still goes into investment, but returns are dwindling and the spending has saddled local governments with $13 trillion in debt.
     
            Lan said Beijing will support local governments to resolve their debt issues, adding that they still have a combined 2.3 trillion yuan ($325.5 billion) to spend in the last three months of this year, including debt quotas and unused funds.
     
            Local governments will be allowed to repurchase unused land from property developers, Lan said.
     
            Low wages, high youth unemployment and a feeble social safety net mean China’s household spending is less than 40% of annual economic output, some 20 percentage points below the global average. Investment, by comparison, is 20 points above.
     
            A private report by recruiting platform Zhaopin showed that the average pay offered by recruiters in China’s 38 major cities fell 2.5% in the third quarter from the second.
     
            Swedish furniture retailer Ikea, whose 39 stores in China have felt the spillovers from the property crisis, urged Beijing on Thursday to deploy further stimulus.

            Four employees of Taiwan’s Foxconn, the world’s largest iPhone assembler, have been detained in China under “quite strange” circumstances, Taiwan’s government said.
     
            Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, in a statement to Reuters on Thursday, said the four employees had been detained in China’s Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province that is home to a major Foxconn plant assembling Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones, on suspicion of the equivalent of “breach of trust.”
     
            “The circumstances of this case are quite strange,” it said.
     
            The case may be connected to corruption and abuse of power by a small number of Chinese security officials, the council added, without giving details.
     
Foxconn declined to comment.
     
            The council said Foxconn had stated the company had “suffered no losses and that the four employees had done nothing to harm the company’s interests.”
     
            “This has seriously damaged the confidence of companies. We call on relevant departments on the other side of the Taiwan Strait to investigate and deal with it as soon as possible,” it said.
     
            Calls to China’s Taiwan Affairs Office seeking comment outside of office hours went unanswered.

            Global investors went wild during China’s just-concluded Golden Week holiday by snapping up “everything” related to the country. But that optimism didn’t extend to shoppers and travelers in the world’s second-largest economy itself.
     
            Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a Tuesday research note that tourism revenue per person was 2.1% below the pre-pandemic level during the National Day Golden Week, a seven-day period that ended on Monday. Weak consumption calls attention to a persistent problem with consumer confidence.
     
            “Low tourism spending per head and subdued services prices highlighted still weak domestic demand and continued consumption downgrading,” they said. “It remains to be seen how much more easing especially — on the fiscal front — will be announced in the coming months and to what degree it may help boost domestic demand (mainly consumption), normalize prices and rebuild confidence.”
     
            Things are so dire that some economists are pressing the government to unleash a major stimulus package worth up to 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) to restore bullishness in the world’s second-largest economy, which is struggling with a slew of economic problems including falling prices.
     
            Goldman Sachs added that anecdotal evidence indicates hotel prices and airfares during the holiday were lower than year-ago levels. A year and a half after China reopened its borders following the Covid-19 pandemic, consumer confidence is still struggling to recover.
     
            There were some bright spots. According to official data, cross-border travel rose by about 26% to 13 million trips, compared with last year’s holiday period. International flights grew 42% compared with a low base from 2023, according to Citi.
     
            After a slew of weak economic data over the summer prompted concern that China may miss its 5% target growth rate announced in March, leader Xi Jinping finally decided to go ahead with a much-needed stimulus package, mostly focused on monetary measures, in the last week of September.
     
            Share markets soared following the perceived U-turn in government policy. David Tepper, the billionaire founder of American hedge fund Appaloosa Management, told CNBC in an interview on September 26 that he was buying more of “everything” related to China.

            But experts say much more needs to be done to revive confidence, which stood near a historic low this summer.
     
            On Wednesday stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen saw a sharp reversal of recent gains, while Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled following its best two-week period in nearly two decades. (China-related stocks were in the black on Thursday.)
     
            The falls came after China’s top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, largely held off from announcing a major package of stimulus measures at a Tuesday press conference, which disappointed investors.
     
            Now investors are looking ahead to another highly anticipated press conference scheduled for Saturday with the Ministry of Finance, with investors still holding out hope that more direct stimulus measures will be announced.

They are all followers of Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), China’s answer to Instagram.","Oct 10, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Chris Lau,China,"
            Tucked away in a residential neighborhood in the west of Hong Kong, the Kennedy Town Playground’s basketball courts aren’t particularly noteworthy. Most locals walk past them on their way to somewhere else.
     
            But for many tourists visiting the city from mainland China, the courts are a must-see destination.
     
            They’re not interested in joining a pick-up basketball game. It’s because the courts, perched on the side of a hilly slope, offer great views of the Hong Kong skyline.
     
            Meanwhile, a thousand miles away in Seoul, Mandarin-speaking crowds have been converging on Seongsu-dong, an area known for hip cafes. But instead of sipping lattes, they take pictures of a photogenic wall painted with a red rectangle.
     
            These Chinese travelers aren’t finding out-of-the-way locations by chance. Many of them are followers of Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), China’s answer to Instagram, which has also become their travel bible.
     
            “(Xiaohongshu) is comprehensive and it offers a lot that other platforms aren’t able to match,” Jiao Le, a tourist from Beijing, told CNN during a recent visit to the basketball courts in Hong Kong.
     
            With 1.4 billion citizens, China is a major force to be reckoned with in the travel market. However many existing travel apps and recommendation tools are not comprehensive in Chinese.
     
            Hence Xiaohongshu has been able to corner the market – and change the way people travel in Asia and beyond. The app’s users have transformed seemingly under-the-radar places not often visited by Western tourists into hotspots for Chinese travelers.
     
            As witnessed in Hong Kong and Seoul, photo ops are a huge part of the appeal. The images look great on social media, in effect encouraging others to visit. For instance, in Copenhagen, instead of heading straight to the Little Mermaid statue or the Tivoli Gardens amusement park, Chinese visitors are flocking to Black Square, a public space at the Superkilen Urban Park in the quiet residential neighborhood of Norrebro where bright white magnetic-field-esque lines have been painted on the ground.
     
            Sometimes the locations have deeper meanings. If you happen to pass a seemingly nondescript bench at the southeastern corner of Central Park in New York and wonder why people are posing for photos, it’s because Mandopop star Jay Chou sat on the same bench during a 2019 vacation.
     
            In Japan, Chinese tourists flock to a train intersection in Kamakura, south of Tokyo, because it appears in “Slam Dunk,” a basketball-themed anime worshipped by many Chinese fans.
     
            China’s sluggish economy may be hurting people’s appetite for travel these days. Still, the numbers have been given a boost this month as Chinese tourists headed overseas for their long National Day holiday (known as Golden Week), which began on October 1.
     
            Chinese travelers made 7.6 million trips in and out of the country during the holiday, up 33.2% year-on-year, according to state broadcaster CCTV. And it’s very likely many of them used Xiaohongshu as a trip-planning resource.
     
            The rise of unexpected destinations almost exclusive to Chinese tourists has a lot – if not everything – to do with the platform.
     
            Most of its users are Chinese nationals, posting predominantly in their native language, so  what happens on Xiaohongshu usually stays on Xiaohongshu.
     
            Tourists may discover new exciting spots, but the information reaches few travelers outside of China.

Planning a trip to China can be confusing. Here are the issues tripping up many foreign tourists
 
            The app’s name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the red-covered book made up of quotations from the founding father of Communist China, Mao Zedong, though that’s pretty much where the similarities end.
     
            Headquartered in Shanghai, Xiaohongshu was founded by friends Charlwin Mao and Miranda Qu in 2013 as a way for Chinese netizens to share snippets of their lives.
     
            Since then, it’s become one of China’s most popular platforms with 300 million users, according to Chinese social media research firm Qian Gua. Half of its users reportedly come from urban areas and are below the age of 35.
     
            The genres of content have also diversified, now including everything from daily moments to make-up tips, fashion guides and of course travel recommendations.
     
            “It’s more authentic because it’s recommended by a lot of real users and they give their reviews,” Xia Jiale, from the central Chinese city of Luoyang, told CNN Travel. The 26-year-old relied solely on Xiaohongshu to navigate Hong Kong with his wife during their recent trip to the city.
     
            Some businesses in Europe appear to be capitalizing on the trend, including Lobos, which runs two tapas restaurants in London.
     
            “Lobos is officially on Xiaohongshu!” it wrote in a Chinese-language debut post in August, pledging “local Spanish food for you!”
     
            Joel Placeres, one of the restaurants’ directors, told CNN that the app allows them to “build direct connections with the Chinese community, expand our reach and boost the restaurant’s visibility” amidst an array of post-pandemic challenges.
     
            Xiaohongshu is stuffed with users’ reviews of the restaurant, with some posting photos with the chefs. One person declared: “Will keep going as long as it remains open.”
     
            The dishes that draw the most likes on Xiaohongshu are often more sought after at the restaurant, Placeres said. To respond to the demand, the restaurant has added more of these popular foods to its ordering system, making it easier for staff to take Chinese tourists’ orders, he added.
     
            During the 2024 Summer Olympics, several restaurants in Paris also put out signs at the front door touting how much they are loved on Xiaohongshu – in Chinese – while urging customers to leave a good review for them on the social media platform.
     
            But not everyone is thrilled with the increased attention Xiaohongshu can bring. Back in Hong Kong, a crowd has built up near a cafe just across the road from the now-famous basketball courts.
     
            The vintage decor of the cafe makes it another magnet for tourists on the hunt for photogenic spots, including both Jiao and Xia. But the sidewalk is so narrow that the crowds have become an obstacle for elderly locals passing through. Some tourists spill onto the busy road for better angles in the photos.
     
            “Many housewives have complained about it, and it gives rise to conflicts,” said 55-year-old resident Hung, who passes the spot three times a day. (He declined to give his last name out of fear of retaliation for speaking out against the Hong Kong government’s drive to attract mainland tourists.)
     
            “It’s dangerous because it can cause accidents with cars coming through,” he added.
     
            A neighborhood resident of more than 40 years, Hung said governments should do more to mitigate impacts on local communities when the influx of tourists becomes a nuisance.
     
            He has one recommendation not meant for Xiaohongshu, but rather for the authorities in his neighborhood. “At least put up a (traffic warning) sign.”

            China imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on brandy imports from the European Union on Tuesday, hitting brands from Hennessy to Remy Martin, after the 27-state bloc voted for tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs).
     
            China’s commerce ministry said preliminary findings of an investigation had determined that dumping of brandy from the EU threatens “substantial damage” to its own brandy sector.
     
            France’s trade ministry said the temporary Chinese measures were “incomprehensible” and violated free trade, and that it would work with the European Commission to challenge the move at the World Trade Organization.
     
            In a sign of rising trade tensions, China’s ministry added in another statement that an ongoing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into EU pork products would make “objective and fair” decisions when it concludes.
     
            It also said that it was considering a hike in tariffs on imports of large-engine vehicles, which would hit German producers hardest. German exports of vehicles with engines of 2.5 liters or larger to China reached $1.2 billion last year.
     
            France was seen as the target of Beijing’s brandy probe due to its support of tariffs on China-made EVs. French brandy shipments to China reached $1.7 billion last year and accounted for 99% of the country’s imports of the spirit.
     
            As of October 11, importers of brandy originating in the EU will have to put down security deposits mostly ranging from 34.8% to 39.0% of the import value, the ministry said.
     
            “This announcement clearly shows that China is determined to tax us in response to European decisions on Chinese electric vehicles,” French cognac producers group BNIC said in an email.
     
            French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that China’s brandy probe was “pure retaliation,” while EV tariffs were needed to preserve a level playing field.
     
            Hennessy and Remy Martin were among the brands hardest-hit by the measures, with importers having to pay security deposits of 39.0% and 38.1%, respectively.
     
            The deposits would make it more costly upfront to import brandy from the EU. However, they could be returned if a deal is eventually reached before definitive tariffs are imposed.
     
            Shares in Pernod Ricard were down 4.2% at 4:39 a.m. ET, while Remy Cointreau’s dropped 8.7% and shares in LVMH, owner of Hennessy, fell 4.9%.
     
            Companies that cooperated with China’s investigation were hit with security deposit rates of 34.8%, with that imposed on Martell the lowest at 30.6%.
     
            Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau and LVMH did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
     
            The brandy measures follow a vote by the EU to adopt tariffs on China-made EVs by the end of October.
     
            Earlier this year, China suspended its planned anti-dumping measures on EU brandy, in an apparent goodwill gesture, despite determining that it had been sold in China at below-market prices.
     
            At the time, the commerce ministry said its probe would end before January 5, 2025, but that it could be extended.
     
            China’s commerce ministry previously said it had found that European distillers had been selling brandy in its 1.4 billion-strong consumer market at a dumping margin in the range of 30.6% to 39% and that its domestic industry had been damaged.
     
            In the EU’s decision to impose tariffs on China-made EVs, the bloc set tariff rates on top of the 10% car import duty ranging from 7.8% for Tesla (TSLA) to 35.3% for SAIC and other producers deemed not to have cooperated with its investigation.
     
            The European Commission has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative, even after tariffs are imposed.

China has set aside 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) for investment projects by local governments this year, as it promised to meet its own ambitious economic growth targets.
     
            The news was announced by the country’s top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), at a Tuesday press conference, which disappointed investors who were expecting a much larger package of stimulus measures.
     
            “We are confident in achieving the annual economic and social development goals and tasks, and in maintaining sustained, stable and healthy economic and social development,” Zheng Shanjie, the commission’s chairman, told reporters in Beijing.
     
            China announced a 5% target growth rate in March, but a series of economic data over the summer has been so weak that economists were worried the goal might be missed. The world’s second-largest economy is in poor shape and suffers from a property crisis, weak spending and high youth unemployment, among other woes.
     
            To help local governments struggling with mountains of debt, Beijing will provide 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) from the central government’s budget and an extra 100 billion yuan for investment projects, Zheng said.
     
            Economists have been expecting additional fiscal measures totaling about 2 trillion yuan ($285 billion) to be announced this month, after Chinese leader Xi Jinping finally gave the nod in late September to a much-needed growth plan following months of dismal economic data.

China’s economy is in bad shape. Can its ‘whatever-it-takes’ stimulus effort turn things around?
 
            “The NDRC provided a clear message today that policymakers will continue with a pro-growth stance. Nevertheless, investors were disappointed at the lack of details on new fiscal measures,” Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist for HSBC, told CNN. “Fiscal easing is urgently needed to accelerate growth on a sustainable basis. This is likely to come later this month.”
     
            The measures announced last month have focused largely on monetary policy, which typically refers to decisions made by central banks to influence the cost of borrowing and control inflation. Fiscal measures, on the other hand, can include the use of taxation or other measures to impact public spending more directly.
     
            The lack of a “bazooka” announcement on Tuesday poured cold water on the stock mania in Hong Kong and mainland China. Blue-chip stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen last traded 6% higher, after soaring more than 9% at the market open. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index, which has just had its best two-week period since at least 2005, lost more than 5%.
     
            Many economists believe much more must be done to restore confidence among consumers to spend again.
     
            Jia Kang, formerly the director of a think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Finance, told The Paper, a state-owned newspaper, last week that Beijing should issue as much as 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in long-term government bonds to fund investment in infrastructure and public works. He said the amount was “not unreasonable” because Beijing had rolled out similar stimulus measures in the past.
     
            “We agree with top policy advisors like … Jia Kang that an over 10-trillion level or 10% of GDP could be necessary to turn around the economy, considering China’s own history of stimulus,” economists at Citi wrote in a Friday research note.
     
            On September 24, the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, announced a cut in one of its main interest rates and reduced the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve. Cuts to existing mortgage rates were unveiled and the minimum mortgage downpayment was lowered from 25% to 15% for second-time homebuyers to support the ailing property sector. There were also promises to support the stock market.
     
            Officials kept up the optimism the next day by announcing rare cash handouts to disadvantaged citizens and pledging subsidies for recent graduates struggling to find a job.
     
            And later that week, the ruling Communist Party’s 24-member Politburo – a top decision making body – continued the bullish messaging. In a break with tradition, Xi dedicated the group’s September meeting to economic affairs.
     
            Top officials acknowledged that “new situations and problems” had arisen in the economy and demanded urgent action, vowing to boost fiscal spending, arrest the decline of the property market and improve employment for fresh graduates and migrant workers.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/asia/taiwan-china-motherland-history-hnk-intl/index.html,"‘Impossible’ for Communist China to become our motherland as we’re older, Taiwan’s president argues","It is “absolutely impossible” for the People’s Republic of China to become Taiwan’s motherland because the island’s government is older, Taiwan’s president said ahead of the island’s national day celebrations.","Oct 7, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
            It is “absolutely impossible” for Communist China to become Taiwan’s motherland because the island’s government is older, Taiwan’s president has said in a carefully timed speech that underscores the intense historical rivalry between the two.
     
            Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, has long faced Beijing’s wrath for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty and rejecting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s claims over the island.
     
            Despite having never controlled Taiwan, China’s ruling Communist Party has vowed to “reunify” with the self-governing democracy, by force if necessary. But many people on the island view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of the People’s Republic of China.
     
            On Saturday, in a move likely to further infuriate Beijing, Lai dug into history to make his point, stressing that Taiwan is already a “sovereign and independent country” called the Republic of China (ROC), whose government ruled mainland China for decades before relocating to Taiwan when the CCP came to power.
     
            The ROC was founded in 1912 after a Nationalist revolution overthrew China’s last imperial dynasty, the Qing. At the time, Taiwan was a Japanese colony, ceded by the Qing dynasty after it lost a war to Imperial Japan nearly two decades earlier.
     
            The ROC later took control of Taiwan in 1945, following Japan’s defeat in World War II. Four years later, its Nationalist government then fled to the island after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong’s Communist forces, moving the seat of the ROC from the mainland to Taipei.
     
            In Beijing, the CCP took power and founded the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on October 1, 1949. Since then, the two sides have been ruled by separate governments.
     
            Successive Chinese leaders have vowed to one day take control of Taiwan. But Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in decades, has ramped up rhetoric and aggression against the democratic island – fueling tension across the strait and raising concerns for a military confrontation.
     
            Speaking at a concert ahead of Taiwan’s national day on October 10, Lai noted the two governments’ different political roots, delivering a lesson in comparative history.
     
            “Recently, our neighbor, the People’s Republic of China, just celebrated its 75th birthday on October 1. In a few days, the Republic of China will celebrate its 113th birthday,” Lai said, receiving to a round of applause from crowds in a stadium in Taipei.
     
            “Therefore, in terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People’s Republic of China to become the motherland of the people of the Republic of China. On the contrary, the Republic of China may actually be the motherland of citizens of the People’s Republic of China who are over 75 years old.”
     
            Monday is the last day of China’s week-long national day holiday and the Chinese government has not responded to Lai’s remarks.

Xi vows ‘reunification’ with Taiwan on eve of Communist China’s 75th birthday
 
            But his comments have already drawn criticism from politicians in Taiwan’s largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), which has long accused Lai’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party of needlessly stoking tensions with China.
     
            “President Lai has deliberately mentioned ‘People’s Republic of China’ and his ‘motherland theory’ to incite political confrontation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,” Ling Tao, a city councillor from the KMT, wrote in a post on Facebook.
     
            The KMT are the political successors of the Nationalists who fled to Taiwan, ruled the island under martial law for decades and long harbored ambitions to one day restore the Republic of China on the mainland. They later joined Taiwan’s evolution into a democracy and have made significant ideological transformations, including favoring closer ties with Communist China.
     
            Leaders in both Taipei and Beijing have long used their national day addresses to send a message across the Taiwan Strait.
     
            Last week, on the eve of the PRC’s 75th birthday, Xi reiterated his pledge to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan.
     
            “It’s an irreversible trend, a cause of righteousness and the common aspiration of the people. No one can stop the march of history,” Xi told a state banquet at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
     
            “Taiwan is China’s sacred territory. Blood is thicker than water, and people on both sides of the strait are connected by blood,” he said, vowing to resolutely oppose “Taiwan independence” separatist activities.
     
            Beijing has labeled Lai a “dangerous separatist,” and tensions have ratcheted up over the last five months since Lai’s inauguration in May, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan.
     
            Lai is expected to give his first national day address as Taiwan’s president on Thursday.

            After four miserable years, a soaring stock market has brought relief for Francis Lun, who runs a small 10-person brokerage in Hong Kong.
     
            Since the beginning of 2020, he’s seen the city’s lifeblood, its Hang Seng Index, experience an unprecedented consecutive decline due to economic woes and pandemic restrictions, both in the semi-autonomous region and in mainland China.
     
            But the benchmark’s fortunes were unexpectedly turned around in late September when China’s top leaders announced a raft of measures to support the country’s flailing economy. The index has since rallied more than 18%, its biggest two-week gain in nearly 20 years. The stimulus measures should have come far sooner, says Lun, but better late than never.
     
            “Before (the announcement), we were just counting our fingers every day,” he told CNN in his office in the Causeway Bay neighborhood, referring to the lack of business. “But now, we’re getting calls. Things are picking up.”
     
            Hong Kong and China markets are on a roll. But whether the rally continues and, more importantly, whether benefits from the stimulus measures spread beyond stock investors and into the real economy, which is suffering from a potential deflationary spiral and is at risk of missing its own 5% target growth rate, depends on what hasn’t yet been said.
     
            So far, the measures announced have focused on monetary policy, which typically refers to decisions made by central banks to influence the cost of borrowing and control inflation. Beijing has largely held back on unveiling fiscal measures, which can include the use of taxation or other measures to impact public spending.
     
            “The elephant in the room seems to be a lack of consumer confidence,” economists at Nikko Asset Management wrote in a research note on Thursday. “What is really needed is for the authorities to deploy the proverbial ‘big guns’ to push out more fiscal policies. Such a move could address this crisis of confidence, improve risk appetite and reflate the economy.”
     
            Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said in a social media post last week that this could be China’s “whatever it takes” moment, if its leaders end up doing “a lot more” than what’s already been announced.
     
            That could come as early as Tuesday, when the country’s top economic planning agency, the National Development Reform Commission, holds a press briefing to announce a package of policies to boost the economy.

Communist China is celebrating its 75th birthday and its stock market is soaring. But not everyone is in the party spirit
 
            There’s much debate among economists about exactly what Beijing needs to do. But one thing is clear: After years of delay, the leadership appears to be moving decisively.
     
            That conclusion comes from the optics of how the “rare” joint press conference between the People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, National Financial Regulatory Administration Minister Li Yunze and China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Wu Qing took place on September 24, according to Nikko’s economists.
     
            “In an opaque system where every little action is intensely scrutinized, the first thing we noticed was the manner that the official announcement was made. Gone are the days of trying to decipher tersely worded statements, which left much room for interpretation,” they wrote.
     
            The three financial chiefs directly addressed local and international journalists at the hastily arranged event, which indicated an intention to be transparent about such a major policy shift, they added.
     
            Pan announced a cut in one of its main interest rates and reduced the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve. He also unveiled cuts to existing mortgage rates and lowered the minimum mortgage downpayment from 25% to 15% for second-time homebuyers to support the ailing property sector, which many economists believe is the root cause of China’s numerous economic woes.
     
            “This time is different,” HSBC economists led by Jing Liu said last week in an investor note, which called the press conference unusual. “Everything seems like it’s happening all at once. But it’s still just the beginning.”
     
            The investment bank is expecting Beijing to announce one trillion yuan ($142 billion) worth of fiscal spending on consumer products or large construction projects, which will directly stimulate the economy.
     
            Another one trillion yuan may be set aside for recapitalizing banks or helping indebted local governments to issue bonds. The latter won’t give a direct boost to the economy but could help avoid financial risk, HSBC added.

French tycoon gains $17 billion from China’s economic stimulus push
 
Reuters reported on September 26 that China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284 billion) later this year as part of a fresh package of fiscal stimulus measures.
     
            Money raised from special bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance will be used to increase subsidies to encourage people to buy bigger or newer appliances like washing machines or refrigerators, and also to upgrade large-scale business equipment, it said citing unnamed sources.
     
            Some of the money will also fund a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan ($114) per child to all families for each second child and any younger siblings.
     
            Some economists think the Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping can afford to be much more ambitious with its money.
     
            Jia Kang, formerly the director of a think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Finance, told The Paper, a state-owned newspaper, last week that the recent “amplification” of monetary policy was necessary, and that fiscal policy must keep up.
     
            He said Beijing should issue as much as 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in long-term government bonds, specifically to fund investment in the necessary infrastructure and public works that private companies are unable to finance.
     
            Jia, currently president of the China Academy of New Supply-side Economics, a private think tank, was quoted as saying the potential bond issuance of up to 10 trillion yuan was “not unreasonable” because China had done something similar before.
     
            Back in 2008, the country rolled out a four trillion yuan ($570 billion) fiscal package to minimize the impact of the global financial crisis. Jia said China’s economy had expanded sufficiently since then to support the issuance of Treasury bond financing between four trillion to 10 trillion yuan.
     
            Analysts at Barclays said a 10 trillion-yuan fiscal package spread over two years would have a major effect on the economy, adding one full percentage point to growth, but that the plan was just “speculation” for now.
     
            Any meaningful stimulus measures must tackle the problem of oversupply in the property market, experts said.
     
            “The policy pivot … is serious. It has already led to an encouragingly sharp rally in Chinese stocks that could run further in the short term,” Chi Lo of BNP Paribas Asset Management said last week. “But conviction for a turnaround is still needed to sustain the recovery in the Chinese economy and asset markets.”
     
  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the US dollar conversion for 1 trillion yuan. It is $142 billion.

            A highly skilled group of Chinese government-linked hackers has in the last several months infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms in a likely search for sensitive information bearing on national security, multiple sources briefed on the matter told CNN.
     
            US investigators believe the hackers potentially accessed wiretap warrant requests, two of the sources said, but officials are still working to determine what information the hackers may have obtained. US broadband and internet providers AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are among the targets, the sources said.
     
            US officials are concerned about the potential national security damage done by the hacking, which they only recently discovered. It’s the latest sophisticated hack targeting US federal agencies that investigators have linked to China, and it comes amid tensions between Washington and Beijing over cyber-espionage and other high-stakes national security issues.

FBI says it has disrupted major Chinese hacking operation that threatened US critical infrastructure
 
            As the backbone of internet and phone communications, US telecom firms hold enormous volumes of caller and user data. US law enforcement agencies request access, through a warrant, to specific portions of that data as part of criminal and national security investigations.
     
            Some of those investigations would be of keen interest to Beijing. The US government has in recent years brought charges against Chinese government agents for allegedly harassing Chinese nationals on US soil and for hacking political dissidents and American companies.
     
            AT&T and Lumen declined to comment. Verizon did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
     
            The Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment.
     
            The Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, denied that Beijing-backed hackers had breached US telecom firms, calling that information “a distortion of the fact.” Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu accused the US of “politicizing cybersecurity issues to smear China.”
     
            The Wall Street Journal first reported on the hacking activity.
     
            US officials have briefed the House and Senate intelligence committees on the Chinese hacking campaign, two sources said. Cybersecurity experts from Microsoft and Google-owned firm Mandiant have been helping to investigate the hacking activity.
     
            People probing the hacks have been struck by the hackers’ skill, persistence and ability to burrow into computer networks, the sources briefed on the matter said. The Chinese hacking team in question is known in the cybersecurity industry as Salt Typhoon.
     
            “We track Salt Typhoon and have seen activity consistent with public news reports,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN. “When we see nation state activity, we provide customers with information to investigate as appropriate.”
     
            Yet the Chinese government has an array of other hacking teams at its disposal that can conduct espionage or disrupt computer networks, according to US officials and private experts. FBI Director Christopher Wray has said that Chinese government-backed hackers outnumber FBI cyber personnel 50 to 1.
     
            Another Chinese government-backed hacking group has been lurking in US transportation and communication networks, waiting to use that access to disrupt any US response to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, US officials have alleged.
     
            Yet another Chinese group broke into the unclassified email accounts of senior US diplomats last year on the eve of a high-profile visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China, CNN reported.
     
            Seeking to sway public opinion in the face of detailed US government allegations, China has increasingly accused the US government of conducting cyberattacks against Chinese organizations.
     
            Hacking and information operations are a regular point of contention in bilateral meetings. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 presidential election when the two men met in California last year, CNN previously reported.

Critics say it’s more proof the city is moving closer to China,"Glance up while strolling through parts of downtown Hong Kong and, chances are, you’ll notice the glassy black lens of a surveillance camera trained on the city’s crowded streets.","Oct 6, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Jessie Yeung,China,"
            Glance up while strolling through parts of downtown Hong Kong and, chances are, you’ll notice the glassy black lens of a surveillance camera trained on the city’s crowded streets.
     
            And that sight will become more common in the coming years, as the city’s police pursue an ambitious campaign to install thousands of cameras to elevate their surveillance capabilities.
     
            Though it consistently ranks among the world’s safest big cities, police in the Asian financial hub say the new cameras are needed to fight crime – and have raised the possibility of equipping them with powerful facial recognition and artificial intelligence tools.
     
            That’s sparked alarm among some experts who see it as taking Hong Kong one step closer to the pervasive surveillance systems of mainland China, warning of the technology’s repressive potential.
     
            Hong Kong police had previously set a target of installing 2,000 new surveillance cameras this year, and potentially more than that each subsequent year. The force plans to eventually introduce facial recognition to these cameras, security chief Chris Tang told local media in July – adding that police could use AI in the future to track down suspects.
     
            In a statement to CNN, the Hong Kong Police Force said it was studying how police in other countries use surveillance cameras, including how they use AI. But it’s not clear how many of the new cameras may have facial recognition capabilities, or whether there’s a timeline for when the tech will be introduced.
     
            Tang and the Hong Kong police have repeatedly pointed to other jurisdictions, including Western democracies, that also make wide use of surveillance cameras for law enforcement. For instance, Singapore has 90,000 cameras and the United Kingdom has more than seven million, Tang told local newspaper Sing Tao Daily in June.
     
            While some of those places, like the UK, have started using facial recognition cameras, experts say these early experiments have highlighted the need for careful regulation and privacy protections. Hong Kong police told CNN they would “comply with relevant laws” and follow strong internal guidelines – but haven’t elaborated in depth on what that would look like.
     
            And, some critics say, what sets Hong Kong apart from other places is its political environment – which has seen an ongoing crackdown on political dissent, as it draws closer to authoritarian mainland China.

What Hong Kong’s masked protesters fear
 
            Following unprecedented and often violent anti-government protests that rocked the city in 2019, local and central authorities imposed sweeping national security laws that have been used to jail activists, journalists and political opponents, and target civil society groups and outspoken media outlets.
 
            Hong Kong’s leaders have said the laws are needed to restore stability after the protests in the nominally semi-autonomous city, and argue their legislation is similar to other national security laws around the world.
     
            “The difference is how the technology is being used,” said Samantha Hoffman, a nonresident fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research who has studied China’s use of technology for security and propaganda.
     
            Places like the United States and the UK may have problems with how they implement that technology, too – but “this is fundamentally different… It has to do specifically with the system of government, as well as the way that the party state… uses the law to maintain its own power,” said Hoffman.
     
            Hong Kong has more than 54,500 public CCTV cameras used by government bodies – about seven cameras per 1,000 people, according to an estimate by Comparitech, a UK-based technology research firm.
     
            That puts it about on par with New York City and still far behind London (13 per 1,000 people), but nowhere near mainland Chinese cities, which average about 440 cameras per 1,000 people.
     
            Fears of mainland-style surveillance and policing caused notable angst during the 2019 protests, which broadened to encompass many Hong Kongers’ fears that the central Chinese government would encroach on the city’s limited autonomy.
     
            Protesters on the streets covered their faces with masks and goggles to prevent identification, at times smashing or covering security cameras. At one point, they tore down a “smart” lamp post, even though Hong Kong authorities said it was only meant to collect data on traffic, weather and pollution.
     
            At the time, activist and student leader Joshua Wong – who is now in prison on charges related to his activism and national security – said, “Can the Hong Kong government ensure that they will never install facial recognition tactics into the smart lamp post? … They can’t promise it and they won’t because of the pressure from Beijing.”
     
            Across the border, the model of surveillance that protesters feared is ubiquitous – with China often celebrating the various achievements of its real-time facial recognition algorithms, and exporting surveillance technology to countries around the world.
     
            According to an analysis by Comparitec, eight of the top 10 most surveilled cities in the world per capita are in China, where facial recognition is an inescapable part of daily life – from the facial scans required to register a new phone number, to facial recognition gates in some subway stations.
     
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, the government mandated a QR “health code” to track people’s health status, which in some places required facial scans.
     
            But the technology has also been used in more repressive ways.
     
            In the far-western region of Xinjiang, Beijing has used cameras to monitor members of the Muslim-majority Uyghur population. And when unprecedented nationwide protests broke out in late 2022 against the government’s strict Covid policies, police used facial recognition along with other sophisticated surveillance tools to track down protesters, The New York Times found.
 
            “(China’s) public security surveillance systems … tend to track lists of particular people, maybe people with a history of mental illness or participation in protests, and make a note of people who are marked as being troublesome in some way,” Hoffman said.
     
            The systems then “track those specific people across the city and across its surveillance network.”
     
            “I think it’s fair to anticipate that the use of CCTV and facial recognition technology in Hong Kong will begin to look a lot like those in mainland China over time,” she said.
     
            Hong Kong police have argued the cameras help fight crime, pointing to a pilot program earlier this year of 15 cameras installed in one district. Already, those cameras have provided evidence and clues for at least six crimes, Tang told Sing Tao Daily – and police will prioritize high-risk or high-crime areas for the remaining cameras.
     
            The first five months of this year saw 3% more crimes than the same period last year, Sing Tao reported.
     
            In their statement, police told CNN the new cameras would only monitor public places and delete footage after 31 days. They will follow existing personal data privacy laws, as well as “comprehensive and robust internal guidelines,” police said, without elaborating on what those guidelines entailed.
     
            When considering AI-equipped cameras, “the police will definitely comply with relevant laws,” the force added.
     
            But several experts interviewed by CNN cast doubt on whether those existing laws, written decades ago with broad exemptions for police, will be enough.
     
            Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, warned that the new cameras could be “used for political repression” if they are employed under the “draconian” national security law.
     
            Unless authorities assure the public that the cameras won’t be used for that purpose, “this is likely to be a further step in making Hong Kong law enforcement closer to how it is done on the Chinese mainland,” he said.
     
            Other experts argued it’s far too soon to say what the impact will be in Hong Kong, since authorities have not laid out in detail how they would use the technology.
     
            “Hong Kong law doesn’t, in all measures, mirror what happens in mainland China,” said Normann Witzleb, an associate professor in data protection and privacy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
     
            But that’s why it’s all the more important for authorities to address a raft of yet-unanswered questions, he said.
     
            For instance, it remains unclear whether Hong Kong will deploy live facial recognition that constantly scans the environment, or whether the tech will only be applied to past footage when certain crimes occur or when legal authorization is granted.
     
            Witzleb also raised the question of who would have the power to authorize the use of facial recognition, and what situations may warrant it. Would it be used to prosecute crime and locate suspects, for example – or for other public safety measures like identifying missing people?

            And, Witzleb added, will police run the technology through their existing image databases, or use it more broadly with images held by other public authorities, or even publicly available imagery of anyone?
     
            “It’s important to design guidelines for those systems that take proper recognition of the potential benefits that they have, but that also acknowledge they’re not foolproof, and that they have the potential to interfere with (people’s) rights in serious ways,” Witzleb said.
     
            Regardless of how facial recognition might be used, both Hoffman and Witzleb said the presence of that technology and the increased number of security cameras may make Hong Kongers feel less free under the ever-watchful eye of the police.
     
            “When you feel like you’re being monitored, that affects your behavior and your feelings of freedom as well,” Hoffman said. “I think that there’s an element of state coercion that doesn’t need to have to do with the effectiveness of the technology itself.”

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/china-comac-c919-experience-intl-hnk/index.html,The C919 is China’s answer to the A320. But what is it like onboard?,CNN’s Beijing bureau chief shares his experience flying on China’s first homegrown mainline passenger plane.,"Oct 4, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Steven Jiang,China,"
            I have flown more than a million miles with dozens of airlines around the world – and have lost count of how many times I’ve hopped on an Air China plane for the short trip from Beijing to Shanghai.
     
            During the week, airlines schedule more than 60 flights everyday between the country’s capital and financial hub – each way – often using their biggest jets, from the iconic Boeing 747 to the newest Airbus A350.
     
            With plenty of widebody options in its fleet of almost 1,000 planes, Air China deployed a narrowbody for my flight on a recent Thursday morning. But it wasn’t just any narrowbody – it was the flag carrier’s first, and so far the only, C919 jetliner.
     
            The C919 is China’s first homegrown mainline passenger plane, manufactured by the Shanghai-based state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). After spending years in development and lengthy delays, the twin-engine jet made its maiden commercial voyage with hometown carrier China Eastern Airlines in May 2023.
     
            Long touted as a potential game-changer in global commercial aviation, the C919 is COMAC’s answer to the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 – two of the world’s best-selling aircraft types.
     
            Despite recording more than 1,000 orders, the C919 seems dogged by skeptics who question its “Chineseness” (with key parts such as engines and flight control systems imported from the US and Europe) and its commercial viability given the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in the market.
     
            For an aviation geek like me, however, none of the controversies could dampen my enthusiasm to unlock a brand-new aircraft type and review this still rare passenger experience since there are only a handful of C919s in the air within mainland China, the only region it’s been certified to fly to date.
     
            I showed up at the gate at Beijing’s sprawling Capital International Airport (PEK) an hour before departure time to see the C919 in the flesh for the first time. From a distance, it could easily be mistaken for an A320 with its more rounded nose and curved fuselage (compared to the B737). More discerning eyes would probably notice the C919’s distinctive cockpit windows and wingtips.
     
            My first impression upon stepping into the month-old C919 was that it felt just like an A320 – with a bit of lingering new plane smell. To its credit, among the “Big Three” state-owned carriers that operate the aircraft type, Air China opted for the most spacious configuration with 158 seats (out of the possible maximum of 192) – eight in first class and 150 in economy.

            In this age of “cattle class” for economy fliers, any extra legroom counts. I had pre-paid for an emergency exit row seat and was more than pleased with the legroom for both exit rows (19 and 20), which offer more space than even domestic first class. As someone who is 180cm (or 5’11”) tall, I could easily stretch my legs all the way out with my feet barely touching the seat in front of me.
     
            Other aspects of the interior look more run-of-the-mill: There are individual air nozzles for customized climate control, and economy passengers not in exit rows each have a foldable device holder (for smartphones and tablets) just above the tray table.
     
            The economy seats themselves – in a typical 3x3 layout – are of the thin variety increasingly popular with airlines as they cram more rows into the main cabin.
     
            But any potential discomfort on this flight was mitigated by the free pillows – I put one behind me for extra padding. Beneath the seats, every three passengers share two sockets featuring both USB-A and USB-C plugs.
     
            For a jetliner with a range up to 5,555 kilometers (just under 3,500 miles), Air China’s C919 seems to count on passengers to provide their own inflight entertainment. While each seatback contains literature space (with actual inflight magazines) as well as pouches for personal items, there are no individual screens or WiFi onboard (programming shown on the drop-down screens seemed universally unappealing) – that must be where the device holder comes in.
     
            I was happy to hear the flight attendant highlight the aircraft type in his pre-takeoff briefing. “Today you’re flying with Air China C919 aircraft, which is the first large airliner independently developed by China,” he said, as the jet taxied to the runway.
     
            Air China serves hot meals in economy during meal hours even for short-haul flights (today’s flying time: 1 hour 40 minutes). Bottled water was placed in each seatback pouch before boarding and my omelet – along with yogurt and a chocolate bar – tasted totally fine.
     
            I checked out one of the two economy lavatories in the back of the cabin. It’s bright (and was clean and well-stocked on this flight), has a coat hook and feels less cramped than many of the latest versions on the A320 or B737.
     
            With the tops of Shanghai’s tallest skyscrapers emerging in the clouds, our plane began to descend toward Hongqiao International Airport (SHA).
     
            Sitting in the window seat next to the engine, I remembered one of the two main complaints about the C919 that I’d read online: engine noise. Everyone has different tolerance levels, but I didn’t find the sound to be much louder than that on a typical flight using a Boeing or Airbus narrowbody plane.

            The other complaint apparently was the lack of space in overhead bins. Even though the C919 isn’t going to win the overhead space competition, everyone on this full flight seemed to be able to fit in their wheeled carry-on luggage with no problem.
     
            Following a smooth touchdown in Shanghai some 40 minutes ahead of schedule, there was no applause or cheers (which is never a Chinese tradition on airplanes anyway). After deplaning, I noticed a few more passengers – perhaps made aware by the inflight announcement about the Chinese-made aircraft – taking photos of the C919.
     
            Saving a few bumps along the way, it was a decidedly uneventful journey. Most people – including frequent fliers like me – likely didn’t feel much difference flying this C919 compared to previous flights on the ubiquitous A320 or B737. As far as my passenger expectation goes, this C919 flight has earned a solid B in terms of safety and comfort.

            At the end of the day, travelers don’t usually choose flights based on aircraft type – unless they feel there’re compelling reasons to do so (as shown recently following several incidents involving Boeing jets).
     
            COMAC undoubtedly has a lot riding on the success of the C919, as the Chinese government tries to upgrade key industries and reduce reliance on Western technology. Geopolitics and national pride aside, though, for a passenger aircraft program to soar, analysts have pointed out that COMAC needs to prove the C919’s reliability to potential operators in Southeast Asia, Africa and other emerging markets – in the absence of quick certification by US and European regulators.
     
            If more passengers continue to have “remarkably unremarkable” experiences on the C919, COMAC may just be able to turn its jetliner from a show horse to the workhorse of airlines in China and beyond.

China’s Coast Guard claimed it entered waters of the Arctic Ocean for the first time as part of a joint patrol with Russia – in the latest sign of enhanced coordination between the two in a region where Beijing has long wished to expand its footprint.
     
            The statement came a day after the US Coast Guard said it spotted four vessels from the Russian Border Guard and Chinese Coast Guard in the Bering Sea – the “northernmost” location it said it had ever observed the Chinese ships.
     
            The joint patrol “effectively expanded the scope of the coast guard’s ocean-going navigation” and tested their ability “to carry out missions in unfamiliar waters,” the China Coast Guard (CCG) said in a post on its official social media account Wednesday.
     
            The CCG did not release the exact location of the patrol. A banner visible on one of the vessels in accompanying photos read “China Coast Guard devoting its heart to the Party; demonstrating loyalty in the Arctic Ocean,” referring to China’s ruling Communist Party.
     
            The Russian government has not officially acknowledged the patrol, which Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said took place “a few days ago.” Russian state media TASS published a report on the patrol, citing the CCG statement.
     
            The US Coast Guard (USCG) on Monday said it spotted the four vessels from the Russian Border Guard and Chinese Coast Guard “transiting in formation in a northeast direction” in the Bering Sea, some five miles inside Russia’s Exclusive Economic Zone on Saturday.
     
            The Bering Sea stretches between Russia and Alaska and is part of the North Pacific Ocean. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait, a narrow passage separating Asia and North America.
     
            “This recent activity demonstrates the increased interest in the Arctic by our strategic competitors,” Rear Adm. Megan Dean, commander of the 17th Coast Guard District, said in the USCG statement.
     
            The US has raised concerns about China’s growing role and coordination with Russia in the strategically and environmentally sensitive Arctic region, as the two countries tighten their security and economic ties more broadly.
     
            US and Canadian forces in July intercepted Russian and Chinese bombers flying together near Alaska for the first time, while their two navies operated together in international waters off the Alaskan coast in 2022 and 2023, according to the US military.
     
            Last year, CCG and Russia’s Federal Security Service, which operates its coast guard, agreed to strengthen their “maritime law enforcement cooperation” and China was invited to observe Russia’s “Arctic Patrol-2023” security drills.
     
            Analysts say the new patrol is part of a broader pattern of collaboration – and designed to send a message to Washington, whose maritime activities in the South and East China Seas have longed irked Beijing.
     
            “The significance of the (China) Coast Guard operating farther north than it has ever done implies (China) is extending its Coast Guard into areas the US has traditionally considered its own domain,” said Carl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
     
            “China in particular is signaling that the US Coast Guard is not the only one that (can) operate within and near other countries’ Economic Exclusion Zones from their own home waters,” he said.
     
            Beijing has for years sought to increase its footprint in the Arctic, declaring itself a “near Arctic state” and beefing up its icebreaker and research capabilities in the region, where it’s also heavily invested in Russian energy projects.
     
            Russia, as one of eight Arctic states, has historically been wary of being too welcoming to China in a region key to its own security and military power.
     
            But observers say Moscow’s increasing reliance on China – its most important diplomatic and economic partner – in the wake of its war on Ukraine may be changing that calculus.
     
            In its first update to its Arctic strategy in five years, the US Department of Defense in July warned that “growing cooperation” between Russia and China in the region has the “potential to alter the Arctic’s stability and threat picture.”

China and Russia are ramping up joint military drills. What’s their end goal?
 
            The recent joint activities, including the July patrol near Alaska, raise questions of whether Russia’s focus on controlling access to the Russian Arctic is “increasingly overshadowed by economic and political considerations,” said Sophie Arts, a fellow with the German Marshall Fund of the US’s Geostrategy North team.
     
            “However, when it comes to growing Russian willingness to cater to Chinese interests, we have to take into account the location in which these activities are taking place,” she added, pointing to how the strategically peripheral patrol location suggests “Russian concerns about controlling access and maintaining its bastion (of) defense remain a priority.”
     
            Andreas Østhagen, a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway, expressed skepticism that Chinese vessels had operated in the Arctic Ocean proper.
     
            He said that operating north of the Bering Strait normally requires ice-breaking capabilities and noted that the US Coast Guard did not report the ships entered the Bering Strait, where the Arctic Ocean starts. CNN has reached out to the USCG for comment.
     
            “It still links to the wider Arctic region, even if this is not the Arctic Ocean. Operating off the coast of Alaska or in the Bering Sea at large is part of an ongoing trend where China is asserting its ability to be present in the Arctic, or near the Arctic,” he said.
     
            The China Coast Guard is part of the country’s People’s Armed Police, which is under the command of the Central Military Commission – and it has frequently been at the frontline of China’s efforts to assert its territorial claims in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
     
            The Philippines, for example, has repeatedly accused the CCG of targeting its fishing and other ships with water canons and other tactics, including in what it described as a “brutal assault” with bladed weapons on Filipino forces in June.
     
            In addition to projecting strength, Beijing has a practical interest in expanding its cooperation with Russia and presence in far north waters, where its coast guard could in the future protect its economic interests, experts say.

How the Ukraine war brought China and Russia closer together
 
            In its 2018 Arctic policy, Beijing described its vision for a “Polar Silk Road,” linking Asia to Europe by developing shipping routes like the Northern Sea Route across the Arctic and down to China. That route, now largely navigable only in summer and autumn, is expected to become more commercially viable for global shipping as climate change melts sea ice.
     
            Transit along the Northern Sea Route during the summer-autumn navigation season is poised to hit record levels of transit cargo by the season’s end, according to data from the Centre for High North Logistics affiliated with Norway’s Nord University. As of September 30, about 95% of the cargo volume along the route went from Russia to China, it said in a recent report.
     
            The coast guard collaboration “relates to Chinese interests in maritime transportation along at least parts of the Northern Sea Route,” according to Østhagen. “The fact that they have initiated these types of operations is yet another step in the ongoing practical cooperation between the two states in an Arctic or near-Arctic context.”
     
            And when taken alongside other recent joint operations, “this is all about expanding both the Chinese footprint in this part of the Arctic and China’s abilities to operate this far north,” he said.

            Vietnam on Wednesday protested to China over what it said was an attack on a Vietnamese fishing boat three days ago in contested South China Sea waters that injured several fishermen.
     
            The Vietnamese foreign ministry said in a statement that Chinese law enforcers beat the Vietnamese fishermen and took away their fishing equipment when their boat was operating near Hoang Sa, Vietnam’s name for the Paracel Islands. China calls the Paracels the Xisha Islands.
     
            The Chinese-controlled islands, also claimed by Vietnam, are in the South China Sea, a busy global maritime waterway, almost all of which is claimed by China.
     
            “Vietnam is extremely concerned, indignant and resolutely protests the brutal treatment by Chinese law enforcement forces of Vietnamese fishermen and fishing boats operating in the Hoang Sa archipelago of Vietnam,” foreign ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said in a statement.
     
            The ministry delivered a strong protest to the Chinese embassy in Hanoi demanding that China respect Vietnam’s sovereignty, investigate the incident and desist from further such actions, Hang said.
     
            Vietnamese state media reported this week that around 40 people from two foreign vessels had beaten the fishermen with iron pipes, injuring 10.
     
            China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the Vietnamese boats had been fishing illegally in Paracel waters without the permission of the Beijing government, and that Chinese authorities had taken measures to stop them.
     
            “The on-site operations were professional and restrained, and no injuries were found,” it said in response to a Reuters request for comment, without specifically referring to the attack.

            The five, who were University of Michigan students at the time, were not charged for what happened at Camp Grayling in August 2023. Rather they are accused of misleading investigators about the trip and conspiring to clear their phones of photos, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court.
     
            The FBI noted in the Tuesday court filing that there have been instances of college students from China taking photos of vital defense sites in the United States.
     
            There was nothing in the file revealing the whereabouts of the five men.
     
            “The defendants are not in custody. Should they come into contact with U.S. authorities, they will be arrested and face these charges,” Gina Balaya, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit, said Wednesday.
     
            In summer 2023, the five were confronted after midnight near a lake by a sergeant major with the Utah National Guard. One said, “We are media,” before they collected their belongings and agreed to leave the area, the FBI said.
     
            The FBI learned that the men had booked a room at a nearby motel a week before they were spotted outside Camp Grayling, 200 miles north of Detroit.
     
            Four months later, one of the men was interviewed by border officers at the Detroit airport before traveling to South Korea and China. He told investigators that he and others had taken a trip to northern Michigan “to see shooting stars,” the FBI said.
     
            A check of his external hard drive revealed two images of military vehicles taken on the same night of the encounter with the National Guard officer, the FBI said.
     
            The other four men were interviewed last March after arriving in Chicago on a flight from Iceland. They acknowledged being in northern Michigan in August 2023, but they said it was to see a meteor shower, the FBI said.
     
            They mentioned the National Guard officer but referred to him only as “the soldier,” a camper or “nice guy,” according to the criminal complaint.
     
            The men last December communicated on WeChat about clearing photos from their cameras and phones, investigators said.
     
            The FBI said all five men graduated last spring from the University of Michigan. They were part of a joint program between the university and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China.
     
            In 2020, two Chinese nationals who were pursuing master’s degrees at the University of Michigan were sentenced to prison for illegally photographing sites at a naval air station in Key West, Florida.

            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on Tuesday he “misspoke” when he previously said he’d visited Hong Kong in the spring of 1989 during protests in China’s Tiananmen Square but insisted he “was in Hong Kong and China” during the pro-democracy protests.
     
            His comments during Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate followed the unearthing of reports that contradict previous claims he made about his travel to China, including a claim that the Democratic vice presidential nominee was in Hong Kong preparing for a teaching position in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests that ended in hundreds of protesters killed by the Chinese government.
     
            “My community knows who I am. They saw where I was at,” Walz said during the debate. “Look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. I’ve tried to do the best I can, but I’ve not been perfect, and I’m a knucklehead at times, but it’s always been about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for 12 years.”
     
            When pressed by CBS News’ moderators specifically about the discrepancy between his past comments and the media reports on his travel, Walz first said he “misspoke” on this.
     
            “All I said on this was, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just – that’s what I’ve said,” he said, before adding, “I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests went in. And from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in, in governance,” he said.
     
            Walz regularly organized and chaperoned trips to China during his time as a teacher prior to entering politics.
     
            He previously said he visited Hong Kong in “May of ’89,” weeks before the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. During a 2014 hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China honoring the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, Walz, then a Minnesota congressman, appeared to recall specific details of his trip to the region at that time.

            “As a young man, I was just going to teach high school in Foshan in Guangdong, and was in Hong Kong in May of ’89,” he said. “And as the events were unfolding, several of us went in. And I still remember the train station in Hong Kong.”
     
            “The opportunity to be in a Chinese high school at that critical time seemed to me to be really important. And it was a very interesting summer to say the least. Because if you recall, as we moved in that summer and further on and the news blackouts and things that went on, you certainly can’t black out news from people if they want to get it,” he continued.
     
            Walz further claimed in a June 2019 radio interview that he was in Hong Kong on June 4, 1989 – the day of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
     
            “I was in Hong Kong on June 4, 1989, when, of course, Tiananmen Square happened. And I was in China after that. It was very strange ‘cause, of course, all outside transmissions were, were blocked – Voice of America – and, of course, there was no, no phones or email or anything. So I was kind of out of touch. It took me a month to know the Berlin Wall had fallen when I was living there,” he said.

            During a 2009 hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to commemorate the Tiananmen Square protests, Walz claimed that he was in Hong Kong at the time, preparing to go teach in China.
     
            “Twenty years ago today, I was in Hong Kong preparing to go to Foshan to teach at Foshan No. 1 Middle School,” he said. “To watch what happened at the end of the day on June 4 was something that many of us will never forget, we pledge to never forget, and bearing witness and accurate telling of history is absolutely crucial for any nation to move forward.”
     
            Walz’s claims that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests have been repeated in media reports. But contemporaneous newspaper reports first resurfaced by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet, place Walz in Nebraska around that time. An issue of the Alliance Times-Herald dated May 16, 1989, features a photo of Walz touring a Nebraska National Guard storeroom. In the photo’s caption, the paper notes that Walz “will take over the job” of staffing the storeroom from a retiring guardsman and “will be moving to Alliance,” Nebraska. A separate newspaper article about Walz’s planned trip to China published by a Nebraska-based outlet in April 1989 reported that he planned to travel to China in early August of that year.
     
            When asked by CNN if Walz was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, the Harris campaign was unable to provide evidence to substantiate Walz’s claim.
     
            A source close to Walz told CNN that “the point Gov. Walz is making when he discusses this is that some folks in the World Teach program discussed dropping out after Tiananmen Square, but he continued on with the program because he believed it was important for the Chinese people to learn about American democracy and American history.”
     
            The contradiction was first reported by Minnesota Public Radio News and APM Reports.
     
            Walz also appears to have exaggerated the number of times he’s traveled to China. In a 2016 interview, he said he’s visited China “about 30 times.” In another meeting of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, in 2016, Walz claimed to have visited Hong Kong “dozens and dozens and dozens of times.”
     
            When asked for clarification on how many times Walz traveled to China, a Harris campaign spokesperson told CNN the number of trips Walz took to China is “likely closer to 15.”

            China has long held a significant place in Walz’s life since he first traveled to the country in 1989. Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, were married on June 4, 1994 – the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and spent their honeymoon leading students in an educational trip to China, something Walz did regularly during his time as a teacher before joining Congress. Ahead of their wedding, Gwen Walz told the Nebraska-based Star-Herald newspaper that they planned to get married on the Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary because “he wanted to have a date he’ll always remember.”
     
            Since joining the Harris campaign, Walz has not spoken at length about China or his history of travel to the country.
     
            Republicans in recent days have circled Walz’s ties to China as a target for further scrutiny. Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Donald Trump’s campaign, indicated Monday that he expects Vance to attack Walz for his history of trips to China.
     
            “Tiananmen Tim! Funny they’re changing this now – we were planning on calling him out for this at the debate tomorrow night! Anything else you want to fess up to, Tim???,” Miller said in a social media post in response to clarification offered by the Harris campaign about Walz’s trips to China.
     
            Congressional Republicans have joined the Trump campaign in calling into question Walz’s ties to China. House Oversight Chairman James Comer subpoenaed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday for documents related to Walz as part of allegations made by “whistleblower disclosures” provided to the committee that Walz has ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The subpoena is the latest step by House Republicans to spotlight Walz’s ties to China through a probe that began in August shortly after he joined the Democratic ticket.
     
            The inconsistencies around Walz’s travel to China and Hong Kong mark the latest instance in which the governor’s past comments have been revealed to be inaccurate since he became the Democratic vice presidential nominee. In August, a Harris campaign spokesperson said Walz “misspoke” in a 2018 video in which he said he handled assault weapons “in war.”
     
            Later that month, Gwen Walz clarified that the couple had used a fertility treatment other than in vitro fertilization to conceive after her husband had suggested they had used IVF.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated his pledge to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan on the eve of Communist China’s 75th birthday, as Beijing flexed its military might in the run-up to the national holiday.
     
            At a state banquet celebrating the founding of the People’s Republic on Monday, Xi used his address to underscore his resolve to achieve the “complete reunification of the motherland.”
     
            “It’s an irreversible trend, a cause of righteousness and the common aspiration of the people. No one can stop the march of history,” he told the thousands in attendance at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its own, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to “reunify” with the self-governing democracy, by force if necessary.
     
            But many people on the island view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of Communist China.
     
            The two sides have been ruled by separate governments since 1949, after the end of the Chinese civil war. The communists took power in Beijing and founded the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949, while the defeated nationalists fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of the Republic of China from the mainland to Taipei.
     
            Successive Chinese leaders have vowed to one day take control of Taiwan, but Xi, China’s most assertive leader in decades, has ramped up rhetoric and aggression against the democratic island – fueling tension across the strait and raising concerns for a military confrontation.
     
            “Taiwan is China’s sacred territory. Blood is thicker than water, and people on both sides of the strait are connected by blood,” Xi told the banquet attended by more than 3,000 people, including officials, retired party leaders and foreign dignitaries.
     
            He also called for deeper economic and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and promotion of “spiritual harmony of compatriots on both sides.”
     
            “(We must) resolutely oppose ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities,” Xi said.
     
            Beijing has labeled Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te a “dangerous separatist,” and tensions have ratcheted up since Lai’s inauguration in May, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan.
     
            Taiwan officials say Beijing has intensified military activities around the island in recent months, including drills in May that the Chinese military said were designed to test its ability to “seize power” over the island.
     
            On Sunday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it was on alert after detecting “multiple waves” of missile firing deep in inland China.
     
            The missiles were fired by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force in the inland regions of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang, the ministry said in a statement, adding that Taiwan’s air defense forces have “maintained a high level of vigilance and strengthened their alert.”
     
            It comes just days after China fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean for the first time in 44 years, in a rare public test that analysts said was meant to send a message to the United States and its allies amid heightened regional tensions.
     
            The issue of Taiwan has become a major point of contention between China and the US, which maintains close but informal relations with Taipei and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself.
     
            On Sunday, US President Joe Biden approved an additional $567 million in military support for Taiwan in the largest aid package America has granted the island. The funding will cover defense articles as well as “military education and training,” the White House said in a statement.

China has taken a step forward in its ambitious plan to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 – unveiling the specially designed spacesuit its crew will don for what’s expected to be a landmark mission in the country’s space program.
     
            The new red-and-white suit – revealed by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) over the weekend – is made to withstand the moon’s extreme temperatures, as well as radiation and dust, while allowing astronauts physical flexibility to perform tasks on the lunar surface, according to state media.
     
            The moon-landing suit is equipped with a built-in long and short-range camera, an operations console, and a glare-proof helmet visor, according to a video shared by state broadcaster CCTV, which featured well-known Chinese astronauts Zhai Zhigang and Wang Yaping demonstrating how astronauts wearing the suit can bend and climb a ladder.
     
            The new technology has caught international attention.
     
            SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared a post on the platform X featuring the CCTV video and his own caption.
     
            “Meanwhile, back in America, the [Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)] is smothering the national space program in kafkaesque paperwork!” he wrote, in an apparent reference to the perceived speed with which China has bolstered its space program relative to the US.
     
            CNN has reached out to FAA for comment.
     
            SpaceX’s fortunes – and Musk’s personal wealth – have been boosted in recent years by huge government contracts as NASA has sought to tap into the private sector on space exploration and logistics.
     
            China’s reveal of the moon-landing spacesuit comes as the country has mounted a significant effort to establish itself a major player in space – a domain that nations, including the United States, are increasingly looking to not only for scientific benefit, but also with an eye to resources and national security.
     
            The China National Space Administration has in recent years carried out a series of increasingly complex robotic lunar missions, including the first-ever return of lunar samples from the far side of the moon earlier this year. It has been angling to become the second country to land astronauts on the moon, saying its first crewed mission will take place “by 2030.”
     
            The US, which has not sent astronauts to the moon since 1972, is also planning to send a crew this decade, though it has delayed its initial timeline for its Artemis III mission. That mission will not take off until at least September 2026, NASA said earlier this year. The agency revealed a protoype of its Artemis III spacesuit prototype, the AxEMU, in 2023.
     
            China’s new spacesuit was hailed across state media as a major step forward in the country’s crewed mission timeline, with experts noting the need for specifically formulated suit for lunar conditions versus those used in spacewalks by astronauts at China’s Tiangong orbital space station.

            Thanks to its thin exosphere, the moon is an unforgiving place, exposed to both the sun’s rays and the cold of space. Temperatures near the Moon’s equator, for example, can spike to 250°F (121°C) in the day and then plunge at night to -208°F (-133°C), according to NASA.
     
            “Unlike low-Earth orbit missions, astronauts will be in a harsh natural lunar environment during lunar extravehicular activities. Complex environmental factors such as high vacuum and low gravity, lunar dust and lunar soil, complex lunar surface terrain, high and low temperatures, and strong radiation will have a significant impact on work and protection,” Wu Zhiqiang, deputy chief designer of astronaut systems at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center, told state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            Others also hailed the aesthetics of the suit, with state media describing the red stripes on its upper limbs are inspired by ribbons from the “flying apsaras,” or deities that appear in ancient art in western China’s Dunhuang city, while those on its lower limbs resembling “rocket launch flames.”
     
            Another designer, Wang Chunhui, told state media the suit’s proportions would make the astronauts “look more spirited and majestic” and “make us Chinese look strong and beautiful when we step on the moon.”
     
            Earlier this year, Chinese officials released the name of the spacecraft for the crewed lunar mission – with the spaceship dubbed Mengzhou, or Dream Vessel, the lander, Lanyue, or Embracing the Moon.
     
            The mission is designed as part of a broader set of lunar ambitions, which include China’s plans to establish an international lunar research station at the moon’s south pole by 2040.

            Hot Stocks 


 
            For much of the past year since China reopened to the world following the Covid-19 pandemic, a pall has hung over large swathes of the country as its economy struggles to regain momentum.
     
            The country’s bright young minds are having a hard time landing a job; its white-collar professionals are hit by pay cuts and layoffs; its entrepreneurs struggle to finance their businesses and pay off debts; its middle-class families are seeing their wealth slashed by crumbling housing prices; and its rich race to move money out of the country.
     
            In the months leading up to the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic on Tuesday, the mood was encapsulated by a new buzz phrase: “the garbage time of history.” Like the final minutes of a basketball game with one team trailing so far behind that all efforts to win seem futile, some Chinese believe their country is trapped in a similarly bleak period with little hope for a turnaround.
     
            The pessimism was a far cry from the buoyant outlook just five years ago, during the last major National Day celebrations in 2019. Back then, economists were rushing to predict when China might overtake the United States to become the world’s largest economy. Those conversations aren’t happening much anymore. These days, the talk centers on how Beijing can avoid a repeat of Japan’s “lost decade” of economic stagnation following bursting of its housing bubble in the 1990s.
     
            Last week, after months of increasingly grim economic data, Chinese leader Xi Jinping finally gave the nod to a much-needed stimulus package in a bid to shore up faith in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            On Tuesday, the country’s central bank unveiled a raft of measures to counter falling prices, including freeing commercial banks to lend more money and making it cheaper for households and companies to borrow.
     
            Officials kept up the positive drumbeat the next day by announcing rare cash handouts to disadvantaged citizens and pledging subsidies for recent graduates struggling to find a job.
     
            And on Thursday, the ruling Communist Party’s 24-member Politburo continued the bullish messaging. In a break with tradition, Xi dedicated the group’s September meeting to economic affairs.
     
            The top officials acknowledged that “new situations and problems” have arisen in the economy and demanded urgent action, vowing to boost fiscal spending, arrest the decline of the property market and improve employment for fresh graduates and migrant workers.
     
            According to Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, the “rare, simultaneous rollout of so many measures underscored the urgency for policymakers to prop up the economy.”
     
            The policy blitz gave an adrenaline shot to the country’s dismal stock market days before the week-long national holiday, which starts on Tuesday. China’s blue-chips stocks soared more than 15% last week in its biggest single-week gain in nearly 16 years. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index surged 13%, notching its best week since 1998, according to Reuters.
     
            The frenzy continued on Monday, when the combined turnover on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses exceeded 1.8 trillion yuan ($228 billion), logging a record high, according to the Securities Times, a state-run financial newspaper. That’s despite a key measure of factory activity, the official purchasing managers’ index (PMI), shrinking for another month in September.
     
            Even some big-name investors are excited by the rally. David Tepper, the billionaire founder of American hedge fund Appaloosa Management, told CNBC in an interview Thursday that he was buying more of “everything” related to China.
     
            The stock market may be in the midst of one of its most remarkable turnarounds, but economists say reversing China’s economic downturn will require much more work.
     
            “Stimulating the stock market doesn’t really do much for the real economy in China. Very few people invest in the stock market compared to other major markets,” said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group.

            Chinese households have suffered a massive loss of wealth from a slump in the housing market, amounting to an estimated $18 trillion, Barclays economists said in a research note earlier this month. It’s as if each three-person household in China has lost around $60,000, an amount that is almost five times China’s per capita gross domestic product.
     
            Wright said the stimulus package “makes the leadership look more reactive, more responsive to the downturn in the economy. And that is what’s generated some of the more positive sentiment (last) week. But nothing really changes in terms of the structural outlook.”
     
            China’s decades-long investment-led growth has reached “a dead end,” and fundamental overhauls of its fiscal system — including a redistribution of income and greater transfers to households — are needed to rebalance the economy toward a more sustainable consumption-led growth model, Wright said.
     
            There has been little in the barrage of measures announced last week to address the underlying structural problems weighing down economic growth.
     
            China has long had one of the highest saving rates in the world. While one-off cash handouts and subsidies may boost short-term consumption, robust social welfare and healthcare are needed to make Chinese households feel comfortable to spend more in the long run, especially following the collapse of the property sector, where most Chinese invest their savings.
     
            The outlook for the real estate industry, which makes up about a quarter of the Chinese economy and 70% of household wealth, remains dim.
     
            “There’s not much Beijing can do,” Wright said. “In many ways, the adjustment in the property sector is almost complete, and policy hasn’t been very effective in stabilizing it.”
     
            After decades of boom, China’s real estate sector is now in its fourth year of contraction since falling into a deep crisis in 2020, when the government cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers to rein in their high debt. Beijing’s efforts to rescue the market have struggled to revive demand, with prices of new homes continuing their freefall.
     
            In a concerted push to prop up the embattled property market, the southern metropolis of Guangzhou became China’s first tier-one city to lift all restrictions on home purchases on Sunday, while Shanghai and Shenzhen also eased rules for home buyers.
     
            The country now has so many empty apartments that not even all of its 1.4 billion people are enough to fill them. To make matters worse, the population has been shrinking for two years, a demographic shift that could further hobble future growth.

            The Chinese government’s efforts to encourage births has also failed. More and more young people are delaying marriage and childbirth, if not foregoing them all together. Many feel jaded or burnt out from “involution” – a catchphrase describing the intense competition that has dominated their lives, from striving for academic excellence to building a successful career. Some are resorting to “lying flat” or “letting it rot,” a form of passive resistance against society’s pressure by doing just enough to get by.
     
            These buzzwords sum up a growing sense of despair among China’s disenchanted youth. Some are finding the arc of their lives increasingly out of sync with the expected upward trajectory described in Xi’s “China dream,” a grand vision of “unstoppable” national rejuvenation.
     
            Having grown up in an era of breakneck economic growth and ever-improving living standards, China’s Gen-Zs are now reckoning with the possibility that they might not do better than their parents, whose generation accepted limited freedoms in exchange for promised prosperity.
     
            Over the past years, China’s youth have watched their personal freedoms shrink under Xi’s authoritarian rule and their job prospects dim in a flagging economy.
     
            Xi’s crackdown on the private sector, from big tech to private tutoring, has eliminated many jobs once available to China’s fresh graduates. The youth unemployment rate soared to 18.8% in August, the highest since authorities changed the methodology last year to exclude students.
     
            That poses a potential problem for the Communist Party, which has for decades staked its legitimacy on the country’s unprecedented growth. As the economy slows, Xi has bolstered another pillar of the regime’s legitimacy: nationalism, which he is expected to invoke to mark the country’s 75th anniversary on Tuesday.
     
            But Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said Chinese leaders are not “planning on giving up the economic performance argument yet.”
     
            “They want to restore confidence in the economy, but the most troublesome headache for the Communist Party is they don’t have effective solutions to the economic slowdown.”

            The billionaire owner of French luxury powerhouse LVMH has seen his wealth inflate by $17 billion dollars in just one day, after China announced fresh moves to restore economic growth that some call the long-awaited “bazookas” needed to revive confidence.
     
            Bernard Arnault isn’t the only winner. China and Hong Kong stocks are on track to log their best weekly performances in 16 years, according to Reuters, following the surprise stimulus measures and strong words from the Chinese leadership.
     
            Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, started Thursday having lost more wealth this year than any other billionaire, with his fortune having declined by $24 billion due to a slump in the market for high-end goods, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
     
            But by the end of the day, his net worth jumped by $17 billion to $201 billion, the index reported, calling it his third-biggest daily increase ever. That’s after shares in LVMH rallied by just under 10% in Paris on hopes the Chinese leadership would succeed in their efforts to resuscitate the economy, which could bring back demand for luxury goods.
     
            LVMH said in July that sales had dropped 10% in the first six months of this year in its Asia region compared to 2023. That market, which accounted for 31% of total revenue last year, is dominated by China.
     
            China’s faltering economy had been hurting many Western brands. The country is grappling with a number of challenges, from sluggish consumer spending and a persistent property slump to a mounting debt crisis at local governments.
     
            For months, economists had been asking Chinese officials to do much more to boost flagging prospects for the world’s second-largest economy, which was at risk of missing its own 5% target growth rate. This week, they appear to be heeding those calls.
     
            “Beijing seems finally determined to roll out its bazooka stimulus in rapid succession,” analysts at investment bank Nomura wrote in a research note on Thursday. “Beijing’s recognition of the severe situation of the economy and lack of success in a piecemeal approach should be valued by markets.”
     
            In fact, China and Hong Kong stocks are on track as of Friday to notch their best week since 2008. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index has added just over 12% so far this week, while mainland China’s blue-chip CSI300 has gained more than 15%.
     
            Investors cheered news from Thursday that China’s 24-member Politburo, a top decision-making body, had dedicated its just concluded September monthly meeting to economic issues, which was a deviation from the previous procedure.
     
            Chaired by leader Xi Jinping, officials vowed to boost “counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies,” to help low- and middle-income citizens and to improve the ailing property market, which is in its fourth year of contraction.
     
            The announcement came two days after Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), unveiled a package of measures to support businesses by cutting one of its main interest rates and reducing the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve, which would free up money for lending.
     
            The seven-day reverse repo rate was cut from 1.7% to 1.5%. The PBOC also cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks by half a percentage point, which would free up about 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) for new lending.
     
            Pan additionally revealed cuts to existing mortgages and lowered the minimum mortgage downpayment from 25% to 15% for second-time homebuyers to support the ailing property sector, which many economists believe is the root cause of China’s numerous economic woes.
     
            However, experts urged investors to be cautious as officials must still come up with ways of stabilizing the property market, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity. It began to cool in 2019 and fell into a deep trough about two years later, after a government-led clampdown on developers’ borrowing.

            Hong Kong rolled out the red carpet Thursday to receive two giant pandas gifted by the Chinese government to mark 75 years of Communist Party rule, part of a citywide push by authorities to deepen patriotism.
     
            An An and Ke Ke, both five years old, landed around 11 a.m. at Hong Kong International Airport, where they were greeted by a welcoming ceremony.
     
            But fans hoping to catch a glimpse of them will have to wait until December, as they will spend the next 30 days in quarantine and more time to adapt to the new habitat in the southern Chinese city.
     
            Elite police motorcyclists, who normally escort visiting VIPs, ushered them to their new home across town at Ocean Park, where the pair join four other pandas at the theme park.
     
            An An and Ke Ke arrived from a breeding center in mainland China’s Sichuan province. Staff in the metropolis of Chengdu sprung into action as early as 2 a.m. to ferry the pandas to the airport for the 1,350-kilometer (840-mile) journey, carried in crates with a supply of snacks.
     
            They used forklifts to load the duo onto a truck, as a line of staff bade farewell from the curb, according to footage from Hong Kong’s public broadcaster RTHK.
     
            A panda keeper from Ocean Park has been in Chengdu since July to enable the bears to acclimatize to his scent and voice, the theme park said on its Instagram page, adding that staff had also introduced bamboo from southern China to their diet.
     
            An An, a male weighing 130 kilograms, is “strong, nimble and clever,” while Ke Ke, a female weighing 100 kilograms, is “good at climbing, gentle and cute,” the city’s Chief Executive John Lee told at a press conference on Tuesday.
     
            They bring the total number of pandas in the city to six, joining Le Le and Ying Ying who were gifted to Hong Kong in 2007. Ying Ying made headlines in August by giving birth to twins, making her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
     
            While these animals are not leaving China, their journey does carry an undertone of “panda diplomacy.” Beijing loans pandas to more than 20 countries as envoys of friendship, which is at times seen as a barometer of relations.
     
            China offers Hong Kong a preferential treatment. The two pandas given to the city will get to stay permanently – so will their cubs in the future – unlike their counterparts loaned overseas where countries have to return them at a certain age, according to Paulo Pong Kin-yee, chairman of Ocean Park.
     
            Their arrival also has a political objective, coming as Hong Kong officials drum up enthusiasm for the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China on October 1.
     
            “I would like to once again express my sincere gratitude to the central government for its care and support for Hong Kong for gifting two beloved and energetic giant pandas to Hong Kong,” Lee, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, said on Tuesday.

            Activists in Hong Kong used to protest for greater democracy on October 1. But crackdowns by city authorities have left opposition figures largely in jail or exile since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020.
     
            Chinese and Hong Kong officials say the law has helped return the financial hub to stability following mass protests in 2019. They have vowed to instill a new culture of Chinese patriotism among Hong Kongers and crack down on what they call “foreign interference.”
     
            The US government, its allies and human rights groups have criticized the national security crackdown for eroding individual freedoms and ending the international business hub’s once outspoken and freewheeling culture.
     
            Ahead of this year’s celebrations, Chinese flags are up in many parts of the city alongside giant billboards hailing the anniversary with preparations underway for a litany of events aimed at boosting patriotism, including a lengthy fireworks show on Tuesday evening.
     
            Kevin Yeung, the city’s minister for culture, sports and tourism, said Wednesday he hoped the pandas’ arrival “can make Hong Kong feel more deeply about the care of the central government.”

China says it successfully fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, a rare public test that analysts said was meant to send a message to the United States and its allies amid heightened regional tensions.
     
            An ICBM carrying a dummy warhead was launched at 8:44 a.m. Beijing time and fell into a designated area in the high seas of the Pacific Ocean, the Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement. It did not specify the missile’s flight path or landing location.
     
            The ministry said the launch, by the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force, was part of its routine annual training and not directed at any country or target. It comes as China and Russia conduct joint naval exercises in nearby seas close to Japan.
     
            The launch “effectively tested the performance of weapons and equipment as well as the training level of the troops, and achieved the expected objectives,” state news agency Xinhua said in a separate report, adding that China had “notified relevant countries in advance” of the test.
     
            A Pentagon spokesperson said the US received “some advanced notification” of the test from Beijing, calling it “a step in the right direction … to preventing any misperception or miscalculation.”
     
            Wednesday’s launch marks the first time China has tested an ICBM over the Pacific Ocean in more than four decades.
     
            In 1980, China test-fired its first ICBM, the DF-5, into the South Pacific from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the country’s northwest, traversing a distance of more than 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles).
     
            China has quietly conducted more ICBM tests since then, mostly over its own territory, with many landing in the deserts of the far western region of Xinjiang.
     
            In December 2013, a Chinese defense ministry spokesperson was asked at a regular news conference about an ICBM test launched from a submarine in the Bohai Sea, an inland sea off China’s northeast coast.
     
            “It is normal for China to conduct scientific research experiments within its territory according to plan,” the spokesperson replied.
     
            China’s defense ministry and state media offered little details about the test on Wednesday, including the type of ICBM launched. The country’s latest ICBM, known to be the DF-41, is estimated to have a range of 12,000 to 15,000 kilometers (7,400 to 9,300 miles) and is capable of reaching the US mainland.
     
            Analysts said China’s rare announcement of the test was intended as a warning to the US and its allies amid rising tensions in surrounding waters, from the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait to the South China Sea.
     
            Beijing’s test was a message to Washington that “direct intervention in a conflict across the Taiwan Strait would involve the American homeland being vulnerable to attack,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.

            “To US allies in Asia, China’s provocative test, conducted during its expansive regional military exercises, demonstrates its capabilities to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously,” he added.
     
            Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said the timing of the public test was potentially significant.
     
            “China launches a lot of missiles. They don’t announce a lot of them. It’s interesting that they would choose now,” he said.
     
            The public test comes as China adopts an increasingly assertive stance in the region.
     
            Over the past weeks, Japan has strongly protested incursions by Chinese and Russian military aircraft into its airspace; Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions near a dangerous new flashpoint; and Taiwan says China has recently been conducting intensive missile firing and other military drills near the self-ruled island.
     
            “This is quite a statement to launch a ballistic missile into the Pacific at this time when China is in conflict with many of its neighbors,” Thompson said. “This launch is a powerful signal intended to intimidate everyone.”
     
            Another key question is which countries China notified in advance of the launch, Thompson said.

China has more ICBM launchers than US, senior general tells lawmakers
 
            “There’s a long-standing global norm of notifying countries when certain long-range ballistic missiles are launched to prevent the risk of miscalculation,” he said. “China is not party to any agreement other than a bilateral agreement with Russia.”
     
            Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters Wednesday that Tokyo was not notified by Beijing before the launch of the missile, which did not cross Japanese airspace.
     
            The Japan Coast Guard told CNN it was told by China on Monday that “space debris” would fall into three areas – two locations off the Philippine island of Luzon and another in the South Pacific – between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. on Wednesday.
     
            During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union agreed to notify each other of ballistic missile launches extending beyond their territories, and expanded on that in 2000.
     
            In 2009, China and Russia signed an agreement to notify each other of impending ballistic missile launches. The two sides extended the pact by another decade after it expired in 2020.
 
            Under leader Xi Jinping, China has bolstered its nuclear capabilities and revamped the PLA’s Rocket Force, an elite branch overseeing the country’s fast-expanding arsenal of nuclear and ballistic missiles.
     
            In the past few years, satellite photos have shown the construction of what appears to be hundreds of silos for ICBMs in China’s deserts, and the US Defense Department is predicting exponential growth in the number of nuclear warheads in Beijing’s arsenal in the next decade.
     
            China held more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of 2023 and will probably have over 1,000 warheads by 2030, the Pentagon said in its annual report on Beijing’s military last year.
     
            The PLA’s Rocket Force was roiled by a sweeping corruption crackdown last year that saw a string of senior generals purged.
     
            By conducting the high-profile ICBM test, “Beijing may be attempting to show that recent corruption scandals have not diminished the military’s readiness or reach,” said Easley at Ewha University.

            The killing of a Japanese schoolboy in China has sparked an outpouring of anger and soul searching over the rise of extreme nationalism in the country, with some accusing the government of fanning anti-Japan sentiment and even the “education of hatred.”
     
            The tragic loss of a young life has once again thrown a spotlight on the complex relationship between Asia’s two biggest economies, which has been shaped by their wartime history and changing power dynamics brought about by China’s rise.
     
            The 10-year-old, born to a Japanese father and Chinese mother, was fatally stabbed on his way to school by a man in the southern city of Shenzhen last Wednesday. It was the second knife attack on Japanese children and third assault on foreigners in China in recent months.
     
            Authorities in Beijing have refused to disclose the motive in each case, describing them as “isolated incidents” that could happen in any country.
     
            But to some Shenzhen residents and online commentators, the daylight killing in one of China’s most cosmopolitan cities has prompted urgent reflection on the role of nationalistic propaganda and xenophobia in fueling such attacks.
     
            “As a Chinese, I feel heartbroken, outraged and ashamed,” said a Shenzhen resident who laid a white rose outside the Japanese school following the boy’s death last Thursday.
     
            “This kind of violence is the result of long-term education of hatred … There’s no good in instilling hatred from a young age,” said the resident, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals.
     
            The resident’s comments echo a groundswell of commentaries and online posts calling for a reckoning on anti-Japan sentiment, many of which have since been censored by Chinese social media platforms.
     
            “The ‘anti-Japan rhetoric’ based on nationalist narratives has increased to dominate the internet,” a Chinese blogger said in a now-removed viral article on social platform WeChat. “These online remarks … will inevitably spill over from the screen and impact the ‘real world,’” they wrote.
     
            The killing has shaken the Japanese community in China, with some of Japan’s biggest companies offering to repatriate staff members and their families. The development risks undermining Beijing’s recent efforts to court Japanese businesses to expand investment in China, amid a record exodus of foreign capital from the country’s flagging economy.
     
            Japan has long been a target of Chinese nationalist ire, rooted in its brutal invasion and occupation of China in World War II. Generations of Chinese grew up learning about the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in school textbooks and on state television.
     
            That feeling of resentment is further fueled by territorial disputes in the East China Sea and geopolitical tensions, as Beijing seethes at what it sees as Japan’s deepening alliance with the United States intended to contain its rise.
     
            China has ramped up patriotic education under leader Xi Jinping, who frequently evokes the country’s “century of humiliation” by imperial powers to rally public support behind his nationalistic agenda to assert Chinese power on the world stage.

China feels the country isn’t patriotic enough. A new law aims to change that
 
            The fatal stabbing of the Japanese boy coincided with the anniversary of Japan’s invasion of northeast China, an emotionally charged day commemorated with sirens and moments of silence across the country.
     
            The sensitive timing has further fueled speculation that the attack was motivated by hatred.
     
            A rare statement issued last week by dozens of Chinese people living in Japan condemned the assault and called for reflections on the “underlying causes.”
     
            “The extreme nationalist hate education against Japan has been prevalent in China for a long time. It has obscured some Chinese people’s understanding of Japan, and even indulged ignorance and evil,” the statement said.
     
            Signed by intellectuals, professionals, businesspeople and students with their real names, the statement mounted a sharp criticism of Beijing’s policies and vowed to change the “disturbing situation.”
     
            Beijing has denied the accusations.
     
            “There is no so-called Japan-hating education in China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Monday.
     
            “We advocate learning from history, not to perpetuate hatred, but to prevent the tragedy of war from happening again.”
     
            The ruling Chinese Communist Party has long cultivated nationalism to shore up legitimacy.
     
            Under Xi, China’s heavily censored social media has seen a surge of ultra-nationalistic, anti-Japan rhetoric. In some cases, the anger appears to have been fanned by the Chinese government and state media to exert pressure on Tokyo, such as the coordinated outrage last year over Japan’s release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.
     
            In other instances, nationalism is used as clickbait by online influencers, who often peddle jingoistic rhetoric and conspiracy theories to compete for traffic. A Chinese man recently went viral after posting a video of himself defacing the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a controversial symbol of Japan’s military legacy that honors the country’s war dead, including some convicted of war crimes.

Schools egged, businesses harassed: Japan suffers Chinese backlash over Fukushima release
 
            Some of that online hatred has turned to Japanese schools in China’s biggest cities with a large presence of Japanese businesses and workers. Since last year, hundreds of videos fanning hostility and suspicion of these facilities have emerged on Chinese video-streaming sites. Many called for the schools to be shut down, and some even accused them of secretly training Japanese spies.
     
            “(Conspiracies against) Japanese schools have become a cheat code for viral content,” a blogger wrote on WeChat last week, after analyzing nearly 300 clips on video platform Kuaishou, which he said drew more than 2 million upvotes.
     
            Following the article, Kuaishou suspended more than 90 accounts that fanned hostility between China and Japan, the platform said in a statement Saturday.
     
            Some have voiced concerns about the effect of growing online xenophobia on Chinese children.
     
            Zhang, a teaching assistant at a private school in Shanghai, said she noticed children as young as 6 portraying Japanese as villains.
     
            “Little boys in the first grade would call Japanese people (slurs) when they see Japanese flags in their picture books … They also draw battle scenes, in which the enemies are always either Japanese or American,” she told CNN. “We never taught them any of that stuff at school,” Zhang said, adding she suspected the children had picked up the anti-Japan sentiment from TV dramas, online short videos or their families.
     
            On Monday, Japan’s Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa urged Beijing to crack down on online anti-Japan posts and ensure the safety of Japanese citizens in a meeting with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in New York.
     
            “Groundless, malicious and anti-Japanese social media postings and others, including those targeting Japanese schools, directly affect the safety of children and are absolutely unacceptable,” Kamikawa told Wang, demanding a thorough crackdown as soon as possible, the Associated Press reported, citing a statement from the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
     
            Wang, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, vowed to protect the safety of all foreign citizens in China and urged Japan to “remain calm and rational” to avoid “policization and escalation.”
     
            A Japanese mother of two in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said her husband’s automotive company had given families the option to return home, but her family decided to stay.
     
            The mother, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the extreme nationalist rhetoric online did not represent the views of Chinese people she has met during her two years living in China.
     
            “I know so many people who are not against Japan, who love Japan,” she told CNN.
     
            “I’m almost torn in the middle. I’m so sad about the tragedy. But at the same time, I’m also so sad that so many Japanese people are hating China about this one incident.
     
            “One crazy person can do crazy things, doesn’t mean everyone in the country is crazy. I’ve only received love and kindness from the Chinese people I met in Guangzhou.”
     
            She said some of her Chinese friends who live in nearby Shenzhen went to lay flowers at the Japanese school.
     
            By Friday evening, the school had received more than 1,000 bouquets, according to the Japanese consulate in Guangzhou – including from residents of faraway cities.
     
            Some tributes carried a note of apology. “Child, I’m sorry, please rest in peace,” said a note signed from “a mother in Shenzhen.”
     
            “Wish there’s no hatred in heaven,” another reads.

            Beijing says it’s investigating fashion retailer PVH Corp, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, for refusing to source cotton from the Xinjiang region, in a move that could lead to sanctions on an American company with major business interests in China.
     
Tuesday’s announcement from the Commerce Ministry came a day after the Biden administration proposed a possible ban on the sale or import of smart vehicles in the United States that use specific Chinese or Russian technology because of national security concerns.
     
            The ministry said in a statement that New York-based PVH (PVH) is suspected of “violating normal market transaction principles” by boycotting cotton sourced from China’s far western region of Xinjiang. It could be sanctioned by being placed on the country’s so-called “unreliable entities list,” which would bar the firm from doing business in China.
     
            There are currently five American companies on the list, first announced in 2019, none of which do much business in China because they are largely defense manufacturers. Their presence on the list means they’re banned from importing, exporting and investing in China.
     
            In a statement sent to CNN on Wednesday, PVH said it “maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in all countries and regions in which we operate. We are in communication with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and will respond in accordance with the relevant regulations.”
     
            According to the retailer’s supply chain guidelines, it prohibits direct or indirect sourcing from Xinjiang. The US began banning all goods produced in the region in June 2022, following the enactment of a forced labor law signed by President Joe Biden the year before.
     
            According to a 2018 International Religious Freedom Report from the State Department, up to 2 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim-majority ethnic groups have been detained since 2017 in “specially built or converted detention facilities in Xinjiang and subjected … to forced disappearance, torture, physical abuse, and prolonged detention without trial because of their religion and ethnicity.”
     
            China has described the facilities as “vocational training centers,” and claimed in 2019 such centers had been closed. Officials have consistently denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
     
            Being banned by China would deal a big blow to PVH, which, like other global fashion firms, sources extensively in the country. Calvin Klein also has a physical presence in virtually every Chinese province.
     
            It said in its 2023 annual review that “China is an important growth engine, which grew over 20% in local currency for the year.”
     
            “We continue to focus on driving overall brand awareness, especially in China, where both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger are underpenetrated,” it added.
     
            Western apparel brands have faced pressure in China over their position on Xinjiang cotton before. In March 2021, Swedish multinational H&M was pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps. But the backlash ended about a year later and its products were reinstated online.

Helsinki, Finland — Finland will return two giant pandas to China in November, more than eight years ahead of time, as the zoo where they live can no longer afford their upkeep, the chair of the zoo’s board told Reuters on Tuesday.
     
            The pandas, named Lumi and Pyry, were brought to Finland in January 2018, months after Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the Nordic country and signed a joint agreement on protecting the animals.
     
            Since its founding in 1949, the People’s Republic of China has sent pandas to foreign zoos to strengthen trading ties, cement foreign relations and boost its international image.
     
            The Finnish agreement was for a stay of 15 years, but instead the pandas will soon go into a month-long quarantine before they are shipped back to China, according to Ahtari Zoo, the pandas’ current home.
     
            The zoo, a private company, had invested over 8 million euros (about $9 million) in the facility where the animals live and faced annual costs of 1.5 million euros for their upkeep, including a preservation fee paid to China, Ahtari Chair Risto Sivonen said.
     
            The zoo had hoped the pandas would attract visitors to the central Finland location but last year said it had instead accumulated mounting debts as the pandemic curbed travel, and that it was discussing a return.
     
            Rising inflation had added to the costs, the zoo said, and Finland’s government in 2023 rejected pleas for state funding.
     
            In all, negotiations to return the animals had lasted three years, Sivonen said.
     
            “Now we reached a point where the Chinese said it could be done,” Sivonen said.
     
            The return of the pandas was a business decision made by the zoo which did not involve Finland’s government and should not impact relations between the two countries, a spokesperson for Finland’s foreign ministry said.
     
            Despite efforts by China to aid the zoo, the two countries in the end jointly concluded after friendly consultations to return the pandas, the Chinese embassy in Helsinki said in a statement to Reuters.

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            China’s economic slowdown isn’t an abstract concept for Zheng Jiewen, 23, who works full time at an ad agency in the southern megacity of Guangzhou.
     
            Mainly a print model, Zheng used to rake in 30,000 yuan ($4,230) a month when she began working two years ago. But, starting last year, when new business at the company she worked for started to decline, her salary was reduced incrementally, culminating in a major cut in February that slashed her earnings to just half of her previous pay.
     
            “I was extremely shocked,” she told CNN. She said she immediately brought down her spending to match her new salary. That meant no more Louis Vuitton, Chanel or Prada, formerly her go-to brands.
     
            These days, she and her friends are spending their more limited funds on so-called “pingti” products, high-quality replicas of branded goods known in English as dupes. Some are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing, while others are inspired by the original design and offer more colors or textures. The popularity of this product category is soaring as consumer confidence in China nears a historic low, according to analysts.
     
            The “obvious” economic slowdown has resulted in social media searches for dupes tripling from 2022 to 2024, said Laurel Gu, a Shanghai-based director of Mintel, a market research firm.
     
            Gu said that unlike 10 years ago when Chinese shoppers, the world’s top luxury spenders, were clamoring for Western goods from famous brands, consumers are now increasingly turning to more affordable alternatives, a trend that is becoming “the new mainstream.”
     
            Dupes can be considerably cheaper than their branded rivals. A pair of Lululemon’s (LULU) Align yoga pants costs 750 yuan ($106) on its official Chinese website. By contrast, a search of popular e-commerce sites including Tmall yields dozens of other options, often using Lulu in their store names, touting similar leggings for as little as $5 and claiming to be of comparable quality.
     
            China’s growing love for dupes isn’t just a problem for established brands such as Louis Vuitton. Sales at its luxury powerhouse owner, LVMH, dropped 10% in the first six months of this year in its Asia region, which excludes Japan, compared to 2023. That market is dominated by China.
     
            The pingti trend is contributing to overall lackluster consumption and retail sales, which missed what were already-low expectations last month. A slew of economic data over the summer has been so weak that economists are concerned China may miss its  5% target growth rate announced in March.
     
            On Tuesday, China’s central bank unveiled a fresh package of measures to revive growth by cutting its main interest rate and reducing the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve, which would free up money for lending. Stock markets in Hong Kong and mainland China have rallied strongly in response, with the Hang Seng index and the Shanghai Composite each closing 4% higher.
     
            A year and a half after China reopened its borders following the Covid-19 pandemic, consumer confidence is still struggling to recover, economists at investment bank Nomura wrote in a research note earlier this month.
     
            Its consumer confidence index dipped to 86.0 in July from 86.2 in June, they said, only slightly above the historical low of 85.5 hit in November 2022, when the country was still mired in pandemic woes. (The index measures consumer confidence on a scale of zero to 200, with 100 indicating a neutral stance.)

            Shoppers are sitting on the sidelines due to a combination of falling stock prices, capital flight and “tepid” wage growth, the economists said. According to CNN’s interviews with consumers in different parts of China, though, holding on to your existing salary is already considered a win.
     
            An elementary math teacher from Chongqing, southwestern China, who gave her name as Xinxin told CNN that she was previously a loyal fan of Estée Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair serum.
     
            But after a “brutal” pay cut of over 20% this year, which she attributed to “fiscal issues” in her school district caused by economic challenges, she turned to budget-friendly alternatives. She found one with the same key ingredients priced at a massive discount of about 100 yuan (about $14) for 20 milliliters (just over half an ounce), compared to Estée Lauder’s 720 yuan ($100) for 30 milliliters (one ounce).
     
            “Why dupe? Pay cut, of course!” she quipped.
     
            Xinxin and Zheng, the model, consider themselves lucky to have jobs. On Friday, China revealed that the unemployment rate for people aged 18 to 24, excluding students, rose to 18.8% in August. It was the highest level since the figure was reintroduced in January. China stopped releasing the metric for several months after it hit consecutive record highs last summer.
     
            On Tuesday, central bank governor Pan Gongsheng sought to address widespread concern about stalling growth by announcing cuts to one of its key lending rates, the seven-day reverse repo rate, from 1.7% to 1.5%. It also cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks by half a percentage point, which would free up about one trillion yuan ($142 billion) for new lending.

            He additionally revealed cuts to existing mortgages and lowered the minimum mortgage downpayment from 25% to 15% for second-time homebuyers to support the ailing property sector, which many economists believe is the root cause of China’s numerous economic woes.
     
            The real estate sector once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity. It began to cool in 2019 and fell into a deep trough about two years later, after a government-led clampdown on developers’ borrowing.
     
            The resulting crisis has resulted in a precipitous fall in real estate prices and loss of confidence among consumers. Individuals and companies have been trying to preserve their wealth by selling assets and cutting consumption, as well as investment.
     
            Prices of existing homes are down nearly 30% from 2021, Nomura said, citing research from Beike, a platform that tracks housing transactions, based on a sample of 25 large cities.
     
            “Unlike the huge positive wealth effect seen in the US post-Covid, Chinese households have suffered a massive loss of wealth from the housing slump, amounting to an estimated $18 trillion,” Barclays economists wrote in a September 12 research note.
     
            To put that in perspective, they said, it’s as if each three-person household in China has lost around $60,000, an amount that is almost five times China’s per capita gross domestic product.
     
            Nicole Hal, a 33-year-old self-employed businesswoman in Guangzhou, told CNN that her lack of confidence in the country’s economy has led her to slash spending, even though she expects to make at least four million yuan this year ($570,000) together with her husband.
     
            “I’ve stopped buying luxury goods and expensive skin care products, including expensive clothes. I stopped eating out, instead I cook myself at least four days a week,” she said.
     
            That “vicious cycle” of reduced consumption, which has contributed to a slew of pessimistic economic data, has prompted a number of investment banks to cut their estimates for Chinese growth below its official 5% target.
     
            To make up for the shortfall caused by the property sector, Chinese leaders have been largely focused on promoting expansion of manufacturing, including in its electric vehicles (EV) sector. But its strategy of exporting excess capacity to overseas markets has been causing global pushback, especially among EV makers in Europe.
     
            “In China, weak domestic demand and strong manufacturing growth have pushed the goods trade surplus to extremely high levels,” economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a September 13 report, adding that Beijing is likely to face further tariffs from trading partners if it continues to export its surplus.

            A zoo in China has admitted its star attraction, two so-called pandas, are just painted dogs.
     
            The fluffy Chow Chow dogs painted to resemble the country’s beloved national animal were seen in a video shot by a visitor to the zoo in southern Guangdong province.
     
            The video, posted Monday on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, has gone viral, being shared more than 1.4 million times and liked by over 725,000 users.
     
            In a photo shared by another user on social media, the black and white canines can be seen in an enclosure next to a sign that says “painted dogs.”
     
            “We are called Panda Dogs, a pet dog that looks like a panda, dyed and dressed up by Chow Chow. We are gentle, smart, friendly, cute and adorable!” the sign says.
     
            The zoo’s manager, surnamed Huang, said the dogs are one of its top attractions.
     
            “You can see by our name, we are ‘Strange Animals and Cute Pets Paradise,’” she told state-affiliated outlet Sichuan Observation. “These are Chow Chow dogs being painted (as pandas), as this is part of our specialties.”
     
            This is not the first time dogs have been painted to look like pandas or other wild animals in China.
     
            In May, a zoo in eastern Jiangsu province sparked outrage after visitors discovered it painted two dogs black and white to resemble pandas. Following widespread criticism, the zoo admitted the ruse.
     
            A café in the southwestern city of Chengdu also came under fire in 2019 for offering a dyeing service for people to make their pets look like pandas. And in 2016, pet shops in Guangdong were caught selling dogs dyed to look like miniature tigers.

            As a wedding photographer, Tan Mengmeng’s livelihood depends heavily on people getting married, capturing the joy and happiness of a couple’s love.
     
            But China’s marriage rate has been steadily declining and the 28-year-old, who runs a photography studio in central Henan province, has felt the urge to expand her stream of revenue to capitalize off a growing trend: divorce.
     
            In addition to lovers exchanging vows, she now takes photos of couples who want to commemorate, and in many cases celebrate, the end of their marriage.
     
            Official figures show that marriage rates in China are plummeting, declining annually from around 13 million in 2013 to below 7 million in 2022, the lowest since records began in 1985, according to data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics.
     
            The country saw a slight bump last year, up towards 8 million, but authorities remain concerned about the trend.
     
            Meanwhile, the number of divorces has surged, hitting a record high of 4.7 million in 2019, more than four times higher than two decades ago, according to the data.
     
            The government has tried to reverse the rise, imposing a new law in 2021 requiring couples to go through a 30-day “cooling off” period before splitting. It led to a temporary decline, but the number of divorces has since jumped again, up 25% percent in 2023 from the year prior, data showed.
     
            The two shifts have contributed to a deepening demographic crisis facing the world’s second-biggest economy, exacerbated by a slowing economy, a rapidly aging population and the fact that fewer women are having children after the decades-long one-child policy.
     
            Tan says she pivoted her photography services to divorcees after seeing the long queues outside government offices that handle separation.
     
            Since last year, Tan has photographed some 30 couples, capturing moments of heartbreak and joy as they sever marital ties.
     
            “This is a good business. After all, joy and sorrow are both worth recording,” Tan said.
     
            Her foray into China’s budding divorce economy reveals a lot about the country’s changing attitude towards marriage.
     
            While divorce used to draw stigma in Chinese society, which has always placed great emphasis on family unity and stability, many young people are now choosing not to get married. For those who do choose to wed, there is greater acceptance if the marriage doesn’t work out.
     
            The cultural shift has spawned a booming business in divorce photography not only for Tan, but also for other photographers hoping to profit.
     
            Photos shared on Chinese social media Xiaohongshu show some couples signing their divorce papers, while others pose with their divorce certificate.
     
            “29 years old. Happy divorce,” one user wrote alongside a photo of her marriage and divorce certificates side by side.
     
            Companies also now offer services to get rid of a divorcee’s old wedding mementos and any other unwanted mementos in a ceremonial way.
     
            Peng Xiujian, senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia, says the changing times reflect a younger generation prioritizing personal freedom and career development.
     
            “The idea of staying in an unhappy marriage ‘for the sake of appearances’ or out of obligation is losing its grip,” she said.
     
            Peng, who studies demographic trends in China, also attributed the decline in marriages to both economic and social factors, including the high-pressure work environment, a competitive labor market and the high cost of living.
     
            For those choosing divorce, it’s no longer seen as shameful, Tan says.
     
            “It is not shameful to be brave enough to divorce,” Tan said. “Both parties still have feelings…and want to commemorate the relationship.”
     
            One couple who hired Tan chose a restaurant where they had their first date. The couple ordered a few nostalgic dishes, sitting opposite each other motionless. “At the end of the photo shoot, both of them cried,” Tan said.
     
            While they cared for each other, the wife could no longer stand arguments with her in-laws and her husband was too caught up in work to help resolve the conflicts, Tan said.
     
            Some breakups, of course, are less mutual.
     
            Tan said a man once spent the whole photo session fiddling with his phone. The woman started crying.
     
            When the woman got the photos back, she noticed there weren’t many featuring her ex-husband. “I didn’t dare tell her that it was the man who asked me to try not to take photos of his face,” Tan said.
     
            Soon after, Tan found out the man had booked another photographer to take wedding photos with his new partner.
     
            While female clients account for most requests she receives, Tan says she makes sure men also share the costs.
     
            In a factory 60 miles outside of the Chinese capital Beijing, Liu Wei and his team run a business that helps divorced couples destroy the evidence of their marriage.
     
            Faces on old wedding photos are spray-painted, to ensure privacy is respected, before being tossed into a crusher along with other tokens of memories.
     
            For those desperately seeking closure and to move on, the entire process is filmed.
     
            Liu said he sometimes feels like a doctor, having to navigate through the separations without getting too emotional.
     
            “A divorce might not necessarily be a bad thing. It could be a good thing. So there’s no need to feel sad about it,” Liu told CNN.
     
            His services, which cost between $8 and $28, have been in such high demand that business is thriving, he said. Since his factory opened in 2021, he’s already destroyed wedding photos for around 2,500 couples.
     
            Gary Ng, an economist with French investment bank Natixis, said that while it is hard to predict the size of the market and room for growth, China’s divorce rates rising means “there is bound to be more economic activities surrounding it.”
     
            Tan, the photographer, is already thinking ahead on how to grow her business. Her latest plan involves luring return clients in case fate brings the divorced couples back together.
     
            “I’ll give them an 18% discount if the two people remarry and ask me to take photos,” she said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/climate/nuclear-fusion-clean-energy-china-us/index.html,The US led on nuclear fusion for decades. Now China is in position to win the race,"US companies are worried they’re losing their lead in mastering this near-limitless form of energy, as new fusion companies sprout across China, and Beijing outspends DC.","Sep 19, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Angela Dewan,China,"
            The bustling city of Shanghai marks national celebrations with world-famous light shows, illuminating its skyscrapers with dazzling colors, like beacons of Chinese innovation.
     
            It is here that scientists and engineers work around the clock to pursue the next big thing in global tech, from 6G internet and advanced AI to next-generation robotics. It’s also here, on an unassuming downtown street, a small start-up called Energy Singularity is working on something extraordinary: nuclear fusion energy.
     
            US companies and industry experts are worried America is losing its decades-long lead in the race to master this near-limitless form of clean energy, as new fusion companies sprout across China, and Beijing outspends DC.
     
            Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and other stars, is painstakingly finicky to replicate on Earth. Many countries have achieved fusion reactions, but sustaining them for long enough to use in the real world remains elusive.
     
            Mastering fusion is an enticing prospect that promises wealth and global influence to whichever country tames it first.
     
            The prize of this energy is its sheer efficiency. A controlled fusion reaction releases around four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas, and four times more than fission, the kind of nuclear energy used today. It won’t be developed in time to fight climate change in this crucial decade, but it could be the solution to future warming.
     
            The Chinese government is pouring money into the venture, putting an estimated $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually into fusion, according to Jean Paul Allain, who leads the US Energy Department’s Office of Fusion Energy Sciences. In comparison, the Biden administration has spent around $800 million a year.
     
            “To me, what’s more important than the number, it’s actually how fast they’re doing this,” Allain told CNN.
     
            Private businesses in both countries are optimistic, saying they can get fusion power on the grid by the mid-2030s, despite the enormous technical challenges that remain.
     
            The US was among the world’s first to move on the futuristic gambit, working on fusion research in earnest since the early 1950s. China’s foray into fusion came later that decade. More recently, its pace has ratcheted up: Since 2015, China’s fusion patents have surged, and it now has more than any other country, according to industry data published by Nikkei.
 
            Energy Singularity, the start-up in Shanghai, is just one example of China’s warp speed.
     
            It built its own tokamak in the three years since it was established, faster than any comparable reactor has ever been built. A tokamak is a highly complex cylindrical or donut-shaped machine that heats hydrogen to extreme temperatures, forming a soup-like plasma in which the nuclear fusion reaction occurs.
     
            For a fledgling company working on one of the world’s most difficult physics puzzles, Energy Singularity is incredibly optimistic. It has reason to be: It has received more than $112 million in private investment and it has also achieved a world first — its current tokamak is the only one to have used advanced magnets in a plasma experiment.
     
            Known as high-temperature superconductors, the magnets are stronger than the copper ones used in older tokamaks. According to MIT scientists researching the same technology, they allow for smaller tokamaks that can generate as much fusion energy as larger ones, and they can better confine plasma.
     
            The company is planning to build a second-generation tokamak to prove its methods are commercially viable by 2027, and it expects a third-gen device that can feed power to the grid before 2035, the company said.
     
            In contrast, the tokamaks in the US are aging, said Andrew Holland, CEO of the Washington, DC-based Fusion Industry Association. As a result, the US relies on its allies’ machines in Japan, Europe and the UK to further its research.
     
            Holland pointed to a new $570 million fusion research park in eastern China under construction, called CRAFT, on track to be completed next year.
 
            “We don’t have anything like that,” he told CNN. “The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has been upgrading its tokamak for 10 years now. The other operating tokamak in the United States, the DIII-D, is a 30-year-old machine. There’s no modern fusion facilities at American national labs.”
     
            There’s a growing unease in the US industry that China is beating America at its own game. Some of the next-generation tokamaks China has built, or plans to, are essentially “copies” of US designs and use components that resemble those made in America, Holland said.
     
            China’s state-funded BEST tokamak, which is expected to be completed in 2027, is a copy of one designed by Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Holland said, a company in Massachusetts working with MIT. The two designs feature the same kind of advanced magnets Energy Singularity is using.
     
            Another machine being built by a private Chinese company looks very similar to one designed by the US company Helion, Holland said.
     
            There is “a long history” of China copying American tech, he added.›
     
            “They’re fast followers and then take the lead by dominating the supply chain,” Holland said, using solar panel technology as an example. “We’re aware of this and want to make sure that’s not the way it goes forward.”
     
            CNN did not receive a reply from China’s National Energy Administration when asked whether state-funded fusion research had copied or been inspired by US designs.
     
            Nuclear fusion is a highly complex process that involves forcing together two nuclei that would normally repel. One way to do that is to turn up temperatures in a tokamak to the tune of 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times that of the sun’s core.
     
            When they bind, the nuclei let off a large amount of energy as heat, which can then be used to turn turbines and generate power.
     
            The US has been a fusion leader for decades; it was the first nation to apply fusion energy in the real world — in a hydrogen bomb.
     
            In the early 1950s, the US military tested a series of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean that were “boosted” by gases that created a fusion reaction, resulting in an explosion 700 times the power of Hiroshima blast.
     
            Sustaining nuclear fusion for long periods is much more challenging, and while China races ahead with its tokamaks, the US is finding an edge in other technology: lasers.
     
            In late 2022, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California shot nearly 200 lasers at a cylinder holding a fuel capsule the size of a peppercorn, in the world’s first successful experiment to generate a net gain of fusion energy. That means more power came out of the process than was used to heat the capsule (though they didn’t count the energy needed to power the lasers).
     
            There are yet more ways to achieve nuclear fusion, and the US is hedging its bets on a variety of technologies.
     
            It’s not impossible that approach could pay off.
     
            “We don’t know exactly which is going to be the best concept, and it may not be one,” said Melanie Windridge, a UK-based plasma physicist and CEO of Fusion Energy Insights, an industry monitoring organization. There may ultimately be several viable approaches for fusion power, she told CNN. “And then it will come down to costs and other factors in the longer term.”
     
            But the tokamak is the best-researched concept, she said.
     
            “Over time, it’s had the most research put into it, so it’s the most advanced in terms of the physics,” said Windridge. “And a lot of the private companies are building on that.”
     
            With the money China is putting into research, the tokamak concept is rapidly evolving. China’s EAST tokamak in Hefei held plasma stable at 70 million degrees Celsius — five times hotter than the core of the sun — for more than 17 minutes, a world record and an objectively astonishing breakthrough.

            Mikhail Maslov of the UK Atomic Energy Authority described it as an “important milestone,” adding that running long plasma pulses remains one of the biggest technical challenges to commercializing fusion energy.
     
            While China’s government pours money into fusion, the US has attracted far more private investment. Globally, the private sector has spent $7 billion on fusion in the last three to four years, about 80% of which has been by US companies, the DOE’s Allain said.
     
            “In the US, what you have is that entrepreneurial spirit of being able to really think outside the box and innovate and really address some of these gaps, not just in science, but also in the technology,” he said.
     
            But if the Chinese government continues to invest more than $1 billion a year, that could soon eclipse US spending, even in the private sector.
     
            And if those investments pay off, colorful celebrations in Shanghai will not only be powered by fusion, they will cast China in a whole new light.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/fbi-chinese-hacking/index.html,FBI says it has disrupted major Chinese hacking operation that threatened US critical infrastructure,The FBI has used a court order to seize control of a network of hundreds of thousands of hacked internet routers and other devices that Chinese government-linked hackers were using to threaten critical infrastructure in the US and ...,"Sep 18, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Sean Lyngaas,China,"
            The FBI has used a court order to seize control of a network of hundreds of thousands of hacked internet routers and other devices that Chinese government-linked hackers were using to threaten critical infrastructure in the US and overseas, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.
     
            “It is just one round in a much longer fight,” Wray said in a speech at the Aspen Cyber Summit in Washington, DC. “The Chinese government is going to continue to target your organizations and our critical infrastructure.”
     
            The massive web of hacked devices — known as a botnet — was a menace that the Chinese hackers could have used to conduct targeted cyberattacks on US companies or government agencies, according to an advisory released by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies (the English-speaking alliance that includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom). As of June, the botnet included over 260,000 hacked devices from all over the world, from North and South America to Australia, according to US officials. Those hacked devices ranged from webcams to DVRs to routers, and about half of them were located in the US, according to Wray.
     
            A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington called the US allegations “groundless” and accused the US government of conducting cyberattacks against China.
     
            It’s the latest tit-for-tat in the often-tense relations between US and China in cyberspace. The US government has long warned that another Chinese government-backed hacking group has been lurking in US transportation and communication networks, waiting to use that access to disrupt any US response to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
     
            That Chinese hacking unit is preparing to “wreak havoc and cause real-world harm” to the US, Wray told Congress in January.
     
            The botnet targeted by the FBI and its allies on Wednesday was an active menace, Wray said in his speech.
     
            The botnet caused “an all-hands-on deck cybersecurity incident” for one unnamed California-based organization, causing “significant financial loss,” the FBI director said.
     
            But Wednesday’s takedown was more about what the botnet could have done than what it did. The army of zombie computers has been a quiet and looming threat to US government networks for many months, according to experts. In late December 2023, the botnet’s operators “conducted extensive scanning efforts” of US military and other government agencies, according to US tech firm Lumen Technologies, which investigated the activity.
     
            Botnets are a tool of choice for both cybercriminals and state-backed hackers because users around the world are often unaware that their computers have been hijacked for scamming or espionage. The FBI said in February that it had helped disrupt a network of over 1,000 hacked internet routers that Russia’s military intelligence agency was allegedly using for cyber espionage operations against the United States and its European allies.
     
            The Chinese botnet targeted on Wednesday had an array of capabilities, including the ability to conducted tailored cyberattacks using the devices it had compromised, according to Lumen researchers.
     
            Lumen researchers are watching for signs that the Chinese hackers will resurrect the botnet. But for now, “we assess that the botnet has been taken offline due to a combination of law enforcement efforts and null routing as of September 18,” Danny Adamitis, principle information security engineer at Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs threat intelligence division, told CNN.
     
            Null routing is a process that internet technology providers can use to stop data from being sent to a specific IP address.
     
            A Chinese company named Integrity Technology Group managed the botnet for the last three years, according to US officials. CNN has requested comment from the company.
     
            The Chinese tech firm is “involved in many of China’s most important programs and efforts to improve its hacking capabilities,” Dakota Cary, a consultant at security firm SentinelOne who focuses on China, told CNN. “The naming of the company is significant as it demonstrates allied governments’ visibility into China’s operations, as well as enabling researchers to further investigate the company.”

            Shanghai was brought to a standstill on Monday by what authorities say was the strongest typhoon to directly hit the Chinese financial hub in more than seven decades, with flights, trains and highways suspended during a national holiday.
     
            Typhoon Bebinca made landfall in an industrial suburb southeast of the metropolis of 25 million people at about 7:30 a.m. local time. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) said it packed top wind speeds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane.
     
            The China Meteorological Administration recorded wind speeds of 151 kph (94 mph) near the typhoon’s eye when it made landfall, and state media described it as the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since 1949.
     
            The administration on Monday issued a red typhoon warning, its most severe alert, warning of gale force winds, heavy rainfall and coastal floods in large swathes of eastern China.
     
            The powerful storm has disrupted travel plans for holidaymakers during the Mid-Autumn festival, or Moon Festival, a three-day national holiday that started on Sunday.
     
            All flights at Shanghai’s two international airports have been canceled since 8 p.m. Sunday. The city also suspended its ferry services, halted some train lines and closed ports, bridges and highways on Monday.
     
            Many tourist destinations in the city, including Shanghai Disney Resort, were also shut on Monday. Videos on Douyin, China’s version of Tiktok, show Disney staff taping trash bins to fences at the park.
     
            More than 414,000 people in Shanghai had been evacuated to safety by midnight Monday, with exhibition centers and school gyms turned into makeshift shelters, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
     
            Similar safety measures were also adopted in the neighboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. Across the region, more than 1,600 flights had been canceled as of Monday afternoon, according to CCTV.
     
            On Chinese social media, some Shanghai residents reported power and water outages on Monday morning. Many had rushed to stock up on food and supplies over the weekend.
     
            The typhoon is expected to quickly weaken into a tropical storm as it moves inland toward the west.
     
            Bebinca is the second major storm to hit China this month, following deadly Super Typhoon Yagi, the world’s second most powerful tropical cyclone so far this year.
     
            Yagi killed four people in the southern province of Hainan after making landfall on September 6 with maximum sustained wind speeds of 230 kph (140 mph), the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, before wreaking devastation across parts of Southeast Asia.
     
            Scientists have found that hotter oceans caused by the human-caused climate crisis are leading storms to intensify more rapidly.
     
            Shanghai is generally not in the direct path of strong typhoons, which typically make landfall further south in China. Prior to Bebinca, the city had only been directly hit by two typhoons – in 1949 and 2022 – plus a handful of severe tropical storms, according to data from the China Meteorological Administration.

            The Biden administration said Friday that it has finalized tariff hikes on certain Chinese-made products that the president first announced in May.
     
            The tariff rate will go up to 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% on solar cells and to 25% on electrical vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes beginning September 27, according to the US Trade Representative’s Office.
     
            Tariff hikes on other products, including semiconductor chips, are set to take effect over the next two years.

            The administration’s increases – which impact a relatively small amount of US imports – come as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have clashed over tariffs on the campaign trail. Trump is calling for sweeping new duties on all imports, while Harris has said that his proposal would raise prices on American households.
     
            Trump implemented sweeping tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made products when he was in office. President Joe Biden has kept those tariffs in place and, after the USTR finished a multiyear review earlier this year, decided to increase some of the rates on about $15 billion of Chinese imports.
     
            The products that will now face increases are in line with Biden’s other economic policies aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing in industries including clean energy and semiconductor chips.
     
            “Today’s finalized tariff increases will target the harmful policies and practices of the People’s Republic of China that continue to impact American workers and businesses,” US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a press release.
     
            China is expected to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US-made goods.
     
            Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters in May that China opposes “the unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.”
     
            Also on Friday, the Biden administration announced a new effort to limit the amount of foreign goods that can come into the US tariff-free because they are valued at $800 or less.
     
            The majority of shipments using this exemption, known as “de minimis,” are coming from China, the White House said. The administration’s change to the trade regulation will make some imports ineligible for the exemption. It will take effect after a public comment period.
     
            Tariffs can be politically popular, even though many economists agree they are costly tools that don’t always boost domestic industries as promised.
     
            They are meant to raise prices of foreign-made goods as a way of protecting domestic producers. Many Democrats and Republicans agree that Beijing has long used unfair trading practices to make Chinese-made goods more competitive.
     
            Still, there are major differences to note between Trump’s call for sweeping tariffs and the Biden administration’s more targeted approach.
     
            If elected, Trump has said he will significantly increase the tariffs the US has on imports from all over the world. He’s called for new tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US. For context, the US imported $3.2 trillion worth of goods in 2022, per the latest data available.
     
            Trump has also called for adding another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports and said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar.

Fact check: Trump and Vance keep falsely describing how tariffs work
 
            Trump has said that the revenue brought in by these new tariffs, which is paid by importers in the US, could be used to lower taxes and pay for child care.
     
            Harris, who hasn’t given many details about how she would use – or not use – tariffs, has repeatedly attacked Trump’s proposal, calling it a “Trump sales tax.”
     
            She has pointed to a study that shows Trump’s proposed tariffs would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank.
     
            Other studies have also said the proposed tariffs would raise prices for families, but by a smaller amount. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, for example, said the impact could be an additional $1,350 a year for middle-income households.
     
Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
     
            Once an importer pays for the tariff, it usually passes along some or all of the cost to the consumer.
     
            But when it comes to the new tariff hike – from 27.5% to 100% – on electric vehicles, American consumers may not see a sudden jump in prices. That’s because the US already imports a relatively small amount of electric vehicles from China.
     
            Since 2018, Chinese electric vehicle imports have increased from $7.2 million to $388.8 million – but were only 2% of all US electric vehicle imports, according to the US International Trade Commission.
     
            Still, US automakers fear Chinese-made electric vehicles, which are sold for as little as $10,000, could end up flooding the US market.
     
            “China now produces 70 percent of the world’s electric cars – jeopardizing productive investments elsewhere,” USTR wrote in its recent report.
     
            Steel and aluminum trade groups and unions also welcomed the news after Biden first said in April he was considering a tariff hike on steel during a speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh. But some analysts say the move could have little impact on the US steel industry because China accounts for a very small percentage of US steel imports.

            Chinese regulators have hit PwC’s auditing unit in mainland China with a six-month business suspension and a record fine of 441 million yuan ($62 million) over the firm’s audit of troubled property developer China Evergrande Group.
     
            Delivering a strong rebuke to the Big Four firm, China’s securities regulator said Friday that its investigation found that PwC Zhong Tian LLP helped cover up and “even condone” Evergrande’s fraud while auditing the annual results of the developer’s onshore flagship unit — Hengda Real Estate — in 2019 and 2020.
     
            “PwC has seriously eroded the basis of law and good faith, and damaged investors’ interest,” said the China Securities Regulatory Commission in a statement.
     
            Chinese authorities have been examining PwC’s role in the accounting of Hengda Real Estate since the CSRC accused the developer in March of a $78-billion fraud over a period of two years through 2020.
     
            The business suspension and fines are the toughest ever penalty received by a Big Four accounting firm in China and come against the backdrop of an exodus of clientele and layoffs at the firm in recent months.
     
            The move is set to cloud PwC’s prospects in the world’s no. 2 economy. PwC Zhong Tian, the registered accounting entity and the main onshore arm of PwC in China, was the country’s top-earning auditor in 2022, according to the latest official data.
     
            “We are disappointed by PwC Zhong Tian’s audit work of Hengda, which fell unacceptably below the standards we expect of member firms of the PwC network,” PwC network, the alliance of PwC’s global member units, said in a statement.
     
            The firm said that, as part of its “accountability and remedial actions,” PwC China’s territory senior partner Daniel Li had stepped down and Hemione Hudson, the firm’s global risk and regulatory leader, had taken over from him.
     
            The six-month business suspension was imposed by China’s Ministry of Finance. The ministry also imposed a fine of 116 million yuan ($16 million) on PwC Zhong Tian for its auditing failure of Hengda in 2018, according to an MOF statement.

            The CSRC said in a separate statement that it had confiscated PwC Zhong Tian’s revenue involved in the Evergrande case totalling 27.7 million yuan and fined the unit 297 million yuan.
     
            “PwC has, to a certain extent, covered up and even condoned Evergrande’s financial fraud and fraudulent issuance of corporate bonds,” said the CSRC statement.
     
            “It (PwC) has to be severely punished according to law.”
     
            Over the past few months, a growing number of Chinese clients, mainly state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, has been leaving PwC, following the launch of the regulatory investigation into the firm.
     
            The firm had about 400 Chinese clients, listed at home or in offshore markets such as Hong Kong or New York, in March this year, including tech behemoths Alibaba and Tencent.
     
            A Reuters calculation based on filings showed more than 50 Chinese firms, including PwC’s largest mainland China-listed client Bank of China, have either dropped PwC as their auditor or canceled their plans to hire it.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/china/china-raises-retirement-age-intl-hnk/index.html,"For decades, Chinese workers have retired relatively early. That’s about to change","For decades, Chinese workers have wrapped up their working lives at relatively young ages: 60 for men and as early as 50 for women.","Sep 13, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
            For decades, Chinese workers have wrapped up their working lives at relatively young ages: 60 for men and as early as 50 for women.
     
            But all that is about to change as the Chinese government passed new legislation on Friday laying out a plan to delay the retirement age over the course of 15 years, starting January 1, according to state news agency Xinhua.
     
            Existing rules stated that men in urban areas could retire at 60 and receive their pensions, and women at 50 or 55, depending on their occupation. The new rules gradually push back the age to 63 for men, and to 55 and 58, respectively, for women.
     
            The measures, which were approved by the country’s top lawmaking body following signaling from a key Communist Party body in July, also lay out plans to extend the minimum working period for employees to receive a monthly pension from 15 to 20 years, with changes starting from 2030.
     
            They also include some flexibility in retirement age, especially for those who have already completed the minimum working period.
     
            The change, which the government has been considering for about a decade, comes as China’s economy slows while Beijing grapples with the looming consequences of a rapidly aging population and a pension funding crisis.
     
            The announcement sparked immediate widespread discussion – and backlash – across Chinese social media.
     
            Some social media users appeared encouraged that the changes weren’t more drastic and included some flexibility. One comment on the X-like social media platform Weibo that garnered thousands of likes said: “As long as there are options to retire or not based on our will, I have no objections.”
     
            Others voiced discontent over the prospect of delayed access to their pension and years of extra work, as well as concern about whether the policy would strain China’s already tough job market, where unemployment levels among young people remain stubbornly high.
     
            “Delayed retirements just means you can’t get your pension until you hit 63, but it doesn’t mean everyone will have a job until then!” wrote one user.
     
            Chinese state media in recent days has hailed the anticipated changes as an urgent and necessary reform for an outmoded system, highlighting how the existing policy had been in place since the 1950s when life expectancies and education levels were both lower.

            “The current retirement policy framework has remained unchanged for 73 years. Especially since the reform and opening up (starting around 1978), the demographic, economic and social landscape has transformed dramatically,” demographer Yuan Xin was quoted by state media as saying earlier this week.
     
            The existing retirement age is seriously mismatched with the current “national realities” and the new normal of future economic and social development, said Yuan, who is deputy head of the China Population Association and a demographer at Nankai University in Tianjin.
     
            China’s existing retirement ages are lower than those in a number of major economies. The 2022 average standard retirement ages across Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries stood at 63.6 years old for women and 64.4 years old for men.
     
            Other countries have also grappled with how to manage the retirement age. Major protests erupted in France in 2023 in response to a government attempt to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The US has also been debating retirement reform and gradually increasing the retirement age, with Social Security incentives in place for retirees who delay taking benefits until age 70.
     
            The changes come as China’s leadership has become increasingly concerned by the country’s demographic challenges, which some economists warn could see the still-developing country fall into the trap of “getting old before it gets rich.”
     
            China’s population has shrunk for the past two years, and in 2023 it recorded its lowest birth rate since the founding of Communist China in 1949, despite a reversal of the country’s long-standing “one-child policy” from 2016 and government-led efforts to incentivize more young couples to have children.
     
            China’s elderly now account for more than 20% of the population, according to a report earlier this month from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which said about 297 million were aged 60 and above by the end of last year.
     
            Demographers cited in state media have said that, between 2030 and 2035, the elderly population will make up 30% of the total population. That is likely to increase to more than 40% of the population by the middle of this century – making China a “super-aged society.”

China’s population declines for second straight year as economy stumbles
 
            Those projections have seen the government ramping up efforts to expand elderly care services and boost private-sector efforts to build a “silver economy.”
     
            It’s also put heightened focus on the ability of the country’s pension system to handle a shrinking workforce alongside its burgeoning elderly population.
     
            A 2019 report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, forecast that China’s state pension fund would run dry by 2035 because of its dwindling workforce. Years of strict pandemic-related restrictions, which have shrunk the coffers of local governments, could make the pension shortfall even more pronounced.
     
            Early last year, thousands of elderly people protested in several major cities against big cuts to their medical benefits payments, fearing that local governments were dipping into their individual accounts to cover the shortages in the state pension fund.
     
            Even for those of working age, employment remains a steep challenge following the pandemic and a raft of government-led industry crackdowns in recent years. In July, the youth unemployment rate hit 17.1% among those aged between 16 and 24 who are not students, and was 6.5% for those 25 to 29 that month, according to state media.
     
            Employers continue to pull back on hiring as the economy slows and people, especially in tech sectors, have widely noted age discrimination in hiring for those over 35.
     
            The new regulations also call on the state to “support young people’s employment and entrepreneurship, strengthen the development of employment positions for older workers … and strengthen the prevention and governance of employment age discrimination.”

            A Chinese “reusable experimental spacecraft” believed to be the country’s secretive space plane has landed back on Earth after more than eight months in orbit – the latest development in a largely covert race between the United States and China to hone such technology.
     
            China’s spacecraft blasted into orbit last December – two weeks ahead of the latest launch of the US military’s own Boeing X-37B uncrewed space plane – on the third known orbital mission of such a Chinese spacecraft.
     
            Some 268 days later, the spacecraft returned to an unnamed landing site, according to a brief September 6 announcement from state news agency Xinhua, which declared its test mission a “complete success.”
     
            China’s development of the vehicle, about which little is publicly known, comes after recent years of striving to catch up to the US, long the world’s preeminent space power, for dominance in orbit and beyond.
     
            Here’s what we know – and don’t – about China’s space plane.
     
            The term “space plane” often evokes NASA’s Space Shuttle, which flew 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, carrying astronauts into orbit and helping to construct the International Space Station. It might also recall the Soviet Union’s ill-fated Buran space shuttle, which completed one successful uncrewed flight in 1988 before being discontinued.
     
            But the newer planes currently being tested in orbit by the US and China are believed to be smaller than the shuttle and uncrewed. The US X-37B is operated by the military, while China has not said whether the program believed to be linked to its recently landed spacecraft is civilian or military.
     
            Space planes are generally reusable craft similar to both an airplane and a spacecraft in that they can fly in Earth’s atmosphere and in space. Both the Chinese spacecraft that recently returned to Earth and the US’ X-37B, which has conducted seven missions since its 2010 debut, are launched on rockets into outer space but land like airplanes on runways, experts say.
     
            Space planes are valued for their potential to carry out a range of missions in orbit and help countries respond quickly to developments in space, while advancing reusable spacecraft technology that could be used for more regular human space travel in the future.
     
            “It’s no surprise that the Chinese are extremely interested in our space plane, and we’re extremely interested in theirs,” US Space Force chief of operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told reporters at a conference in December.
     
            “It is a capability – the ability to put something in orbit, do some things, and bring it home and take a look at the results is powerful.”
     
            Not too much.
     
            China has never said what specific technologies the spacecraft has tested, or released any photographs of it, since it began operating in orbit in 2020.
     
            A video shared on the social media channel of state-backed space contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation announcing the spacecraft’s September 6 landing featured a banner instead of images. The text read: “It’s too advanced to be shown.”
     
            Even the name of the spacecraft that landed back on Earth has not been confirmed by the Chinese government, though observers suspect it is the “Shenlong” space plane, which has been under development for two decades.

America’s military has the edge in space. China and Russia are in a counterspace race to disrupt it
 
            Other space plane projects under development in recent years in China have been publicly and officially described as civilian projects, while the official purpose of Shenlong remains unconfirmed, experts say.
     
            It’s also unknown if this is the same vehicle or another in the same series that completed two previous missions – the first in 2020 lasted two days and the second beginning in 2022 lasted 273. All are believed by analysts to have ended with landings at the secretive Lop Nur military facility in Xinjiang, in the country’s far northwest.
     
            An official announcement after its December 14 launch said the spacecraft would “carry out reusable technology verification and space science experiments as planned, providing technical support for the peaceful use of space.”
     
            But space observers are able – via open-source data, imaging and positional measurements – to monitor what the vehicle has been up to in space, including tracking the release of what they say is a suspected “sub-satellite” in late May and its apparent efforts to maneuver around the object. That follows similar exercises on previous tests missions.
     
            “This capability to maneuver close to another object could be used for inspection of space assets, or potentially the clearing of orbits of space debris. But they could be used for nefarious purposes, including interception of signals or the physical damaging of other spacecraft,” said Juliana Suess, a research fellow for space security at London-based defense think tank the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI.
     
            China’s space plane development comes as a growing number of countries are paying attention to the deepening connections between security on Earth and in space – and vying for so-called counterspace technologies with the potential to disrupt or even destroy adversaries’ assets in space.
     
            China has been explicit in recent announcements about the peaceful purposes of the spacecraft and its other endeavors in space, though analysts say it is among world powers developing counterspace capabilities.
     
            The state media announcement of the spacecraft’s landing said it would “pave the way for more convenient and affordable round-trip methods for the peaceful use of space in the future.”
     
            Analysts say there’s no evidence that China’s space plane is being designed to act as a counterspace weapon, but that information and capabilities gained on its missions could have dual-use applications.
     
            “Anything that China learns from operating its space plane, no matter its main purpose, will benefit its counterspace efforts,” said Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington.
     
            “In addition to maturing space technologies, it’s allowing China to mature its muscle memory for operating in space. It’s concerning how China could apply those learnings to counterspace weapons,” he said.
     
            It’s hard to compare China’s space plane with the US’ X-37B, due to the high level of secrecy around both programs.
     
            The X-37B has been in operation for years longer than China’s space plane and has stayed in orbit significantly longer, a record set during its sixth mission of a 908-day journey before returning to Earth in November 2022.
     
            The US Space Force, which oversees the X-37B, describes it as a reusable, uncrewed spacecraft that “strengthens the United States’ future in space by conducting technology experiments that expedite the development of next-generation capabilities.”
     
            Its latest mission includes tests operating in new regions of orbit, experimenting with space domain awareness technologies to monitor objects in space, and investigating radiation effects on NASA materials, including plant seeds, the force has said.

            But observers have also raised questions about the activities of the space plane, including its own deployment of multiple small satellites.
     
            The level of secrecy around the deployment of those satellites “may indicate they are part of a covert intelligence program, but it may also indicate the testing of offensive technologies or capabilities,” the independent US-based Secure World Foundation noted in a recent report, while pointing to “similar behavior in terms of secret deployments” from the Shenlong space plane.
     
            Observers also note that China is likely using the US program as a benchmark for its own.
     
            “The fact they now have a reusable spacecraft just by itself shows how far they have come (and) the fact it was up for so long, and returned safely,” said Brendan Mulvaney, director of the China Aerospace Studies Institute, a US Air Force think tank, noting the Chinese claim of mission success earlier this month.
     
            “All of that means they are putting in the time, effort, and investments, to make it work.  China is the undisputed No. 2 space power and is aiming to close the gap with the US in military, commercial, and scientific realms, all at the same time,” he said.

            Married for seven years, Hansen and his wife Momo care for six little ones at their apartment in downtown Beijing.
     
            But they adopt a slightly different parenting routine from your typical mom and dad: They play fetch with them and take them out for daily walks.
     
            These little ones are not their offspring, but “fur babies,” or “mao hai zi,” in Chinese, and the couple loves them so much they refer to them as “our daughters, our sons.”
     
            “They are all part of our family. We are one big family,” said Momo, who gave only her nickname for fear that she may get into trouble with authorities for openly speaking about her choice of lifestyle – one that is at odds with China’s effort to boost birth rates.
     
China is grappling with a fast-aging population and shrinking labor force after decades of enforcing a one-child policy. The country is also one of the most expensive places in the world to raise a child in relative terms, easily beating Australia and France, according to a study from the Beijing-based YuWa Population Research Institute earlier this year.
     
            After ending the one-child policy in 2016 and making yet another major birth policy shift in 2021, the government now wants couples to have three children. But Beijing hasn’t been as successful in driving up births as it was in deterring them.
     
            Many Chinese couples like Hansen, 36, and Momo, 35, are not sold on children. Instead, they’ve become pet parents.
     
            By the end of the year, the number of pets in China’s cities is expected to surpass the number of children aged four and under, according to a July research report by investment bank Goldman Sachs that examined rising demand for pet food.
     
            By 2030, the number of pets in urban China alone will almost double the number of young children across the country, according to its projection. The country’s pet ownership rate would be even higher if the number of dogs and cats in rural areas were included.
     
            The Goldman Sachs estimates reflect the changing values of a generation that no longer subscribes to the traditional thinking that marriage is about giving birth and passing on the family lineage.
     
            “Different generations value things differently, you know,” said Hansen, who also only gave his nickname.
     
            In predicting a surge in sales for dog and cat food, Goldman Sachs revealed a trend that’s been giving Chinese officials a big headache.
     
            The country’s population declined for the first time in decades in 2022 in what analysts said was its first drop since the 1961 famine triggered by former leader Mao Zedong’s disastrous plan, the Great Leap Forward. A year later, China was surpassed by India as the world’s most populous country.
     
            Goldman found pet food to be one of the fastest growing consumer sectors in China, which is expanding despite otherwise anemic spending. Sales grew an average of 16% each year between 2017 and 2023, creating a $7 billion industry. The industry’s value is expected to surge to $12 billion in 2030, the report added. At its most optimistic, pet food could become a $15 billion industry in China in six years.
     
            It’s a far cry from just two decades ago, when pet ownership was still considered a bourgeois concept and people kept mixed breeds as guard dogs.
     
            And even now, pet ownership remains comparatively low, according to Goldman Sachs. Last year, the percentage of dog-keeping households in Chinese cities stood at 5.6%, significantly lower than its neighbors and giving it room to grow, it said. Japan reached 17.5% in 2009, according to the report.
     
            Its predictions for babies were less rosy. The report projected the number of new births in China to contract at an average annual rate of 4.2% between 2022 and 2030 because of a decline of women in the 20 to 35 age group, as well as young people’s reluctance to have children.
     
            “We expect to see stronger momentum in pet ownership amid a relatively weaker birth rate outlook and higher incremental household pet penetration from the younger generation,” the report added.
     
            Many couples find it tough to face the ballooning cost of raising children in uncertain economic times. The world’s second biggest economy is facing headwinds ranging from high youth unemployment to a protracted property crisis.
     
            Authorities are now offering a slew of incentives, from cash to more parental leave, to promote parenthood – in a complete reversal of previous measures to stem overpopulation, which included forced abortion and sterilization.
     
            But, like many of its East Asian neighbors, the new benefits aren’t having much of an effect.
     
            China’s population plunged to 1.409 billion last year, shrinking two years in a row. Its birth rate also dipped to 6.39 births per 1,000 people, the lowest rate since the founding of Communist China in 1949.
     
            Tao, 38, runs Space, a dog lodge in Beijing. For her, the preference for pets means good business.
     
            With China’s national day holiday fast approaching, dog owners are scrambling to find someone to look after their canines during the peak travel season that begins on October 1.
     
            “We were almost fully booked for that holiday,” she said.
     
            Tao, who gave also only her nickname, has two dogs and no kids. Her family used to pressure her to have kids, she said, but she knew that was not the life she wanted.
     
            “I enjoy my lifestyle. My partner and I will travel a lot. I like to go see the world. So, the idea of having kids just wasn’t attractive enough for me,” she said.
     
            She felt the mentality of the younger generation had changed. “I feel like people start to be more like, ‘This is what I want,’ or ‘This is what I like for my life,’ rather than like, ‘This is what the society taught me to do,’ or ‘This is what my parents want me to do,’ ” Tao added.
     
            Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor of social science and public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said children and pets aren’t mutually exclusive in China.
     
            But young couples are facing mounting challenges from unemployment to social pressure, such as long work hours and the expectation that some women will give up their careers after giving birth, he said.

            “If you’re a 20-something in China and you feel the strong need to nurture, it is much easier to get a puppy, kitten or rabbit than find a partner to get married and give birth to children with,” Gietel-Basten said.
     
            For Hansen and Momo, they simply enjoy the company of their fur babies.
     
            “We’re not following any trend. We’re not affected by them. It’s just our own choice. I think it’s just that we love dogs,” Hansen said.
     
            He said he looked forward to coming home every day because his dogs are so excited to see him.
     
            “This cures everything,” he said.
     
            At a women’s conference last year, China’s leader Xi Jinping lectured delegates about fostering a new type of marriage and childbearing culture. The message was clear for Chinese women: Get married and have babies.
     
            But Momo says the country should “make do” without her genes.
     
            “I feel that (China) does not lack this one kid from me,” she said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/travel/china-travel-tips-visas-mobile-payments-intl-hnk/index.html,Planning a trip to China can be confusing. Here are the issues tripping up many foreign tourists,China has been amping up efforts to lure international tourists by introducing more welcoming policies. Here’s what travelers planning a journey to this vast nation need to know.,"Sep 11, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Maggie Hiufu Wong,China,"
            Traveling to China as a foreigner isn’t the simplest affair.
     
            Visa applications can be complicated, while international flights are limited and more expensive right now due to lower demand and higher costs for many airlines to fly around Russian airspace.
     
            And once you manage to wade through all of that, navigating this highly automated society with its own digital ecosystem can be intimidating – particularly for first-time visitors.
     
            But things may be changing.
     
            China has been amping up efforts to lure international travelers since reopening its doors following the pandemic at the end of 2022 by introducing more welcoming policies – and it’s asked the private sector to help, too.
     
            The country now offers visa exemptions for dozens of nationalities, as well as a 144-hour visa-free transit policy at a growing number of ports of entry.

            Meanwhile, mobile wallet giants like Alipay and WeChat have made their apps and payment processes more foreigner-friendly by simplifying their lengthy set-up processes and accepting international credit cards.
     
            Hotels and attractions are also being asked to accept international credit cards, which aren’t popular among merchants in China. Some cities like Beijing have launched all-in-one passes that allow travelers to electronically pay for things like attraction admissions and public transit.
     
            Looking at the stats alone, these measures seem to be working.
     
            China welcomed about 14 million foreign visitors in the first half of 2024, a 152.7% increase from 2023, according to the country’s National Immigration Administration. Around half of those travelers entered the country under various types of visa-free policies.
     
            The number is still a long way off from 2019 figures, when some 98 million foreign visitors traveled to the country, but some in the industry are encouraged by the upward trend.
     
            “Thanks to the new 15-day visa-free policy for some countries, we have seen an increase of tourists from those countries in the last year or so,” says Denny Tian, a travel specialist and manager at The China Guide, a Beijing-based private-tour travel agency.
     
            Gabriela Correia, 25, a doctor from Portugal, visited Shanghai and Beijing in June this year with her American boyfriend, entering the country under the 144-hour visa-free transit policy. It allows travelers from 54 countries (including Portugal and the US) on their way to a third country to make a stopover in one of several designated Chinese regions for up to six days.
     
            “It is important to note that planning a trip to China comes with more challenges than most places in the world,” says Correia, who has visited 47 countries so far.
     
            “The amount of information you find online is limited due to the relatively small number of Westerners going to China and because Google Maps is restricted in China.”
     
            Travel specialist Tian tells CNN Travel the language barrier has long been a big challenge for international travelers.
     
            “Many places only have Chinese information,” he says. “Most of the service staff do not speak English.”
     
            But he says there are ways to overcome these difficulties like downloading a translator app. Meanwhile, some airports have been making an extra effort by hiring multilingual staff to welcome visitors in different languages.
     
            “Not knowing Chinese definitely came with its challenges but I would say that made this trip even more fun,” says Correira.
     
            “People are very welcoming and make an effort to make it work. We had a lovely experience in a tea specialty restaurant even though none of the workers could speak English. We used the Google Translate photo feature to translate the menu and made it work out. We ended up getting cheesecake while we thought we were getting cheese bread for starters but who doesn’t like to have an extra dessert?”
     
            The doctor says she used a travel SIM card that came with a virtual private network (VPN) to access her usual mobile apps such as Google Translate. (More on this in the Q&A section below.)
     
            Correira also notes that many restaurants ask diners to order through a QR code that is linked to Alipay, which now has a translation function incorporated into the app, allowing foreign visitors to know what’s on the menu.
     
            Although the couple managed to have a great time traveling independently without knowing Chinese, they decided to hire a private guide for their visit to the Great Wall “as it facilitates logistics and allows you to go to (lesser-traveled) sections of the Wall.”
     
            The couple was most impressed by the “diverse and rich culinary traditions,” the contrasting futuristic and historical colonial architecture along the waterfront of Shanghai as well as the views and a toboggan ride at Mutianyu Great Wall in Beijing.
     
            Correira says that the trip has changed some of her perceptions about China and she is already planning their next trip.
     
            “I would say right now Zhangjiajie National Forest Park is at the top of my list in my next visit to China,” she says, referring to a national park in Hunan province that is said to have inspired the landscapes in the movie “Avatar.”
     
            Planning your own dream trip to this vast nation? We’ve put together a guide to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding China travel.
     
            Here’s where things get really confusing. There have been a lot of announcements and changes in recent months, and we will try to cover the most notable.
     
            China has mutual visa exemption agreements with 23 countries – including Singapore and Thailand – and a new unilateral visa-free policy for 15 additional passports.
     
            The 15 countries now enjoying visa exemptions until December 31, 2025 are Austria, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Switzerland.
     
            Citizens of these countries can visit China for no more than 15 days continuously without a visa.

            Given how quickly things change in the diplomatic world, it’s wise to visit the China Visa Application Service Center or your country’s foreign affairs website to find out the latest on entry agreements before booking your trip.
     
            If your country isn’t on the visa-free list or you don’t want to visit China on a stopover (more on that below), you will need to apply for a tourist visa.
     
            On that front, there’s good news for Americans. China tourist visa application processes have been easier for US citizens since January 2024; applicants are no longer required to submit proof of a round-trip air ticket, hotel reservation, itinerary or invitation letter. (The Chinese consulate general in New York has put together a list of documents you now need to apply for a tourist visa on its website.)
     
            Citizens of other countries in need of a tourist visa can head to China Online Visa Application to find their nearest processing center and fill in the online application form.
     
            China’s two visa-free transit policies allow travelers from certain countries to enter China for up to three or six days – but only if they’re transiting to a third destination, outside of China, afterward.
     
            Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the 54 countries eligible to transit via China for up to six days.
     
            In both cases, travelers need to present purchased travel documents – i.e. connecting tickets for flights, trains and ships – as proof of their next stop (one that is different from the travelers’ original departure country) before entering China. (Hong Kong and Macao are considered a third destination under these policies.)

            However, travelers visiting under these visa-free transit programs have more restrictions in terms of places they can visit.
     
            They can only travel within the 41 designated ports of entry in 19 Chinese provinces – including Beijing and Shanghai.
     
            That means that if you land in Shanghai, then you can only stay within the city and its neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. Exploring the country via China’s vast high-speed railway network is not an option for those entering under the two transit visa schemes.
     
            Correira says she and her boyfriend ended up making a trip to another part of Asia in between their visits to Shanghai and Beijing so they could get two visa-free transit permits for each visit. (The Shanghai government has put together a great explainer about the visa-free transit policy here.)
     
            Travelers aren’t required to join a guided tour or a group tour for most parts of China if they have the appropriate visa or if their passports qualify them for the visa-free exemption policy – with a major exception being the Tibet Autonomous Region.
     
            International travelers are required to obtain a Tibet Travel Permit before entering the region and applications must be submitted through a certified travel agency.
     
            Travelers need to join a group tour or book a tour guide, a driver, a car and accommodation via a certified travel agency to be eligible for the permit.
     
            Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China have different visa requirements.
     
            Hong Kong offers visa-free entry to citizens of about 170 countries for seven to 180 days. You can check out your specific visa requirements on the Hong Kong Immigration Department’s website. (Under Part II on the web page.)
     
            Some 80 international citizens can enter Macao without a visa. Check out Macao’s government website for more details.
     
            The southern Chinese island province of Hainan – often referred to as the ‘Hawaii of China’ has a more lenient visa policy than the rest of the mainland.
     
            It offers 30-day visa-free entry for passport holders from 59 countries. Travelers entering under this policy are not permitted to leave the island to visit other parts of China.
     
            You can use your own mobile devices in mainland China, however, some of the most popular apps for the rest of the world – including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and Google – are blocked.
     
            Thankfully, there are ways around this. If your phone is connected through an international data roaming plan or a travel SIM card with a VPN, you’ll still be able to access these apps.
     
            When you connect to local Wi-Fi, access will be suspended again.
     
            “A lot of websites we Westerners use are restricted in China,” says Correira. “The Wi-Fi in restaurants and hotels doesn’t allow us to use Google, Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp and if you end up buying a local SIM at your arrival these will have the same restrictions.
     
            “My tip: definitely use an e-SIM that you can even buy in advance and activate there and bypass that to be able to keep in touch with friends and family.”
     
            For a flat fee, e-SIM cards from companies like Airalo and Airsim will ensure your devices work in China – and that includes access to all essential apps.
     
            “Before traveling to China, many people worry about making payments,” says travel specialist Tian.
     
            “They think that people in China are all using mobile payments and cash is no longer accepted. But actually, cash is still accepted everywhere. Just some businesses may not have change to give.”
     
            International credit cards are not a ubiquitous form of payment at most local businesses and attractions.
     
WeChat Pay and Alipay are among the mobile wallets most Chinese businesses accept. Both apps can now be connected with an international credit card with a transaction limit of US$500.
     
            To increase the limit, you can verify your identity by uploading identification documents and entering your phone number. It will take a few days before the increase is approved.
     
            “The apps are not very friendly to foreigners, Chinese information often appears in the apps. However it is still easy for foreigners to set up the app themselves,” says Tian. (The China Guide has written a detailed article on how to set up your Alipay account.)
     
            If you’d like to avoid the app, you may have to just exchange cash and stick with restaurants and hotels that take international credit cards. Even though cash is technically accepted, not everyone – cough, taxi drivers, cough – is happy to take it. Small bills will be useful as many small business owners may not have change.
     
            Beijing, meanwhile, has introduced the “Beijing Pass,” an all-in-one travel card that allows you to pay for public transportation and tickets at many of the attractions. It can be purchased at airports and most metro stations.
     
            In short, not all attractions, hotels and restaurants take credit cards.
     
            But that might be changing.
     
            The Chinese government recently announced in a statement that “domestic and overseas bank cards should be accepted in all three-star and above tourist hotels, 5A-level and 4A-level national tourist attractions, national and provincial tourist resorts, as well as national tourism and leisure districts.”
     
            China claims to have one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
     
            But it’s not potential physical harm or threats targeting tourists that have prompted some countries to issue travel warnings and advisories to leisure tourists thinking of visiting.
     
            The United States has imposed a Level 3 travel advisory for mainland China under its four-level warning system and has urged citizens to “reconsider travel” “due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws.”
     
            Canada, meanwhile, advises its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution in China “due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws.”
     
            Correira says they enjoyed their first experience in China, but admits they had some concerns before their journey.
     
            “I think one of the main fears we had was regarding political safety,” recalls the doctor, noting they were aware of the US State Department’s Level 3 warning for China.
     
            “Of course, I can only speak about my experience but I had the exact opposite sensation. I thought authorities were friendly and helpful and I think as long as everyone is respectful (as we should be no matter where we are), China is perfectly safe and I didn’t feel someone being hostile towards me at any moment,” adds Correira.
     
            In addition to the above advice on setting up your mobile payments and purchasing a travel e-SIM before your visit, there are several handy apps that will make your trip go smoother. Here are a few of them:
     
            Google Maps doesn’t work in China if you don’t have a VPN. Even if you do have one, it doesn’t work well.
     
            Gaode Maps and Baidu Maps are two apps that work reasonably ok if you type in the address in pinyin, the romanization system for Chinese characters used in China.
     
            For iPhone users, Apple Maps works in China as well.
     
            “After we arrived, it was much more smooth sailing than anticipated since Apple Maps works perfectly fine and is updated with regards to public transportation,” Correira says of her experience.
     
            This transportation app covers major subway systems in China, in English.
     
            There is also a map function that highlights nearby points of interest, from restaurants to attractions.
     
            Most subways in Chinese cities are modern and easy to navigate, with signs in both English and Chinese.
     
            It’s worth noting there are security checks at many metro stations around China. Some are stricter than others, so prepare for bottlenecks during rush hour – and you may not be allowed on a train if you’ve been knife or scissor shopping.
     
            Even if you don’t use WeChat for its payment function, it’s still useful if you want to exchange contacts with a friendly local, open a menu at a restaurant (many of the restaurants have uploaded their menus to WeChat) and buy a high-speed railway ticket.
     
            Many of China’s major e-commerce businesses, from Didi (the Uber of China) to 12306 (the digital platform for the China Railway company) have their own WeChat widgets, or mini-programs.
     
            If WeChat is too complicated for you and you simply want an app for payment, Alipay is the way to go. There is an international and a Chinese version of the app; go for the international version and it will allow you to link your international credit card to it.
     
            The car-hailing app of China. You can connect the app with an international credit card.
     
            Didi can also be found within the Alipay and WeChat apps – so if you have one of the payment apps, you can directly hire a car from it without having to download the Didi app.
     
            The international travel booking platform of Ctrip.
     
            Trip.com is one of the easiest ways to book high-speed rail tickets, attraction tickets and hotels in China.

            Shanghai was brought to a standstill on Monday by what authorities say was the strongest typhoon to directly hit the Chinese financial hub in more than seven decades, with flights, trains and highways suspended during a national holiday.
     
            Typhoon Bebinca made landfall in an industrial suburb southeast of the metropolis of 25 million people at about 7:30 a.m. local time. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) said it packed top wind speeds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane.
     
            The China Meteorological Administration recorded wind speeds of 151 kph (94 mph) near the typhoon’s eye when it made landfall, and state media described it as the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since 1949.
     
            The administration on Monday issued a red typhoon warning, its most severe alert, warning of gale force winds, heavy rainfall and coastal floods in large swathes of eastern China.
     
            The powerful storm has disrupted travel plans for holidaymakers during the Mid-Autumn festival, or Moon Festival, a three-day national holiday that started on Sunday.
     
            All flights at Shanghai’s two international airports have been canceled since 8 p.m. Sunday. The city also suspended its ferry services, halted some train lines and closed ports, bridges and highways on Monday.
     
            Many tourist destinations in the city, including Shanghai Disney Resort, were also shut on Monday. Videos on Douyin, China’s version of Tiktok, show Disney staff taping trash bins to fences at the park.
     
            More than 414,000 people in Shanghai had been evacuated to safety by midnight Monday, with exhibition centers and school gyms turned into makeshift shelters, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
     
            Similar safety measures were also adopted in the neighboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. Across the region, more than 1,600 flights had been canceled as of Monday afternoon, according to CCTV.
     
            On Chinese social media, some Shanghai residents reported power and water outages on Monday morning. Many had rushed to stock up on food and supplies over the weekend.
     
            The typhoon is expected to quickly weaken into a tropical storm as it moves inland toward the west.
     
            Bebinca is the second major storm to hit China this month, following deadly Super Typhoon Yagi, the world’s second most powerful tropical cyclone so far this year.
     
            Yagi killed four people in the southern province of Hainan after making landfall on September 6 with maximum sustained wind speeds of 230 kph (140 mph), the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, before wreaking devastation across parts of Southeast Asia.
     
            Scientists have found that hotter oceans caused by the human-caused climate crisis are leading storms to intensify more rapidly.
     
            Shanghai is generally not in the direct path of strong typhoons, which typically make landfall further south in China. Prior to Bebinca, the city had only been directly hit by two typhoons – in 1949 and 2022 – plus a handful of severe tropical storms, according to data from the China Meteorological Administration.

            The Biden administration said Friday that it has finalized tariff hikes on certain Chinese-made products that the president first announced in May.
     
            The tariff rate will go up to 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% on solar cells and to 25% on electrical vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes beginning September 27, according to the US Trade Representative’s Office.
     
            Tariff hikes on other products, including semiconductor chips, are set to take effect over the next two years.

Americans are still paying more for shoes, luggage and hats after Biden left Trump’s tariffs in place
 
            The administration’s increases – which impact a relatively small amount of US imports – come as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have clashed over tariffs on the campaign trail. Trump is calling for sweeping new duties on all imports, while Harris has said that his proposal would raise prices on American households.
     
            Trump implemented sweeping tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made products when he was in office. President Joe Biden has kept those tariffs in place and, after the USTR finished a multiyear review earlier this year, decided to increase some of the rates on about $15 billion of Chinese imports.
     
            The products that will now face increases are in line with Biden’s other economic policies aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing in industries including clean energy and semiconductor chips.
     
            “Today’s finalized tariff increases will target the harmful policies and practices of the People’s Republic of China that continue to impact American workers and businesses,” US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a press release.
     
            China is expected to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US-made goods.
     
            Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters in May that China opposes “the unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.”
     
            Also on Friday, the Biden administration announced a new effort to limit the amount of foreign goods that can come into the US tariff-free because they are valued at $800 or less.
     
            The majority of shipments using this exemption, known as “de minimis,” are coming from China, the White House said. The administration’s change to the trade regulation will make some imports ineligible for the exemption. It will take effect after a public comment period.
     
            Tariffs can be politically popular, even though many economists agree they are costly tools that don’t always boost domestic industries as promised.
     
            They are meant to raise prices of foreign-made goods as a way of protecting domestic producers. Many Democrats and Republicans agree that Beijing has long used unfair trading practices to make Chinese-made goods more competitive.
     
            Still, there are major differences to note between Trump’s call for sweeping tariffs and the Biden administration’s more targeted approach.
     
            If elected, Trump has said he will significantly increase the tariffs the US has on imports from all over the world. He’s called for new tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US. For context, the US imported $3.2 trillion worth of goods in 2022, per the latest data available.
     
            Trump has also called for adding another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports and said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar.

Fact check: Trump and Vance keep falsely describing how tariffs work
 
            Trump has said that the revenue brought in by these new tariffs, which is paid by importers in the US, could be used to lower taxes and pay for child care.
     
            Harris, who hasn’t given many details about how she would use – or not use – tariffs, has repeatedly attacked Trump’s proposal, calling it a “Trump sales tax.”
     
            She has pointed to a study that shows Trump’s proposed tariffs would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank.
     
            Other studies have also said the proposed tariffs would raise prices for families, but by a smaller amount. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, for example, said the impact could be an additional $1,350 a year for middle-income households.
     
Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
     
            Once an importer pays for the tariff, it usually passes along some or all of the cost to the consumer.
     
            But when it comes to the new tariff hike – from 27.5% to 100% – on electric vehicles, American consumers may not see a sudden jump in prices. That’s because the US already imports a relatively small amount of electric vehicles from China.
     
            Since 2018, Chinese electric vehicle imports have increased from $7.2 million to $388.8 million – but were only 2% of all US electric vehicle imports, according to the US International Trade Commission.
     
            Still, US automakers fear Chinese-made electric vehicles, which are sold for as little as $10,000, could end up flooding the US market.
     
            “China now produces 70 percent of the world’s electric cars – jeopardizing productive investments elsewhere,” USTR wrote in its recent report.
     
            Steel and aluminum trade groups and unions also welcomed the news after Biden first said in April he was considering a tariff hike on steel during a speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh. But some analysts say the move could have little impact on the US steel industry because China accounts for a very small percentage of US steel imports.

            Chinese regulators have hit PwC’s auditing unit in mainland China with a six-month business suspension and a record fine of 441 million yuan ($62 million) over the firm’s audit of troubled property developer China Evergrande Group.
     
            Delivering a strong rebuke to the Big Four firm, China’s securities regulator said Friday that its investigation found that PwC Zhong Tian LLP helped cover up and “even condone” Evergrande’s fraud while auditing the annual results of the developer’s onshore flagship unit — Hengda Real Estate — in 2019 and 2020.
     
            “PwC has seriously eroded the basis of law and good faith, and damaged investors’ interest,” said the China Securities Regulatory Commission in a statement.
     
            Chinese authorities have been examining PwC’s role in the accounting of Hengda Real Estate since the CSRC accused the developer in March of a $78-billion fraud over a period of two years through 2020.
     
            The business suspension and fines are the toughest ever penalty received by a Big Four accounting firm in China and come against the backdrop of an exodus of clientele and layoffs at the firm in recent months.
     
            The move is set to cloud PwC’s prospects in the world’s no. 2 economy. PwC Zhong Tian, the registered accounting entity and the main onshore arm of PwC in China, was the country’s top-earning auditor in 2022, according to the latest official data.
     
            “We are disappointed by PwC Zhong Tian’s audit work of Hengda, which fell unacceptably below the standards we expect of member firms of the PwC network,” PwC network, the alliance of PwC’s global member units, said in a statement.
     
            The firm said that, as part of its “accountability and remedial actions,” PwC China’s territory senior partner Daniel Li had stepped down and Hemione Hudson, the firm’s global risk and regulatory leader, had taken over from him.
     
            The six-month business suspension was imposed by China’s Ministry of Finance. The ministry also imposed a fine of 116 million yuan ($16 million) on PwC Zhong Tian for its auditing failure of Hengda in 2018, according to an MOF statement.

            The CSRC said in a separate statement that it had confiscated PwC Zhong Tian’s revenue involved in the Evergrande case totalling 27.7 million yuan and fined the unit 297 million yuan.
     
            “PwC has, to a certain extent, covered up and even condoned Evergrande’s financial fraud and fraudulent issuance of corporate bonds,” said the CSRC statement.
     
            “It (PwC) has to be severely punished according to law.”
     
            Over the past few months, a growing number of Chinese clients, mainly state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, has been leaving PwC, following the launch of the regulatory investigation into the firm.
     
            The firm had about 400 Chinese clients, listed at home or in offshore markets such as Hong Kong or New York, in March this year, including tech behemoths Alibaba and Tencent.
     
            A Reuters calculation based on filings showed more than 50 Chinese firms, including PwC’s largest mainland China-listed client Bank of China, have either dropped PwC as their auditor or canceled their plans to hire it.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/china/china-raises-retirement-age-intl-hnk/index.html,"For decades, Chinese workers have retired relatively early. That’s about to change","For decades, Chinese workers have wrapped up their working lives at relatively young ages: 60 for men and as early as 50 for women.","Sep 13, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
            For decades, Chinese workers have wrapped up their working lives at relatively young ages: 60 for men and as early as 50 for women.
     
            But all that is about to change as the Chinese government passed new legislation on Friday laying out a plan to delay the retirement age over the course of 15 years, starting January 1, according to state news agency Xinhua.
     
            Existing rules stated that men in urban areas could retire at 60 and receive their pensions, and women at 50 or 55, depending on their occupation. The new rules gradually push back the age to 63 for men, and to 55 and 58, respectively, for women.
     
            The measures, which were approved by the country’s top lawmaking body following signaling from a key Communist Party body in July, also lay out plans to extend the minimum working period for employees to receive a monthly pension from 15 to 20 years, with changes starting from 2030.
     
            They also include some flexibility in retirement age, especially for those who have already completed the minimum working period.
     
            The change, which the government has been considering for about a decade, comes as China’s economy slows while Beijing grapples with the looming consequences of a rapidly aging population and a pension funding crisis.
     
            The announcement sparked immediate widespread discussion – and backlash – across Chinese social media.
     
            Some social media users appeared encouraged that the changes weren’t more drastic and included some flexibility. One comment on the X-like social media platform Weibo that garnered thousands of likes said: “As long as there are options to retire or not based on our will, I have no objections.”
     
            Others voiced discontent over the prospect of delayed access to their pension and years of extra work, as well as concern about whether the policy would strain China’s already tough job market, where unemployment levels among young people remain stubbornly high.
     
            “Delayed retirements just means you can’t get your pension until you hit 63, but it doesn’t mean everyone will have a job until then!” wrote one user.
     
            Chinese state media in recent days has hailed the anticipated changes as an urgent and necessary reform for an outmoded system, highlighting how the existing policy had been in place since the 1950s when life expectancies and education levels were both lower.

            “The current retirement policy framework has remained unchanged for 73 years. Especially since the reform and opening up (starting around 1978), the demographic, economic and social landscape has transformed dramatically,” demographer Yuan Xin was quoted by state media as saying earlier this week.
     
            The existing retirement age is seriously mismatched with the current “national realities” and the new normal of future economic and social development, said Yuan, who is deputy head of the China Population Association and a demographer at Nankai University in Tianjin.
     
            China’s existing retirement ages are lower than those in a number of major economies. The 2022 average standard retirement ages across Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries stood at 63.6 years old for women and 64.4 years old for men.
     
            Other countries have also grappled with how to manage the retirement age. Major protests erupted in France in 2023 in response to a government attempt to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The US has also been debating retirement reform and gradually increasing the retirement age, with Social Security incentives in place for retirees who delay taking benefits until age 70.
     
            The changes come as China’s leadership has become increasingly concerned by the country’s demographic challenges, which some economists warn could see the still-developing country fall into the trap of “getting old before it gets rich.”
     
            China’s population has shrunk for the past two years, and in 2023 it recorded its lowest birth rate since the founding of Communist China in 1949, despite a reversal of the country’s long-standing “one-child policy” from 2016 and government-led efforts to incentivize more young couples to have children.
     
            China’s elderly now account for more than 20% of the population, according to a report earlier this month from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which said about 297 million were aged 60 and above by the end of last year.
     
            Demographers cited in state media have said that, between 2030 and 2035, the elderly population will make up 30% of the total population. That is likely to increase to more than 40% of the population by the middle of this century – making China a “super-aged society.”

China’s population declines for second straight year as economy stumbles
 
            Those projections have seen the government ramping up efforts to expand elderly care services and boost private-sector efforts to build a “silver economy.”
     
            It’s also put heightened focus on the ability of the country’s pension system to handle a shrinking workforce alongside its burgeoning elderly population.
     
            A 2019 report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, forecast that China’s state pension fund would run dry by 2035 because of its dwindling workforce. Years of strict pandemic-related restrictions, which have shrunk the coffers of local governments, could make the pension shortfall even more pronounced.
     
            Early last year, thousands of elderly people protested in several major cities against big cuts to their medical benefits payments, fearing that local governments were dipping into their individual accounts to cover the shortages in the state pension fund.
     
            Even for those of working age, employment remains a steep challenge following the pandemic and a raft of government-led industry crackdowns in recent years. In July, the youth unemployment rate hit 17.1% among those aged between 16 and 24 who are not students, and was 6.5% for those 25 to 29 that month, according to state media.
     
            Employers continue to pull back on hiring as the economy slows and people, especially in tech sectors, have widely noted age discrimination in hiring for those over 35.
     
            The new regulations also call on the state to “support young people’s employment and entrepreneurship, strengthen the development of employment positions for older workers … and strengthen the prevention and governance of employment age discrimination.”

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            A Chinese “reusable experimental spacecraft” believed to be the country’s secretive space plane has landed back on Earth after more than eight months in orbit – the latest development in a largely covert race between the United States and China to hone such technology.
     
            China’s spacecraft blasted into orbit last December – two weeks ahead of the latest launch of the US military’s own Boeing X-37B uncrewed space plane – on the third known orbital mission of such a Chinese spacecraft.
     
            Some 268 days later, the spacecraft returned to an unnamed landing site, according to a brief September 6 announcement from state news agency Xinhua, which declared its test mission a “complete success.”
     
            China’s development of the vehicle, about which little is publicly known, comes after recent years of striving to catch up to the US, long the world’s preeminent space power, for dominance in orbit and beyond.
     
            Here’s what we know – and don’t – about China’s space plane.
     
            The term “space plane” often evokes NASA’s Space Shuttle, which flew 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, carrying astronauts into orbit and helping to construct the International Space Station. It might also recall the Soviet Union’s ill-fated Buran space shuttle, which completed one successful uncrewed flight in 1988 before being discontinued.
     
            But the newer planes currently being tested in orbit by the US and China are believed to be smaller than the shuttle and uncrewed. The US X-37B is operated by the military, while China has not said whether the program believed to be linked to its recently landed spacecraft is civilian or military.
     
            Space planes are generally reusable craft similar to both an airplane and a spacecraft in that they can fly in Earth’s atmosphere and in space. Both the Chinese spacecraft that recently returned to Earth and the US’ X-37B, which has conducted seven missions since its 2010 debut, are launched on rockets into outer space but land like airplanes on runways, experts say.
     
            Space planes are valued for their potential to carry out a range of missions in orbit and help countries respond quickly to developments in space, while advancing reusable spacecraft technology that could be used for more regular human space travel in the future.
     
            “It’s no surprise that the Chinese are extremely interested in our space plane, and we’re extremely interested in theirs,” US Space Force chief of operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told reporters at a conference in December.
     
            “It is a capability – the ability to put something in orbit, do some things, and bring it home and take a look at the results is powerful.”
     
            Not too much.
     
            China has never said what specific technologies the spacecraft has tested, or released any photographs of it, since it began operating in orbit in 2020.
     
            A video shared on the social media channel of state-backed space contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation announcing the spacecraft’s September 6 landing featured a banner instead of images. The text read: “It’s too advanced to be shown.”
     
            Even the name of the spacecraft that landed back on Earth has not been confirmed by the Chinese government, though observers suspect it is the “Shenlong” space plane, which has been under development for two decades.

            Other space plane projects under development in recent years in China have been publicly and officially described as civilian projects, while the official purpose of Shenlong remains unconfirmed, experts say.
     
            It’s also unknown if this is the same vehicle or another in the same series that completed two previous missions – the first in 2020 lasted two days and the second beginning in 2022 lasted 273. All are believed by analysts to have ended with landings at the secretive Lop Nur military facility in Xinjiang, in the country’s far northwest.
     
            An official announcement after its December 14 launch said the spacecraft would “carry out reusable technology verification and space science experiments as planned, providing technical support for the peaceful use of space.”
     
            But space observers are able – via open-source data, imaging and positional measurements – to monitor what the vehicle has been up to in space, including tracking the release of what they say is a suspected “sub-satellite” in late May and its apparent efforts to maneuver around the object. That follows similar exercises on previous tests missions.
     
            “This capability to maneuver close to another object could be used for inspection of space assets, or potentially the clearing of orbits of space debris. But they could be used for nefarious purposes, including interception of signals or the physical damaging of other spacecraft,” said Juliana Suess, a research fellow for space security at London-based defense think tank the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI.
     
            China’s space plane development comes as a growing number of countries are paying attention to the deepening connections between security on Earth and in space – and vying for so-called counterspace technologies with the potential to disrupt or even destroy adversaries’ assets in space.
     
            China has been explicit in recent announcements about the peaceful purposes of the spacecraft and its other endeavors in space, though analysts say it is among world powers developing counterspace capabilities.
     
            The state media announcement of the spacecraft’s landing said it would “pave the way for more convenient and affordable round-trip methods for the peaceful use of space in the future.”
     
            Analysts say there’s no evidence that China’s space plane is being designed to act as a counterspace weapon, but that information and capabilities gained on its missions could have dual-use applications.
     
            “Anything that China learns from operating its space plane, no matter its main purpose, will benefit its counterspace efforts,” said Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington.
     
            “In addition to maturing space technologies, it’s allowing China to mature its muscle memory for operating in space. It’s concerning how China could apply those learnings to counterspace weapons,” he said.
     
            It’s hard to compare China’s space plane with the US’ X-37B, due to the high level of secrecy around both programs.
     
            The X-37B has been in operation for years longer than China’s space plane and has stayed in orbit significantly longer, a record set during its sixth mission of a 908-day journey before returning to Earth in November 2022.
     
            The US Space Force, which oversees the X-37B, describes it as a reusable, uncrewed spacecraft that “strengthens the United States’ future in space by conducting technology experiments that expedite the development of next-generation capabilities.”
     
            Its latest mission includes tests operating in new regions of orbit, experimenting with space domain awareness technologies to monitor objects in space, and investigating radiation effects on NASA materials, including plant seeds, the force has said.

            But observers have also raised questions about the activities of the space plane, including its own deployment of multiple small satellites.
     
            The level of secrecy around the deployment of those satellites “may indicate they are part of a covert intelligence program, but it may also indicate the testing of offensive technologies or capabilities,” the independent US-based Secure World Foundation noted in a recent report, while pointing to “similar behavior in terms of secret deployments” from the Shenlong space plane.
     
            Observers also note that China is likely using the US program as a benchmark for its own.
     
            “The fact they now have a reusable spacecraft just by itself shows how far they have come (and) the fact it was up for so long, and returned safely,” said Brendan Mulvaney, director of the China Aerospace Studies Institute, a US Air Force think tank, noting the Chinese claim of mission success earlier this month.
     
            “All of that means they are putting in the time, effort, and investments, to make it work.  China is the undisputed No. 2 space power and is aiming to close the gap with the US in military, commercial, and scientific realms, all at the same time,” he said.

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            Married for seven years, Hansen and his wife Momo care for six little ones at their apartment in downtown Beijing.
     
            But they adopt a slightly different parenting routine from your typical mom and dad: They play fetch with them and take them out for daily walks.
     
            These little ones are not their offspring, but “fur babies,” or “mao hai zi,” in Chinese, and the couple loves them so much they refer to them as “our daughters, our sons.”
     
            “They are all part of our family. We are one big family,” said Momo, who gave only her nickname for fear that she may get into trouble with authorities for openly speaking about her choice of lifestyle – one that is at odds with China’s effort to boost birth rates.
     
China is grappling with a fast-aging population and shrinking labor force after decades of enforcing a one-child policy. The country is also one of the most expensive places in the world to raise a child in relative terms, easily beating Australia and France, according to a study from the Beijing-based YuWa Population Research Institute earlier this year.
     
            After ending the one-child policy in 2016 and making yet another major birth policy shift in 2021, the government now wants couples to have three children. But Beijing hasn’t been as successful in driving up births as it was in deterring them.
     
            Many Chinese couples like Hansen, 36, and Momo, 35, are not sold on children. Instead, they’ve become pet parents.
     
            By the end of the year, the number of pets in China’s cities is expected to surpass the number of children aged four and under, according to a July research report by investment bank Goldman Sachs that examined rising demand for pet food.
     
            By 2030, the number of pets in urban China alone will almost double the number of young children across the country, according to its projection. The country’s pet ownership rate would be even higher if the number of dogs and cats in rural areas were included.
     
            The Goldman Sachs estimates reflect the changing values of a generation that no longer subscribes to the traditional thinking that marriage is about giving birth and passing on the family lineage.
     
            “Different generations value things differently, you know,” said Hansen, who also only gave his nickname.
     
            In predicting a surge in sales for dog and cat food, Goldman Sachs revealed a trend that’s been giving Chinese officials a big headache.
     
            The country’s population declined for the first time in decades in 2022 in what analysts said was its first drop since the 1961 famine triggered by former leader Mao Zedong’s disastrous plan, the Great Leap Forward. A year later, China was surpassed by India as the world’s most populous country.
     
            Goldman found pet food to be one of the fastest growing consumer sectors in China, which is expanding despite otherwise anemic spending. Sales grew an average of 16% each year between 2017 and 2023, creating a $7 billion industry. The industry’s value is expected to surge to $12 billion in 2030, the report added. At its most optimistic, pet food could become a $15 billion industry in China in six years.
     
            It’s a far cry from just two decades ago, when pet ownership was still considered a bourgeois concept and people kept mixed breeds as guard dogs.
     
            And even now, pet ownership remains comparatively low, according to Goldman Sachs. Last year, the percentage of dog-keeping households in Chinese cities stood at 5.6%, significantly lower than its neighbors and giving it room to grow, it said. Japan reached 17.5% in 2009, according to the report.
     
            Its predictions for babies were less rosy. The report projected the number of new births in China to contract at an average annual rate of 4.2% between 2022 and 2030 because of a decline of women in the 20 to 35 age group, as well as young people’s reluctance to have children.
     
            “We expect to see stronger momentum in pet ownership amid a relatively weaker birth rate outlook and higher incremental household pet penetration from the younger generation,” the report added.
     
            Many couples find it tough to face the ballooning cost of raising children in uncertain economic times. The world’s second biggest economy is facing headwinds ranging from high youth unemployment to a protracted property crisis.
     
            Authorities are now offering a slew of incentives, from cash to more parental leave, to promote parenthood – in a complete reversal of previous measures to stem overpopulation, which included forced abortion and sterilization.
     
            But, like many of its East Asian neighbors, the new benefits aren’t having much of an effect.
     
            China’s population plunged to 1.409 billion last year, shrinking two years in a row. Its birth rate also dipped to 6.39 births per 1,000 people, the lowest rate since the founding of Communist China in 1949.
     
            Tao, 38, runs Space, a dog lodge in Beijing. For her, the preference for pets means good business.
     
            With China’s national day holiday fast approaching, dog owners are scrambling to find someone to look after their canines during the peak travel season that begins on October 1.
     
            “We were almost fully booked for that holiday,” she said.
     
            Tao, who gave also only her nickname, has two dogs and no kids. Her family used to pressure her to have kids, she said, but she knew that was not the life she wanted.
     
            “I enjoy my lifestyle. My partner and I will travel a lot. I like to go see the world. So, the idea of having kids just wasn’t attractive enough for me,” she said.
     
            She felt the mentality of the younger generation had changed. “I feel like people start to be more like, ‘This is what I want,’ or ‘This is what I like for my life,’ rather than like, ‘This is what the society taught me to do,’ or ‘This is what my parents want me to do,’ ” Tao added.
     
            Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor of social science and public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said children and pets aren’t mutually exclusive in China.
     
            But young couples are facing mounting challenges from unemployment to social pressure, such as long work hours and the expectation that some women will give up their careers after giving birth, he said.

            “If you’re a 20-something in China and you feel the strong need to nurture, it is much easier to get a puppy, kitten or rabbit than find a partner to get married and give birth to children with,” Gietel-Basten said.
     
            For Hansen and Momo, they simply enjoy the company of their fur babies.
     
            “We’re not following any trend. We’re not affected by them. It’s just our own choice. I think it’s just that we love dogs,” Hansen said.
     
            He said he looked forward to coming home every day because his dogs are so excited to see him.
     
            “This cures everything,” he said.
     
            At a women’s conference last year, China’s leader Xi Jinping lectured delegates about fostering a new type of marriage and childbearing culture. The message was clear for Chinese women: Get married and have babies.
     
            But Momo says the country should “make do” without her genes.
     
            “I feel that (China) does not lack this one kid from me,” she said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/travel/china-travel-tips-visas-mobile-payments-intl-hnk/index.html,Planning a trip to China can be confusing. Here are the issues tripping up many foreign tourists,China has been amping up efforts to lure international tourists by introducing more welcoming policies. Here’s what travelers planning a journey to this vast nation need to know.,"Sep 11, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Maggie Hiufu Wong,China,"
            Traveling to China as a foreigner isn’t the simplest affair.
     
            Visa applications can be complicated, while international flights are limited and more expensive right now due to lower demand and higher costs for many airlines to fly around Russian airspace.
     
            And once you manage to wade through all of that, navigating this highly automated society with its own digital ecosystem can be intimidating – particularly for first-time visitors.
     
            But things may be changing.
     
            China has been amping up efforts to lure international travelers since reopening its doors following the pandemic at the end of 2022 by introducing more welcoming policies – and it’s asked the private sector to help, too.
     
            The country now offers visa exemptions for dozens of nationalities, as well as a 144-hour visa-free transit policy at a growing number of ports of entry.

            Meanwhile, mobile wallet giants like Alipay and WeChat have made their apps and payment processes more foreigner-friendly by simplifying their lengthy set-up processes and accepting international credit cards.
     
            Hotels and attractions are also being asked to accept international credit cards, which aren’t popular among merchants in China. Some cities like Beijing have launched all-in-one passes that allow travelers to electronically pay for things like attraction admissions and public transit.
     
            Looking at the stats alone, these measures seem to be working.
     
            China welcomed about 14 million foreign visitors in the first half of 2024, a 152.7% increase from 2023, according to the country’s National Immigration Administration. Around half of those travelers entered the country under various types of visa-free policies.
     
            The number is still a long way off from 2019 figures, when some 98 million foreign visitors traveled to the country, but some in the industry are encouraged by the upward trend.
     
            “Thanks to the new 15-day visa-free policy for some countries, we have seen an increase of tourists from those countries in the last year or so,” says Denny Tian, a travel specialist and manager at The China Guide, a Beijing-based private-tour travel agency.
     
            Gabriela Correia, 25, a doctor from Portugal, visited Shanghai and Beijing in June this year with her American boyfriend, entering the country under the 144-hour visa-free transit policy. It allows travelers from 54 countries (including Portugal and the US) on their way to a third country to make a stopover in one of several designated Chinese regions for up to six days.
     
            “It is important to note that planning a trip to China comes with more challenges than most places in the world,” says Correia, who has visited 47 countries so far.
     
            “The amount of information you find online is limited due to the relatively small number of Westerners going to China and because Google Maps is restricted in China.”
     
            Travel specialist Tian tells CNN Travel the language barrier has long been a big challenge for international travelers.
     
            “Many places only have Chinese information,” he says. “Most of the service staff do not speak English.”
     
            But he says there are ways to overcome these difficulties like downloading a translator app. Meanwhile, some airports have been making an extra effort by hiring multilingual staff to welcome visitors in different languages.
     
            “Not knowing Chinese definitely came with its challenges but I would say that made this trip even more fun,” says Correira.
     
            “People are very welcoming and make an effort to make it work. We had a lovely experience in a tea specialty restaurant even though none of the workers could speak English. We used the Google Translate photo feature to translate the menu and made it work out. We ended up getting cheesecake while we thought we were getting cheese bread for starters but who doesn’t like to have an extra dessert?”
     
            The doctor says she used a travel SIM card that came with a virtual private network (VPN) to access her usual mobile apps such as Google Translate. (More on this in the Q&A section below.)
     
            Correira also notes that many restaurants ask diners to order through a QR code that is linked to Alipay, which now has a translation function incorporated into the app, allowing foreign visitors to know what’s on the menu.
     
            Although the couple managed to have a great time traveling independently without knowing Chinese, they decided to hire a private guide for their visit to the Great Wall “as it facilitates logistics and allows you to go to (lesser-traveled) sections of the Wall.”
     
            The couple was most impressed by the “diverse and rich culinary traditions,” the contrasting futuristic and historical colonial architecture along the waterfront of Shanghai as well as the views and a toboggan ride at Mutianyu Great Wall in Beijing.
     
            Correira says that the trip has changed some of her perceptions about China and she is already planning their next trip.
     
            “I would say right now Zhangjiajie National Forest Park is at the top of my list in my next visit to China,” she says, referring to a national park in Hunan province that is said to have inspired the landscapes in the movie “Avatar.”
     
            Planning your own dream trip to this vast nation? We’ve put together a guide to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding China travel.
     
            Here’s where things get really confusing. There have been a lot of announcements and changes in recent months, and we will try to cover the most notable.
     
            China has mutual visa exemption agreements with 23 countries – including Singapore and Thailand – and a new unilateral visa-free policy for 15 additional passports.
     
            The 15 countries now enjoying visa exemptions until December 31, 2025 are Austria, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Switzerland.
     
            Citizens of these countries can visit China for no more than 15 days continuously without a visa.

            Given how quickly things change in the diplomatic world, it’s wise to visit the China Visa Application Service Center or your country’s foreign affairs website to find out the latest on entry agreements before booking your trip.
     
            If your country isn’t on the visa-free list or you don’t want to visit China on a stopover (more on that below), you will need to apply for a tourist visa.
     
            On that front, there’s good news for Americans. China tourist visa application processes have been easier for US citizens since January 2024; applicants are no longer required to submit proof of a round-trip air ticket, hotel reservation, itinerary or invitation letter. (The Chinese consulate general in New York has put together a list of documents you now need to apply for a tourist visa on its website.)
     
            Citizens of other countries in need of a tourist visa can head to China Online Visa Application to find their nearest processing center and fill in the online application form.
     
            China’s two visa-free transit policies allow travelers from certain countries to enter China for up to three or six days – but only if they’re transiting to a third destination, outside of China, afterward.
     
            Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the 54 countries eligible to transit via China for up to six days.
     
            In both cases, travelers need to present purchased travel documents – i.e. connecting tickets for flights, trains and ships – as proof of their next stop (one that is different from the travelers’ original departure country) before entering China. (Hong Kong and Macao are considered a third destination under these policies.)

            However, travelers visiting under these visa-free transit programs have more restrictions in terms of places they can visit.
     
            They can only travel within the 41 designated ports of entry in 19 Chinese provinces – including Beijing and Shanghai.
     
            That means that if you land in Shanghai, then you can only stay within the city and its neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. Exploring the country via China’s vast high-speed railway network is not an option for those entering under the two transit visa schemes.
     
            Correira says she and her boyfriend ended up making a trip to another part of Asia in between their visits to Shanghai and Beijing so they could get two visa-free transit permits for each visit. (The Shanghai government has put together a great explainer about the visa-free transit policy here.)
     
            Travelers aren’t required to join a guided tour or a group tour for most parts of China if they have the appropriate visa or if their passports qualify them for the visa-free exemption policy – with a major exception being the Tibet Autonomous Region.
     
            International travelers are required to obtain a Tibet Travel Permit before entering the region and applications must be submitted through a certified travel agency.
     
            Travelers need to join a group tour or book a tour guide, a driver, a car and accommodation via a certified travel agency to be eligible for the permit.
     
            Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China have different visa requirements.
     
            Hong Kong offers visa-free entry to citizens of about 170 countries for seven to 180 days. You can check out your specific visa requirements on the Hong Kong Immigration Department’s website. (Under Part II on the web page.)
     
            Some 80 international citizens can enter Macao without a visa. Check out Macao’s government website for more details.
     
            The southern Chinese island province of Hainan – often referred to as the ‘Hawaii of China’ has a more lenient visa policy than the rest of the mainland.
     
            It offers 30-day visa-free entry for passport holders from 59 countries. Travelers entering under this policy are not permitted to leave the island to visit other parts of China.
     
            You can use your own mobile devices in mainland China, however, some of the most popular apps for the rest of the world – including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and Google – are blocked.
     
            Thankfully, there are ways around this. If your phone is connected through an international data roaming plan or a travel SIM card with a VPN, you’ll still be able to access these apps.
     
            When you connect to local Wi-Fi, access will be suspended again.
     
            “A lot of websites we Westerners use are restricted in China,” says Correira. “The Wi-Fi in restaurants and hotels doesn’t allow us to use Google, Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp and if you end up buying a local SIM at your arrival these will have the same restrictions.
     
            “My tip: definitely use an e-SIM that you can even buy in advance and activate there and bypass that to be able to keep in touch with friends and family.”
     
            For a flat fee, e-SIM cards from companies like Airalo and Airsim will ensure your devices work in China – and that includes access to all essential apps.
     
            “Before traveling to China, many people worry about making payments,” says travel specialist Tian.
     
            “They think that people in China are all using mobile payments and cash is no longer accepted. But actually, cash is still accepted everywhere. Just some businesses may not have change to give.”
     
            International credit cards are not a ubiquitous form of payment at most local businesses and attractions.
     
WeChat Pay and Alipay are among the mobile wallets most Chinese businesses accept. Both apps can now be connected with an international credit card with a transaction limit of US$500.
     
            To increase the limit, you can verify your identity by uploading identification documents and entering your phone number. It will take a few days before the increase is approved.
     
            “The apps are not very friendly to foreigners, Chinese information often appears in the apps. However it is still easy for foreigners to set up the app themselves,” says Tian. (The China Guide has written a detailed article on how to set up your Alipay account.)
     
            If you’d like to avoid the app, you may have to just exchange cash and stick with restaurants and hotels that take international credit cards. Even though cash is technically accepted, not everyone – cough, taxi drivers, cough – is happy to take it. Small bills will be useful as many small business owners may not have change.
     
            Beijing, meanwhile, has introduced the “Beijing Pass,” an all-in-one travel card that allows you to pay for public transportation and tickets at many of the attractions. It can be purchased at airports and most metro stations.
     
            In short, not all attractions, hotels and restaurants take credit cards.
     
            But that might be changing.
     
            The Chinese government recently announced in a statement that “domestic and overseas bank cards should be accepted in all three-star and above tourist hotels, 5A-level and 4A-level national tourist attractions, national and provincial tourist resorts, as well as national tourism and leisure districts.”
     
            China claims to have one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
     
            But it’s not potential physical harm or threats targeting tourists that have prompted some countries to issue travel warnings and advisories to leisure tourists thinking of visiting.
     
            The United States has imposed a Level 3 travel advisory for mainland China under its four-level warning system and has urged citizens to “reconsider travel” “due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws.”
     
            Canada, meanwhile, advises its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution in China “due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws.”
     
            Correira says they enjoyed their first experience in China, but admits they had some concerns before their journey.
     
            “I think one of the main fears we had was regarding political safety,” recalls the doctor, noting they were aware of the US State Department’s Level 3 warning for China.
     
            “Of course, I can only speak about my experience but I had the exact opposite sensation. I thought authorities were friendly and helpful and I think as long as everyone is respectful (as we should be no matter where we are), China is perfectly safe and I didn’t feel someone being hostile towards me at any moment,” adds Correira.
     
            In addition to the above advice on setting up your mobile payments and purchasing a travel e-SIM before your visit, there are several handy apps that will make your trip go smoother. Here are a few of them:
     
            Google Maps doesn’t work in China if you don’t have a VPN. Even if you do have one, it doesn’t work well.
     
            Gaode Maps and Baidu Maps are two apps that work reasonably ok if you type in the address in pinyin, the romanization system for Chinese characters used in China.
     
            For iPhone users, Apple Maps works in China as well.
     
            “After we arrived, it was much more smooth sailing than anticipated since Apple Maps works perfectly fine and is updated with regards to public transportation,” Correira says of her experience.
     
            This transportation app covers major subway systems in China, in English.
     
            There is also a map function that highlights nearby points of interest, from restaurants to attractions.
     
            Most subways in Chinese cities are modern and easy to navigate, with signs in both English and Chinese.
     
            It’s worth noting there are security checks at many metro stations around China. Some are stricter than others, so prepare for bottlenecks during rush hour – and you may not be allowed on a train if you’ve been knife or scissor shopping.
     
            Even if you don’t use WeChat for its payment function, it’s still useful if you want to exchange contacts with a friendly local, open a menu at a restaurant (many of the restaurants have uploaded their menus to WeChat) and buy a high-speed railway ticket.
     
            Many of China’s major e-commerce businesses, from Didi (the Uber of China) to 12306 (the digital platform for the China Railway company) have their own WeChat widgets, or mini-programs.
     
            If WeChat is too complicated for you and you simply want an app for payment, Alipay is the way to go. There is an international and a Chinese version of the app; go for the international version and it will allow you to link your international credit card to it.
     
            The car-hailing app of China. You can connect the app with an international credit card.
     
            Didi can also be found within the Alipay and WeChat apps – so if you have one of the payment apps, you can directly hire a car from it without having to download the Didi app.
     
            The international travel booking platform of Ctrip.
     
            Trip.com is one of the easiest ways to book high-speed rail tickets, attraction tickets and hotels in China.

Now, he’s detained for slandering China’s heroes, family says","A prominent Chinese artist known for his political critiques of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution has been detained in China, after police raided his art studio near Beijing.","Sep 4, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
            A prominent Chinese artist known for his scathing political critiques of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution has been detained in China, according to his brother and artistic partner.
     
            Gao Zhen, 68, was detained last week in a police raid on his art studio on the outskirts of Beijing on suspicion of slandering China’s “heroes and martyrs,” his younger brother Gao Qiang told CNN Sunday in an email from New York. The criminal offense, introduced in 2021, is punishable by up to three years in prison.
     
            The public security bureau that Gao Qiang said had detained his brother, in Hebei province’s Sanhe city, declined to comment.
     
            At the height of their careers, the Gao Brothers created provocative sculptures of Mao in a country notoriously sensitive about its former ruler’s legacy. But that was well over a decade ago — during a relatively liberal era for artistic expression before China took an authoritarian turn under leader Xi Jinping.
     
            Now, some of those older works have been seized by police as evidence against Gao Zhen, his brother said.
     
            They include “Mao’s Guilt,” a life-size bronze cast created in 2009 that depicts the former Chinese Communist Party leader kneeling, hand on heart, in repentance; “The Execution of Christ,” created that same year, which features a firing squad of life-sized Chairman Maos pointing their bayoneted rifles at Jesus; and a collection of busts named “Miss Mao,” which come in various sizes and colors, sporting a Pinocchio-like nose and large, naked breasts.
     
            The avant-garde artists’ latest works had not been as politically sensitive or explicitly critical of Chinese leaders, their friends say. Gao Zhen had lived a quiet life in China and spent most days in his studio prior to moving to the US, Du Yinghong, a fellow artist who has known the brothers for nearly two decades, told CNN in a phone call.
     
            Due to the “deteriorating environment” in China, Gao Zhen relocated to New York two years ago when his son, an American citizen born in the US, reached school age, Gao Qiang said.
     
            The artist returned to China in June with his wife and son to visit family. “Before he set off, his friends and family — myself included — had all reminded him to consider whether it was safe to go,” Gao Qiang said. “He himself also thought he might encounter problems, but still, as if driven by fate, he went back.”

            At first, everything seemed fine. Gao Zhen kept in touch during his trip and regularly posted on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat. In July, he organized a birthday party for his son who had turned 6 years old.
     
            But on August 26, just over a week before the family was scheduled to fly back to the US, about 30 police raided the Gao Brothers’ studio in Yanjiao, a town on the border of Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, to “search for evidence,” Gao Qiang said.
     
            Police demanded the artist hand over his phone. Gao Zhen refused and was forcibly handcuffed and taken away, according to his brother.
     
            Gao Zhen’s wife received his detention notice the following day from the public security bureau in Sanhe, Gao Qiang said, adding that she had been warned by police not to speak to the media about her husband’s detention.
     
            The police returned to the studio on August 27 to search for more evidence, according to Gao Qiang.
     
            “A few days before his arrest, Gao Zhen told me that he was organizing his Yanjiao studio and had destroyed some unfinished sculptures in stock, including those of ‘Miss Mao,’” Gao Qiang said in an email.
     
            “He is nearly 70 years old and naturally prone to melancholy. I am very concerned about his physical and mental health.”
     
            Under Xi, the ruling Communist Party has vowed to eradicate “historical nihilism” — or any views that question or challenge its official version of history, including glorified images of sanctified national heroes.
     
            China passed a law in 2018 banning any insult or slander of national “heroes and martyrs,” including military personnel. The offense was added to the country’s criminal code three years later.
     
            Since then, the law has been used to jail a popular blogger who doubted the official death toll of Chinese soldiers in a border clash with India, and a former investigative journalist who questioned China’s role in the Korean War, as depicted in a patriotic movie.
     
            And last year, a stand-up comedian was investigated by police for the same offense after making a joke that referenced a military slogan at a show in Beijing. It cost him his job and his employer more than $2 million in fines, though police later dropped the case and did not press charges.
     
            Around that time, another Chinese contemporary artist, Yue Minjun, faced the wrath of online nationalists for “uglifying” and “insulting” China’s military with his iconic grinning self-portraits, but the authorities did not act on those accusations.
     
            That makes Gao Zhen the first Chinese artist known to be detained under the law.

            His brother and friends wonder why authorities appear to be targeting the Gaos’ works retroactively, as they were created many years before the law came into force.
     
            “The artworks collected as evidence by the police were all created more than a decade ago as part of an artistic reflection on Mao’s Cultural Revolution,” Gao Qiang said. “Imposing retroactive punishment for actions taken before the new law took effect goes against the widely accepted legal principle of non-retroactivity.”
     
            The Gaos hail from a generation of Chinese artists who pushed the boundaries of creative expression by offering an unflinching glimpse into the dark chapters of their country’s past.
     
            The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, which roiled China in the 1960s and 1970s, inflicted indelible pain on the Gao family.
     
            The brothers were just 6 and 12 years old when their father, a factory worker, was labeled a class enemy and thrown into detention at the height of the decade-long turmoil. Twenty-five days later, the family of six brothers was told that their father committed suicide “out of guilt for being a counter-revolutionary,” but they believed he was persecuted and killed.
     
            “Our father’s death was a devastating disaster for our family.” Gao Zhen told the Southern People Weekly, a once-outspoken news outlet, in 2010. “We constantly worried that our mother would take her own life, but she raised us with an extraordinary resilience that few could compare to.” After the Cultural Revolution ended, Gao Zhen took the train to Beijing to petition his father’s death. The family was eventually given about 3,000 yuan (then equivalent to about $2,000) in compensation, the Gao brothers wrote in an article in 2004.
     
            Friends who know the Gao Brothers say they used art to express their grief, with Mao being a recurring feature of their work in the late 1990s and 2000s.
     
            “It was really an artistic phase; it’s not all their work. But this is why people remember them, because it was a very political, very direct critique,” said a friend who has known the brothers for over two decades.
     
            In recent years, the brothers created works featuring world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, as well as pieces showing support for Ukraine, according to the friend, who requested anonymity over safety concerns.
     
            “There’s no logic to arrest (Gao Zhen) now,” she said. “They were not the only ones; many Chinese artists of that generation made very critical art back then… I guess they will be afraid now.”
     
            Even during China’s more liberal years, however, the brothers had several run-ins with authorities over their controversial artworks. Police shut down their exhibitions, confiscated their politically sensitive works, and even intimidated visitors by stationing guards outside their old studio in Beijing’s 798 art district.
     
            “But after we promised that our studio would not be open for public display, we hadn’t run into major problems,” Gao Qiang said.

            The duo went on to attract international acclaim. They held exhibitions in Paris, New York, Moscow and Berlin, with some of their works collected by prestigious museums, from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
     
            The two brothers obtained permanent residency in the US in 2011 and traveled frequently between Beijing and New York. Gao Qiang moved to the US a few years before his brother and has not returned to China since.
     
            Two years ago, their Beijing studio was forced to shut down, and Gao Zhen moved his studio to Yanjiao, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) away, his brother said.
     
            Gao Zhen’s detention shows that freedom of expression in China has shrunk significantly compared to a decade ago, Gao Qiang said.
     
            “A healthy society should move towards the broadening of thoughts and actions, instead of the other way around,” he added.

            Delegations from dozens of African countries are gathering in Beijing for a three-day summit set to see China showcase itself as a lead partner for the continent, despite slowing lending for its development – and as it faces rising frictions with the West.
     
            A procession of African leaders have arrived in the Chinese capital in recent days, greeted at the airport by honor guards and dance troupes with images flashed across state media, while Chinese officials have touted the gathering as the largest diplomatic event they’ve hosted in recent years.
     
            The fanfare comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has much to signal to his visiting counterparts, and the world, as the summit gets underway Wednesday.
     
            It is the first such gathering between Chinese and African leaders in the capital since 2018 and arrives at a critical juncture in ties between Beijing and a continent that’s home to its only overseas military base and where it has been the driving economic foreign power.
     
            In recent decades, free flowing Chinese funding has driven the construction of highways, rail lines and power plants across Africa. The financing has filled funding gaps and expanded China’s political influence, but also generated criticism it was saddling countries with unsustainable debt.
     
            Now, in the face of these concerns and its own economic slowdown, Xi and his officials will be likely pitching a new tune – what they posit as sustainable “small yet beautiful” investments and more collaboration on the green technologies in which China leads the world in producing.
     
            This week will be Beijing’s most high-profile chance to telegraph that vision, as it seeks to point the direction forward for ties with a continent whose political backing is only growing more important amid Beijing’s rising frictions with Washington – and for Xi’s aim to position China as a champion of the Global South and alternative leader to the US.
     
            How these changes play out for African leaders remains another question. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa bluntly called on China to “narrow the trade deficit and address the structure of our trade” during a bilateral meeting with Xi on Monday.
     
            A number of leaders attending the three-yearly Forum on China and Africa Cooperation are from countries grappling with heavy international debt, including from Chinese loans, and seek more investment and trade to boost their economies.
     
            They will likely probe whether a 2021 pledge from Xi to import products worth $300 billion from Africa by next year will be achieved. They’re also likely to press for ways to ensure growing trade is not merely an exchange of African raw materials for Chinese manufactured goods.
     
            “Critical questions are going to be asked –  and so African countries and their Chinese partners are going to be hard pressed to provide answers,” said Paul Nantulya, a senior China specialist at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
     
            When it comes to investment, even before the pandemic, China had already been reducing funding for the big-scale infrastructure projects that saw the world’s second largest economy become Africa’s largest bilateral creditor over recent decades.
     
            Chinese lending to African government or state-linked borrowers cratered during the pandemic, reaching a low of roughly $1 billion in 2022, according to Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The data showed a modest recovery to $4.6 billion in 2023, a far cry from a peak of more than $28.8 billion in 2016.
     
            Some African leaders holding talks in Beijing are facing steep challenges repaying debt from China and other lenders.
     
            Kenya, whose president, William Ruto, is in Beijing this week, was rocked by protests earlier this summer over a finance bill introduced by the government to rein in public debt. That debt includes nearly $6 billion owed to China and more than $20 billion payable to multilateral banks, according to an April government statement.
     
            Analysts say China is not the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, making up a comparatively small portion of the continent’s overall public debt. But the influx of Chinese loans increased the debt burden, and observers suggest China has moved too slowly or been inflexible in cases when it comes to helping countries that are heavily indebted to it get relief.
     
            Beijing has defended its lending practices and its efforts to ease debt repayment but is unlikely to make debt relief a major theme of the multilateral summit, where it will focus on trade measures and promoting what it says is a shift to “small yet beautiful” investments.
     
            The term, referring to projects with smaller budgets and environmental or social impact, has emerged as a key buzzword as Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). That’s as the infrastructure drive for the developing world transitions to a new phase following a decade of growth – that saw some projects slammed for environmental costs or poor labor standards and others stalled.
     
            “There will be fewer projects but a greater spotlight on them. In an ironic way, I think this will lead to a more sustainable path,” said Bhaso Ndzendze, an associate professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.
     
            But “the African side is keen to accept almost anything that China has to offer,” he continued, pointing to limited alternative avenues of support.
     
            Beijing is also expected to push to make Africa’s market a destination for its prolific production of green tech like solar panels and electric vehicles.
     
            The move may be welcomed by African nations grappling with power shortages and climate threat, but also comes as such Chinese goods face hefty tariffs in the US, Europe and Canada, as those markets move to block what they see as a flood of unfairly subsidized products.
     
            Past gatherings of the twenty-four-year-old forum have included big promises of financing and boosting bilateral trade. Beijing will now be keenly aware that its commitments face competition.
     
            In recent years, the US and its European partners have launched their own efforts to fund infrastructure in Africa, widely seen to be driven by their concern over China’s expansive footprint in the region – and its access to African critical minerals key for the fabrication of green tech.

            “Now (China) has competition on the street … so that also might trigger them to keep the momentum going on infrastructure, because they don’t want to cede that space to the US,” said Ammar A. Malik, a faculty affiliate in public policy at William & Mary, who monitors China’s overseas spending.
     
            Xi is also expected to use the gathering to project to the rest of the world the idea of solidarity between China’s view on the world and that of countries across Africa – a sign to Washington that despite pressure from the US and its allies, Beijing has numerous friends.
     
            Visiting leaders are likely to continue to endorse Xi’s cornerstone rhetoric around building a global “community with a shared future,” a vision he sees as unlike the one that’s been unfairly dominated by the West. Attendees could also express a unified opinion on global issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
     
            The forum has, in recent years, expanded beyond economic cooperation into areas like peace and security, alongside China’s own growing security interests in the region, where its companies’ sprawling mining operations have been subject to criminal attacks.
     
            “China-Africa relations is going back to the basics in the sense that it started as a political relationship,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined.
     
            Eguegu pointed to current Chinese Communist Party-funded initiatives to fund training for African political parties as well as African port calls from the People’s Liberation Army navy and joint military drills as part of a “ramping up of engagement in the political-security dimension.”
     
            “China is preparing its diplomatic relationships across the world at a time of increasing geopolitical tensions,” he said.

            The Chinese and Philippine Coast Guards traded blame over the latest collisions involving their vessels in the disputed South China Sea on Saturday.
     
            The Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) said a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship had “deliberately collided” with one of its vessels near the disputed Sabina Shoal, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            “At 12:06, the Philippine ship No. 9701 deliberately collided with the Chinese ship No. 5205, which was normally enforcing rights and law enforcement, in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, resulting in a collision. The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippines,” CCG spokesman Liu Dejun said on Saturday.
     
            PCG spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Chinese side had “deliberately rammed” a Philippines vessel.
     
            “This afternoon, the Chinese Coast Guard vessel deliberately rammed and collided with the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times, despite no provocation from the Philippine Coast Guard,” he wrote in a post on X.

            The dueling accounts come as Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions and face-offs over the past week near Sabina Shoal, also known as Xianbin Reef.
     
            The disputed atoll lies just 86 miles from the Philippines’ west coast and 745 miles from China.
     
            A spokesperson for the US State Department said it condemned China for “deliberately colliding three times” with the Philippine vessel.
     
            “On multiple occasions throughout August 2024, (China) has aggressively disrupted lawful Philippine aerial and maritime operations in the South China Sea, including at Sabina Shoal,” said the spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
     
            Miller added that the US called on China to comply with international law and “desist from dangerous and destabilizing conduct.”
     
            China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory despite an international ruling to the contrary.
     
            The escalation in tensions comes just weeks after Beijing and Manila struck a temporary deal to lower tensions that had been rising all summer at another nearby reef, where China’s increasingly aggressive tactics had raised alarm across the region as well as in Washington, a mutual defense ally of the Philippines.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with US national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Beijing Thursday as the two countries press ahead on stabilizing communication in their increasingly contentious relationship.
     
            The meeting was the capstone of a three-day trip that also saw Sullivan hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Central Military Commission vice chairman Gen. Zhang Youxia – the first meeting between a US official and Chinese military figure in that role since 2018.
     
            Xi said China’s “commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.
     
            The leader expressed “hope that the US side will work in the same direction with China, view China and its development in a positive and rational light, see each other’s development as an opportunity rather than a challenge,” the readout said.
     
            Sullivan in introductory remarks reiterated that US President Joe Biden is “committed to responsibly managing this consequential relationship to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.”
     
            He added that Biden looks forward to engaging with Xi again “in the coming weeks” – foreshadowing potential talks or a call between the two leaders, which were also referenced in both sides’ readouts of meetings between Sullivan and Foreign Minister Wang. Xi and Biden last spoke during a call in April.
     
            The meetings follow efforts over the past year from both sides to repair fractured lines of communication, even as US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
     
            Beijing has also been carefully watching the upcoming US elections, where a change of administration in January could impact the trajectory of the relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
     
            Expectations for significant progress on sticking points in the relationship during this meeting were low, especially as the US elections loom.
     
            “For both sides, they have no strong motivation to push aggressively … because of the election, both are in a ‘wait and see’ mode” while looking to maintain current relations without incident, said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor at the City University of Hong Kong.
     
            Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to maintain a level of continuity with Biden’s China policy, while Republican candidate Donald Trump had a combative and mercurial relationship with China as president and has threatened to broadly expand American tariffs on Chinese imports if re-elected.
     
            Wang and Sullivan also discussed plans to hold a call between their respective military theater commanders, both sides said.
     
            Such talks – part of a broader resumption of regular military discussions following a meeting between Biden and Xi in November – would involve commanders leading American troops in the Indo-Pacific and those leading Chinese strategy in the Southern and Eastern theater.
     
            The Biden administration has for months pushed to move direct discussions between the two global powers beyond the government brass to uniformed officers making decisions in the region. The call has not yet been scheduled, a US official told CNN.
     
            Wang and Sullivan’s discussion of military communication comes amid especially heightened tensions in the South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine ships have been engaged in a series of violent, but non-lethal confrontations in recent months.

A dangerous new flashpoint is fast emerging in the South China Sea
 
            Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Paparo earlier this week suggested the US could escort Philippine ships through the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety despite a major international ruling to the contrary.
     
            In his meeting Thursday with Zhang, a senior figure in China’s powerful Central Military Commission, Sullivan stressed “US commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea” and “the importance of cross-Strait peace and stability,” in reference to Taiwan, according to a White House readout.
     
            Sullivan also raised cyberspace, efforts to reach a ceasefire in the war in Gaza, and American concerns about what the US says is China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base as it wages war on Ukraine.
 
            In introductory remarks ahead of the meeting, which took place at Chinese military headquarters in Beijing, Sullivan acknowledged how “rare” it was to have such exchanges.
     
            “Given the state of the world and the need for us to responsibly manage US-China relations, I think it’s a very important meeting,” he told Zhang.
     
            Zhang called on the United States to “correct its strategic understanding of China, return to a rational and pragmatic policy toward China, (and) earnestly respect China’s core interests,” citing Taiwan as the “core of China’s core interests,” according to a readout published in Chinese state media.
     
            The general also called for both sides to “maintain stability in the military and security field.”
     
            Prior to those talks, Sullivan held two-days of engagements with Wang, marking the fifth time that the two officials have met over the past year and a half in multiple locations, including their last meeting in January in Bangkok.
     
            The two agreed to advance areas of cooperation, such as counternarcotics and AI safety and risk – but, as expected, made little leeway on major frictions in the relationship.
     
            Wang stressed the importance of US-China coexistence, while calling on the US to stop arming Taiwan and support China’s “reunification” with the island – a self-ruling democracy claimed by Beijing.
     
            The top Chinese diplomat also called on the US to “stop suppressing China in the fields of economy, trade, and science and technology,” calling American concerns about China’s manufacturing overcapacity “an excuse for protectionism.”
     
            Sullivan said the US would “continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced US technologies from being used to undermine our national security” and expressed concern about China’s “unfair trade policies.”

Could a Trump-Vance win reshape America’s relationship with China – and Taiwan?
 
            The Biden administration earlier this year announced it would maintain a set of sweeping import tariffs in place on Chinese goods — with significant increases on categories like semiconductors and electric vehicles expected to be implemented soon. It has also instated controls on Chinese access to American high-tech that could have dual-use civilian and military purposes.
     
            China has responded by limiting the export of certain materials key to produce high-tech goods.
     
            The US has also included Chinese entities in tranches of sanctions targeting Russia’s war machine, including a set released Friday. US officials have repeatedly warned that China’s exports of dual-use goods to Russia were supporting its defense industry and enabling Moscow’s war in Ukraine – a charge Beijing denies.
     
            Sullivan’s visit comes ahead of a series of high-profile multilateral summits in the coming months that could provide a platform for Biden and Xi to meet again in what would be the twilight of Biden’s presidency.

            A stretch of uninhabited, low-lying reefs in the South China Sea is fast becoming a dangerous new flashpoint between China and the Philippines, dealing a blow to recent efforts to de-escalate tensions in one of the world’s most vital waterways.
     
            Over the past week, Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions and face-offs near Sabina Shoal, a disputed atoll lying just 86 miles from the Philippines’ west coast and 745 miles from China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory despite an international ruling to the contrary.
     
            The violent confrontations came just weeks after Beijing and Manila struck a temporary deal to lower tensions that had been rising all summer at another nearby reef, where China’s increasingly aggressive tactics had raised alarm across the region as well as in Washington, a mutual defense ally of the Philippines.
     
            Renewed tension in the South China Sea is expected to be on the agenda of meetings between US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during Sullivan’s visit to China this week.
     
            Following a particularly violent encounter at the Second Thomas Shoal in June, which saw Chinese coast guard personnel brandishing axes at Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boats, Chinese and Philippine officials sat down for talks and agreed to de-escalate.
     
            For a while, tensions appeared to be cooling, but the detente proved short lived.
     
            On August 19, in the middle of the night, coast guard ships from China and the Philippines collided near Sabina Shoal. Manila said the Chinese ships rammed into its vessels, tearing a 3.6-foot hole in one and a 3-foot-wide gap in another. Beijing blamed the Philippines for the collisions.
     
            Then, on Sunday afternoon, another clash took place, with the Philippines accusing China of ramming and firing water cannons at a vessel from its fisheries bureau in an encounter with eight Chinese ships, including a warship from the People’s Liberation Army Navy. China said the Philippine ship “refused to accept control” by a Chinese coast guard vessel and “deliberately collided” with it.
     
            The following day, in yet another tense encounter, the Philippines said China deployed “an excessive force” of 40 ships – including three PLA Navy warships – to block two Philippine Coast Guard vessels. Beijing said it took “control measures” against two Philippine ships that “intruded” into waters near Sabina Shoal.
     
            Analysts say Sabina Shoal is fast becoming the latest confrontation zone in what is already a highly contested part of the world, where a mistake could quickly spiral into a conflict with hugely damaging consequences.
     
            “All indications seem to point to the fact that this is an emerging third flashpoint” after the Second Thomas Shoal and another atoll to the north named the Scarborough Shoal, said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
     
            “Manila is trying to avoid what they call a repeat of the Scarborough Shoal,” which China seized in 2012 after a long standoff with the Philippines and on which it has maintained a permanent presence since, Koh added.
     
            China, on the other hand, is trying to see off another Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippines ran aground a World War II-era ship in 1999 to stake its claim over the reef and has stationed a small group of marines since.
     
            The violent clashes around Second Thomas Shoal earlier this summer occurred during Beijing’s attempts to block Manila’s missions to resupply its soldiers stationed on the rusting BRP Sierra Madre.
     
            A similar blockade is playing out at Sabina Shoal, which is about 40 miles closer to the Philippine coast than the Second Thomas Shoal. Both lie within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Philippines.
     
            Since April, the Philippines has deployed a coast guard vessel to Sabina Shoal to monitor what it said were signs of China’s illegal land reclamation activities, after Filipino scientists discovered piles of crushed corals on the sandbars amid an increased presence of Chinese ships in the area. China has denied the accusation.
     
            Displacing 2,300 tons, the 318-foot-long BRP Teresa Magbanua anchored at Sabina Shoal is one of the two largest ships that the Philippine Coast Guard has and is its flagship. Acquired from Japan in 2022, it is also one of the newest ships in Manila’s fleet, carrying a crew of 67.
     
            “This has really annoyed China and they want that (Philippine) vessel to go away,” said Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.
     
            “China refers to it … as a ‘quasi-grounding,’ so they’re basically treating it like it’s the Sierra Madre all over again even though it is not grounded, it’s anchored.”
     
            And Beijing has been gradually upping the pressure on Manila.
     
            In July, China anchored one of its “monster” coast guard ships, the 12,000-ton CCG-5901, near Sabina Shoal. The CCG-5901 is more than five times the size of the Philippines’ Teresa Magbanua and larger than any other regular coast guard ship in the world.
     
            “Initially the Chinese were trying to warn Manila to roll back at Sabina Shoal. That’s why they send the monster ship just to create an impression,” Koh said.
     
            “But the Filipinos were sitting still and not moving at all. So I guess the Chinese likely have reached a point where they concluded that they need to up the pressure on the Filipinos, which is why we saw what’s happening recently.”
     
            In recent weeks, Chinese state media have accused the Philippines of trying to establish a long-term presence at Sabina Shoal to occupy the reef and indicated that China will not allow any resupply missions to proceed.
     
            “China will never be deceived by the Philippines again,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary about the Sunday faceoff, citing Manila’s grounding of the Sierra Madre at the Second Thomas Shoal back in 1999.
     
            On Monday, the Philippine Coast Guard said it had deployed two ships on a “humanitarian mission” to deliver vital food and supplies to its personnel stationed abroad the Teresa Magbanua, including “a special ice cream treat” in honor of the country’s National Heroes’ Day.
     
            (Teresa Magbanua, one of the heroes commemorated on the day, was one of the few women to lead Filipino troops in battles against Spanish colonizers during the Philippine Revolution and against American forces in the Philippine-American war.)
     
            But the mission failed due to the obstruction of 40 Chinese ships, according to the Philippine Coast Guard.
     
            If China continues to block the Philippines from resupplying the Teresa Magbanua with food, water and fuel or rotating its crew, the Philippine ship will have to sail away, Powell said.
     
            For now, neither Beijing nor Malina appear willing to back down.
     
            “It’s a high-stakes game for Manila,” Koh said. “The domestic circumstances all point to the very fact that now Sabina Shoal is where you could not yield an inch to the Chinese… Marcos Jr is definitely right on the chopping board for that,” he added, referring to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
     
            Since coming to power in 2022, Marcos Jr has strengthened Manila’s alliance with the US and increasingly challenged China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea, which an international tribunal said had no legal basis in a landmark ruling in 2016.
     
            His predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, a firebrand populist who launched a notoriously brutal anti-drug war, favored a much warmer relationship with Beijing and was much less willing to confront Beijing over the South China Sea.
     
            Manila’s current “transparency initiative” to expose China’s growing assertiveness in the disputed waters has won it international support, especially from Western countries, but Beijing is not deterred by negative press, Powell said.
     
            “China seems to be speeding up its agenda for taking control of West Philippine Sea features,” he said. “They have the capacity and they have the will, and they have not seen anything yet that says to them that the cost is going to be too high.”
     
            Meanwhile, both Beijing and Manila are watching closely for how Washington will react.
     
            American officials have repeatedly pledged to defend the Philippines from any armed attack in the disputed waters, stressing Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to a 1951 defense treaty between the two allies.
     
            Samuel Paparo, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, said Tuesday that American ships could escort Philippine vessels on resupply missions in the South China Sea, describing what he called an “an entirely reasonable option” that required consultation between the treaty allies, according to Reuters.
     
            But being dragged into another global conflict will not be in US interests, especially in the run-up to its presidential election, Koh said, adding that Washington is already occupied with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the raging war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
     
            “The Chinese know that Manila has very limited options if they could not depend on US help,” Koh said. “China is deliberately escalating the situation, with a likely intention to test how far Washington would support Manila.”

            IBM is cutting more than 1,000 jobs in China, according to multiple state media reports, as geopolitical tension between Beijing and Washington prompts many global companies to reassess their future in the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            Relations between the United States and China have deteriorated over technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and green technology, in part due to national security concerns. Some firms have quietly laid off or relocated staff.
     
            Yicai, a Chinese state-owned financial media outlet, reported on Monday that IBM (IBM) was closing its research operations in the country entirely. That included its China Development Lab, which opened 25 years ago in 1999, and the China Systems Lab, it said.
     
            In a statement sent to CNN on Tuesday, the company declined to comment on the number of job losses or whether it would retain any research staff in China.
     
            “IBM adapts its operations as needed to best serve our clients, and these changes will not impact our ability to support clients across Greater China region,” it said.
     
            Jiemian, another state-media outlet, wrote on Monday that the job cuts — which reportedly affected staff in Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian — were announced by Jack Hergenrother, an enterprise systems development executive.
     
            He reportedly told staff that IBM’s infrastructure business in China was “in decline” and the research work happening in the country would be transferred to other labs. The Wall Street Journal reported that some of the work may be undertaken by the company’s labs in India.
     
            IBM has a long history in China, having first supplied machines to a major hospital in the capital in 1934. After re-entering the market in 1984 following China’s opening to the world, the country was seen as a priority with massive potential.
     
            But in recent years, that enthusiasm has waned. A tech war between the world’s top two economic powers has intensified, making it increasingly difficult for American businesses to do business in China.
     
            “It’s a reality that market access for Western firms is constricting, if not closing in some sectors in China due to national security concerns,” David Hoffman, senior advisor of the Conference Board Asia, told CNN.
     
            He added that enterprise IT, which refer to complex systems used by large organizations to manage operations, was one of those areas, especially because large state-owned and state-connected firms form the bulk of the market.
     
            In the statement, IBM added that Chinese companies, especially privately owned firms, are increasingly focusing on hybrid cloud and AI technologies and that its strategy was to cater to those opportunities.
     
            After years as a growth market, China is no longer the promising bright spot it once was for a number of industries. IBM said in its most recent annual report that revenue in the country fell by 19.6% last year.
     
            The IBM news comes three months after Microsoft (MSFT) confirmed it had offered to relocate some of its employees in China. State media previously reported the company had made the offer to at least 100 staff.
     
            Like IBM, Microsoft has worked hard to build goodwill in China.
     
            It entered the market in 1992 and for decades counted on its influential research lab, Microsoft Research Lab Asia, to help it build influence. Its software is used by the Chinese government and companies, and Bing is the only foreign search engine with any traction in China.
     
            But it, too, has been facing challenges, as geopolitics cloud the business outlook for American companies working in AI and cloud computing research in China.
     
            Many US firms were persuaded by “Chinese incentives and bureaucratic urging” to move research into the country decades ago, according to Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research.
     
            “This was a key brag of the Chinese government for a long time. Now, political risk and IP [intellectual property] risk are reversing that trend,” she said.

            Japan says a Chinese military intelligence-gathering aircraft entered its territorial airspace off remote islands in the East China Sea on Monday, the first time Tokyo has accused the People’s Liberation Army Air Force of an airspace violation and a new irritant in frosty relations between China and Japan.
     
            A map released by the Japanese Defense Ministry showed the Chinese aircraft, a Y-9 reconnaissance plane, flying in a rectangular circuit pattern off the eastern side of the Danjo Islands when it briefly headed west and crossed into the islands’ territorial airspace – which extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of the islands – for about two minutes.
     
            The Japanese Defense Ministry said it scrambled Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets to respond to the alleged intrusion, but no confrontation with the Chinese plane was reported.
     
            Japan’s Foreign Ministry said it summoned Shi Yong, charge d’affairs of the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo, “to protest extremely severely and strongly request the prevention of a recurrence.”
     
            The Japanese military frequently scrambles fighter jets to confront Chinese military planes that approach but have not previously entered its territory, doing so 479 times – more than once a day – in the past fiscal year that ended in April, according to the Defense Ministry.
     
            But the alleged incursion into sovereign airspace brings that tension to a higher level.
     
            “In recent years, China’s military activities in the vicinity of our country have tended to expand and become more and more active,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a press conference Tuesday.
     
            “The invasion of our country’s airspace by Chinese military aircraft is not only a serious violation of our country’s sovereignty, but also a threat to our safety, and is completely unacceptable,” Hayashi said.
     
            CNN has asked Chinese authorities for comment on the Japanese allegations.
     
            The uninhabited Danjo Islands, a Japanese national monument and wildlife protection area, are in the East China Sea about 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the southwest of Nagasaki on the southern Japanese main island of Kyushu.

            While this was the first reported incidence of a Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force aircraft violating Japanese airspace, there have been two similar incidents in the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyus and claims as its sovereign territory, in the East China Sea.
     
            In 2012, a Chinese maritime surveillance plane entered airspace around the Senkakus and in 2017 a drone launched from a China Coast Guard vessel did the same, according to the Japanese government.
     
            But this week’s incident is the first time such an incursion has been attributed to a military plane.
     
            The uninhabited Senkaku chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years.
     
            Claims over the rocky islands, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China’s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals.

            Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims.
     
            It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims, including keeping a Chinese presence near the islands for a record 158 straight days earlier this year, according to the Japanese government.
     
            Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan’s mutual defense treaty with the United States.
     
            Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the pact.

            When China finally reopened its borders after years of Covid restrictions, Western airlines seemed poised to return to the once bustling market.
     
            Last year, foreign carriers scrambled to reinstate direct routes to the world’s second biggest economy, previously known for its export of lavishly spending tourists. Some even touted plans to boost flight schedules.
     
            But fast forward a year, the mood looks strikingly different.
     
            Several Western airlines are slashing flights they brought back just a year ago, with aviation industry analysts citing lukewarm demand due to China’s slumping economy.
     
            Higher operational costs and extended flight times incurred by Moscow’s war on Ukraine — as Western airlines skirt Russian airspace — have also squeezed their margins and made them less competitive than their Chinese rivals, which have benefited from a long-standing preference by domestic travelers for Chinese-speaking crew.
     
            Adding to those woes, tense geopolitics have dashed hopes for the full resumption of flights between China and the United States and some close Washington allies, as Western tourists mostly look elsewhere.
     
            “Foreign airlines did not recover international capacity to China as quickly as Chinese airlines recovered international capacity from China,” said Steve Saxon, a partner at McKinsey, who leads the consulting firm’s China research team on travel, logistics and infrastructure.
     
            “Even before reaching the pre-Covid levels, foreign airlines are now pulling back their flight capacity because they have more profitable opportunities elsewhere within their networks,” he added.
     
            Delta Air Lines (DEL) is among those carriers. The airline has confirmed to CNN that it has postponed plans to bring back its Los Angeles-Shanghai route due to “the slower recovery of the travel demand in the market.”
     
            British Airways will suspend its London service to Beijing, the Chinese capital, starting from October 26 until at least November 2025.
     
            It’s the same day on which Virgin Atlantic has scheduled its last flight from Shanghai to London. An airline spokesperson told CNN it was a “difficult decision” to suspend the route that launched 25 years ago. European airlines have so far been the worst hit because of the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Saxon said.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared a “no limits” partnership with Russia weeks before the full-scale invasion in February 2022 and set a policy of decrying sanctions and continuing to strengthen ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since the invasion, Chinese carriers have benefited from shorter northern routes to Europe and North America over Russia’s vast airspace.
     
            By contrast, airlines from other countries have been banned from Russian airspace or chosen to fly around it out of safety concerns.
     
            Saxon said the detour, sometimes also bypassing Ukraine airspace, can add up to three hours to flight times between Asian and European cities with a considerable bump in cost.

            “A flight from a European airline may cost an additional $8,000 to $10,000 in fuel for a two-hour increase in flight time,” he said, noting also greater crew costs and additional aircraft to maintain the service.
     
            That appears to be why Virgin Atlantic is pulling out. “Operations have become increasingly costly due to increased flight times as we are not able to overfly Russia,” it said in its statement to CNN sent earlier this month.
     
            The airline said it took two extra hours to fly from Shanghai to London, and an extra hour the way back.
     
            That put foreign airlines in a disadvantaged position. If offered a choice between a 10-hour flight and a 12-hour flight, it’s clear what the majority of travelers would choose, Saxon said.
     
            “People don’t enjoy spending time on board aircraft,” he added.
     
            Most China-bound flights from North America do not fly over Russia and the detour is relatively minor for those US airlines affected by airspace restrictions, according to Saxon.
     
            However, flights between the US and China have been subjected to carefully negotiated bilateral agreements.
     
            In late March, the US Department of Transportation raised the quota of weekly round trips that Chinese carriers can fly to and from the US to 50, up from 35 earlier this year.
     
            But it’s still a fraction of the more than 150 weekly round trips allowed by each side before curbs were imposed in early 2020 due to the coronavirus.
     
            The two countries have been clashing over a raft of issues from high-end semiconductors to disputes in the South China Sea.

            Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, which tracks the aviation industry, said relations between the world’s two biggest economies are “a critical part of the aviation industry” that cannot be ignored.
     
            “We are entering a very difficult phase with China and the Western world and there will definitely be implications which cannot be under emphasized because airline industry is a global industry,” he said.
     
            While airlines would like to think that they can strategize based solely on the business environment, Yusof said the reality is that the industry is also “driven by governments who have their own interests, especially for China.”
     
            He also said Beijing hasn’t done enough to actively lure back foreign tourists while encouraging Chinese citizens to fly with domestic carriers.
     
            As US airlines delay plans to resume China services, flag carrier Air China in March added two more flights from the Chinese capital to New York and one to Los Angeles. Other Chinese airlines have also increased their US flight frequencies.
     
            According to aviation analytics company Cirium, Chinese airlines have maxed our their allowed 50 flights in and out of the US per week, while the three US airlines that operate services to China – Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines – run just 35 flights.

            President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will visit China next week, sources say, to meet with the country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, as the United States works to keep the competition between the two countries from spilling into conflict.
     
            Sullivan is expected to depart early in the week for a multi-day visit in which he’s expected to meet with several top Chinese officials. A senior administration official said the trip will take place from August 27 to August 29.
     
            In recent years, Sullivan and Wang have structured meetings to take place regularly every six months to keep the lines of communication between the global superpowers open. The two officials, who have met five times, last met in Zurich in January. Since then, the Biden administration announced it would maintain a set of sweeping import tariffs in place on Chinese goods — with significant increases on categories like semiconductors and electrical vehicles expected to be implemented soon.
     
Axios first reported on Sullivan’s planned visit.
     
            Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping last met in person when San Francisco hosted the APEC Summit in November 2023. At that meeting, CNN previously reported, Xi promised Biden that Beijing would not interfere in the 2024 US election. Biden and Xi also spoke in April in what the White House described as a one-hour-45-minute “candid and constructive” conversation on a range of issues on which the leaders agreed and disagreed. In that April call, Biden stressed the need to maintain “peace and stability” across the Taiwan Strait and he also raised his concerns over China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, the White House said.
     
            Biden will attend a series of high-profile multilateral summits in the coming months at which he will be face-to-face with Xi, whom Biden has known for decades. Discussions for the two leaders to meet again are in their early stages, a US official tells CNN, and there is no certainty that an expanded bilateral meeting will take place in the twilight of Biden’s presidency.
     
            Leaders of countries participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, a bloc known as APEC, will gather in Peru in mid-November. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations will gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the days after that.

            Hungry tourists hiking on the Great Wall of China can now get their lunch delivered – from the air.
     
            Chinese food delivery giant Meituan says its new drone service, announced last week, will bring food, drinks and other goods such as medical supplies to customers at a far-flung section of the ancient monument on the outskirts of Beijing.
     
            It’s the capital’s first drone service, adding to a fast-growing drone delivery business across China, which is the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter of civilian consumer drones. The industry has brought convenience to people living in both cities and hard-to-reach rural areas.
     
            The Great Wall drone route extends from a nearby hotel rooftop to a watchtower on the southern extension of Badaling, the most popular section of the massive fortifications snaking across northern China.
     
            Opened last year, the extension, which has preserved the ruined state of the ramparts on the wall, typically experiences sweltering summer temperatures and has no commercial facilities.
     
            That’s where drones can help, according to Yan Yan, public affairs director of Meituan’s drone business.

            “Through drones, we can make trips that take 50 minutes on foot in five minutes and deliver heat relief items and emergency supplies to visitors,” she told state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            The drones can fly in moderate wind and rain and carry up to 2.3 kilograms (about 5 pounds) per trip, according to Meituan.
     
            The drone delivery fee is just 4 yuan (56 cents), the same as regular Meituan deliveries, state-run Beijing Youth Daily reported. The service will take orders from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., after which the drones will be tasked with carrying trash to recycling stations, the report said.
     
            But the drones still need human help.
     
            Once an order is received, a Meituan worker will pick it up from a nearby store and bring it to the hotel rooftop, where it will be weighed and packaged. An operator then attaches the package to the drone, which will fly on autopilot to the watchtower, where another worker waits to receive it.
     
            App users can then pick up their package from the worker at the watchtower.
     
            Drone delivery services have expanded rapidly in China in recent years.
     
            In 2016, e-commerce giant (JD) launched the first trial of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for deliveries in the countryside. Carrying up to 15 kilograms over a maximum distance of 20 kilometers (about 12 miles), those drones shortened delivery times from four hours by car on winding mountain roads to just under 20 minutes, state-run news agency Xinhua reported at the time.
     
            In addition to boosting rural logistics, drones are also increasingly used to fetch quick takeout for people living in China’s metropolises.
     
            Meituan completed its first drone delivery in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen in 2021. It now operates more than 30 drone routes in multiple cities, which have handled more than 300,000 orders, including in the financial hub of Shanghai.

            To navigate dense urban spaces, the drones follow predetermined routes from launch sites – usually rooftops – to pick-up points. Rather than hovering outside apartment or office windows, they drop off deliveries at kiosks near residential and office buildings, where customers can pick up their orders.
     
            Since last year, Meituan has also set up pickup kiosks for drone deliveries in public parks in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
     
            The expansion of drone delivery services comes amid a government push to develop the so-called “low-altitude economy,” referring to a wide range of businesses centered around manned and unmanned civil aerial vehicles below an altitude of 1,000 meters (3,281 feet).
     
            The “low-altitude economy” was identified as a new growth engine for the Chinese economy for the first time in the central government’s work report in March.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed “flourishing” trade ties with China during a meeting with a top Chinese official in Moscow as the two countries bolster their partnership in the face of mounting frictions with the West.
     
            Speaking to Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Putin said Russia-China “large-scale joint plans and projects” in economic and humanitarian areas would “continue for many years,” according to a Kremlin readout.
     
            Li, China’s No. 2 official under leader Xi Jinping, had traveled to Moscow for a longstanding annual meeting with Russia’s prime minister, which focused on economic and practical cooperation as the Kremlin continues to look to Beijing for economic partnership as its war with Ukraine grinds on.
     
            In his remarks to Putin, the Chinese premier hailed efforts by the Russian leader and Xi to “inject strong momentum” into “deepening bilateral relations and cooperation,” according to Chinese state media.
     
            Li’s four-day trip, which will include a stop in Russian ally Belarus, is the first visit to Russia by a high-level Chinese official since the Kremlin’s war with Ukraine took on a new dimension following a surprise, ongoing military incursion by Ukrainian forces into the Russian border region of Kursk two weeks ago.
     
            Russia has been scrambling to repel that assault, which marks the first time foreign troops entered Russian territory since World War II and comes amid mounting pressure for a conclusion to the war in Ukraine, which began in 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor.
     
            The Kremlin has become increasingly reliant on China’s market, goods and investment since the start of the war, when it was slapped with broad international sanctions – and both Moscow and Beijing see the other as a key counterweight against a West they see as seeking to suppress their development.

            In his meeting Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said China was ready to work with Russia to strengthen “all-round practical cooperation” and stressed that the countries’ relations did not “target any third party.”
     
            The two nominal heads of government agreed to expand bilateral economic and trade cooperation and pledged to oppose any attempt to restrict their “economic development, technological progress, and international development,” according to Chinese state media.
     
            “Certain countries” obstruct the “collective rise of emerging markets and developing countries,” the two officials said, using typical language to refer to their shared view on the United States and its allies.
     
            An official readout from the meeting released by China’s Foreign Ministry did not mention the war in Ukraine.
     
            Speaking to Li, Mishustin said Russia and China were “in a difficult external situation” as Western countries impose “illegitimate sanctions under far-fetched pretexts” and seek to “contain the economic and technological potential of Russia and China.”
     
            “That is why it is important to concentrate efforts on protecting our common interests, building a multipolar world order and strengthening coordination on international platforms,” he said, according to Russian state media.
     
            Beijing has faced mounting scrutiny and pressure from the West to curtail the export of dual-use goods such as aerospace, manufacturing and technology equipment to Russia, which Western leaders and Kyiv have alleged are propping up the Russian war effort.
     
            Chinese officials have sought to present the country as a neutral, aspiring peace broker in the war, but have had limited high-level contact with Kyiv while continuing to deepen relations with Moscow across trade, diplomacy and security.
     
            China last month hosted a top Ukrainian official for the first time since Russia’s invasion of the country nearly two and half years ago.
     
            Last week, in response to a media inquiry on the situation in Kursk, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry called on “all parties” not to expand the battlefield, escalate fighting and “fuel the flame,” saying China would continue to work for a “political settlement of the crisis.”
     
            Wednesday’s meeting between Li and Mishustin is part of annual talks held since 1996, typically focused on economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation and seen as a means to implement broader policy direction set by Xi and Putin.

            Following Wednesday’s talks, the two sides signed a host of cooperation documents in areas including science and technology, chemical industry, maritime search and rescue, and cross-border cargo transport, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Trade between China and Russia hit record highs last year, surpassing a target of $240 billion ahead of schedule. Russia has grown hugely reliant on China’s market, goods and investment since it was slapped with broad international sanctions following its Ukraine invasion.
     
            Bilateral trade increased by more than a quarter year-on-year in 2023 from 2022, but has only grown about 1.6% between January and July this year over the same period last year, according to China’s customs data.
     
            Li is expected to end his four-day trip in Belarus, where he will meet Belarusian Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko for an “in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields,” China’s Foreign Ministry said Monday.

            Beijing is investigating whether dairy producers in the European Union receive unfair government subsidies, marking the latest salvo in an escalating trade dispute.
     
            China’s Ministry of Commerce said Wednesday that local dairy producers had requested the probe, citing 20 different subsidy programs that may benefit the EU dairy industry. These ranged from financial support for farming equipment and supplementary income for young farmers to environmental and administrative subsidies.
     
            An initial review of the evidence had found sufficient grounds for an anti-subsidy investigation, the commerce ministry added in a statement. It noted that the investigation could take up to 18 months.
     
            The EU is among the world’s largest dairy exporters and China is the second-biggest destination for its skim-milk and whole-milk powders, according to European Commission data. The United Kingdom and United States are the top two recipients of the EU’s butter and cheese exports, with China coming in third and eighth place respectively.
     
            The announcement comes a day after the EU confirmed that it would move ahead with additional tariffs on most electric vehicles imported from China.

            Beijing and Brussels have been engaged in a back-and-forth trade row for much of the past year after the EU launched an investigation into China’s “unfair” state support for EV makers last September. The EU is also probing China’s support for wind turbine companies.
     
            China, for its part, has launched anti-dumping investigations into brandy and pork products from the EU.
     
            Olof Gill, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said in a statement Wednesday that the EU’s executive arm would follow Beijing’s investigation “very closely” and “intervene as appropriate” to ensure the probe complied with World Trade Organization rules.
     
            “The Commission will firmly defend the interests of the EU dairy industry and the common agricultural policy,” he added, referring to the bloc’s official program of support for farmers.

            “What are your parents’ names?”
     
            Fang, then a third grader, hemmed and hawed at the simple question as her teacher waited impatiently, unaware the 9-year-old was caught in a dilemma.
     
            Since preschool, Fang had been officially registered as the daughter of her eldest uncle – an attempt by her birth parents to circumvent harsh penalties for having a second baby under China’s controversial one-child policy that was enforced from 1980 to 2015.
     
            “I really had no idea which parents I was supposed to name,” Fang told CNN years later, using a pseudonym for privacy reasons.
     
            Since then, Beijing has gradually lifted the birth caps from one to two children, then to three in 2021, in a bid to arrest a looming demographic crisis.
     
            The one-child rules have gone, but the wounds of the past cast long shadows. A new generation of women like Fang, haunted by their parents’ struggles and their own sacrifices as children under the one-child policy, now eye parenthood with reluctance – making Beijing’s current pro-birth push a tough sell.
     
            Fang was born in the 1990s – when the one-child limit was at its strictest – and became a big sister just a year later, when her mother “illegally” became pregnant again. To avoid punishment, the family sent Fang to live with extended family members, while her mother pretended her second pregnancy was her first.
     
            Fang, now 30 and married, doesn’t want children at all.
     
            “All the fears, drifts and insecurity felt throughout my own childhood have, more or less, played a part in my current call,” she said.
     
            Keeping their firstborn secret spared Fang’s parents ruinous fines, job loss and even forced abortion and sterilization – the heavy price for having an “unauthorized” second child, another daughter.
     
            Fang was finally allowed to return home at age 10 – but was still registered as her eldest uncle’s daughter and told to “stick with her official registration” whenever she was asked about her parents.
     
            After the one-child policy was dismantled in 2015, Fang’s parents tried for another child. Fang sensed their unstated wish for a son, but her mother gave birth to a girl – her third.
     
            Over 30 years of China’s one-child policy, an estimated 20 million baby girls “disappeared” due to sex-selective abortions or infanticide, according to Li Shuzhuo, director of the Center for Population and Social Policy Research at China’s Xi’an Jiaotong University.
     
            Twenty-five-year-old Yao, the eldest of three siblings, shared a similar childhood marred by the policy and asked CNN to use only her surname for privacy reasons.
     
            She was born in a rural village in northeastern Shandong, one of the 19 provinces that allowed rural couples to have a second child – if their first was a girl – during the single child policy’s reign.
     
            This “one-and-a-half child policy” variant, introduced in 1984, reinforced the traditional Chinese preference for sons by implying that girls were worth “half” as much as boys, as noted in a leading Chinese academic study published last year.
     
            Yao’s first sibling was a girl – allowed under the policy – but then her mother fell pregnant with a third child – a forbidden one – and soon fled to another village with Yao’s sister, leaving Yao in the care of her grandparents.
     
            Yao said her mother was forced to keep her pregnancy secret to avoid a potential forced abortion. But after the “extra baby” arrived, she sought to officially register him as her son – and paid a crushing fine of 50,000 yuan (about $7,000).
     
            For Yao, it meant losing her mother’s companionship for nearly a year when she moved out to carry her son to term.
     
            “I was only a first grader then and had no one to walk me to and from school,” Yao recalled.
     
            “I felt all alone at that time.”
     
            CNN is unable to independently verify Fang’s and Yao’s accounts.
     
            Since the shift to a three-child policy in 2021, Beijing has been running national campaigns to foster a “pro-birth culture” as China’s population shrinks and grays at an alarming rate.
     
            Posters and slogans once warning of the perils of having more than one child have been replaced with ones encouraging more births. Local governments have rolled out a flurry of policy incentives, from cash handouts and real estate subsidies to the extension of maternity leave.
     
            The policy U-turn, from birth limits to birth boost, has left Yao “speechless.”
     
            “How ‘well-planned’ the family-planning policy is!” Yao mocked. “(The government) used to slap us for having two (babies) and now expects us to have three?”
     
            Fang said she was “somewhat nettled” by Beijing’s initiatives to spur births, arguing: “Having kids or not is purely a woman’s personal choice, not out of any policy, be it a stick or a carrot.”
     
            In May, China’s National Health Commission issued a dozen “birth-friendly theme posters” to local bureaus, calling for a “widespread dissemination” from social media to community parks.
     
            The move was met with wry comments online, referencing past one-child slogans like “Fewer kids, happier lives,” and, “If you want to be rich, have fewer children and plant more trees.”
     
            These chants are not just recounted for ridicule – people have found new resonance with the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s old teachings and are now acting on them earnestly.
     
            Last year, the country’s total fertility rate (TFR) – meaning the average number of children a woman delivers during her reproductive years – stood at around 1.0, according to the 2024 China Birth Report from the YuWa Population Research Institute, a China-based think tank.
     
            That’s far lower than the 2.1 rate needed to maintain a stable population, or the “replacement rate” in demographic terms, and ranks as the second lowest among the world’s major economies.
     
            The birth deficit is even grimmer in China’s richest city, Shanghai, where roughly half of all women do not have children throughout their reproductive periods, based on the city’s 2023 TFR figure (0.6) announced in May.
     
            Yi Fuxian, an expert on China’s demographics at the University of Wisconsin, says the country faces three major obstacles to reversing its shrinking population: low fertility desire, high child-raising costs and a climbing infertility rate.
     
            Of these, “the sole challenge Beijing has any capacity to impact is the affordability issue,” Yi said.
     
            Last month, the Communist Party proposed boosting incentives, including childbirth subsidies and more affordable childcare, at a key meeting of party leaders.

            Yet, debt-stricken local governments – including many that are struggling to recover from three years of strict pandemic controls and a loss of revenue from a real estate crash – can only carry them out on a shoestring budget, dooming the party’s birth boost attempt, according to Yi.
     
            Chinese state-run media outlet Jiemian reported in early June that the highest childcare subsidies nationwide amount to only 57,800 yuan (about $8,000) – a drop in the bucket for one of the world’s priciest countries to raise kids.
 
            The cost of raising a child to age 18 in China is 6.3 times its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita - second only to its neighbor South Korea at 7.79 times, according to a YuWa report.
     
            The hefty price tag means some people are putting off parenthood until later in life, when their fertility and openness to child-rearing might be on the wane.
     
            “China has fallen into a ‘low-fertility trap’ and the figure will only dip further,” warned Yi.
     
            A “low fertility trap” describes a self-reinforcing cycle, where low fertility rates (typically under 1.5) drive population aging and economic stagnation – which further deter childbearing and sink the figure even lower.
     
            “China’s fertility rate should have been falling naturally as its economy advances, like a giant rock gradually rolling down along a hillside,” Yi said. “But the one-child policy kicked the rock right down the cliff – it’s extremely hard to lift the rock back now.”
     
            Online discussions in China about childbirth decisions are often dominated by economic concerns, but some have also thrown shade at the country’s one-child policy by sharing decades-old receipts for over-quota birth fines on Xiaohongshu, China’s version of Instagram.
     
            “Childbearing isn’t just a financial matter,” said Lü Pin, a prominent Chinese feminist.
     
            “Coercive family planning, as a form of state violence, has scarred women deeply … and people just haven’t got over it yet,” added Lü, who’s pursuing a doctorate in women and politics at Rutgers University in the United States.
     
            Forced abortion and sterilization, arguably the most ghoulish facet of China’s one-child “social engineering,” have left an indelible mark on hundreds of millions of Chinese women, physically and mentally.
     
            According to state-owned news outlet The Paper, between 1980 and 2014, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with intrauterine devices (IUDs) and 107 million underwent tubal ligations to prevent pregnancy.
     
            Decades after the one-child policy’s introduction in 1980, those contraceptive devices – only meant to remain in women’s bodies for five to 20 years – have long outlived their safe stay.
     
            But family planning officials, who once had performance targets to push women to fit IUDs after having their first child, now lack similar incentives to remove those devices in a timely manner, demographer Sun Xiaoming told The Beijing News, a state-linked newspaper.
     
            “The government has stretched its hands far enough – even into common folks’ bodies!” Yi said.
     
            Lü added that Beijing had not conducted any “open self-reflection, nor even admission (of the state-inflicted trauma).”
     
            “Now it expects women to forget all this and embrace its lurch to birth boost? Fat chance.”

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            During China’s go-go years, young couples holding enormous bouquets of roses were a familiar sight during the Qixi Festival, an ancient holiday celebrating love and loyalty.
     
            People would flock to social media to show off brand-new iPhones and Louis Vuitton handbags gifted by their partners, as well as photos of dinners at fancy restaurants, during the Chinese version of Valentine’s Day, which typically falls in July or August each year.
     
            That was when China’s economic growth was the envy of the world. This year’s festival was on Saturday, and it was a very different story. People went online to complain about the lack of gift giving and festive spirit, citing a sluggish economy and tough job market.
     
            The hashtag “consumption plummets on Chinese Valentine’s Day. Are young people unwilling to pay the love tax?” became the No 1 trending topic on the Weibo platform on Saturday, drawing 200 million views.
     
            “The Qixi Festival is not as robust as previous years. It feels almost desolate,” one user wrote.
     
            Owners of some flower shops took to Xiaohongshu, another popular platform, to bemoan the lack of customers, posting images of unsold roses lining their stores. CNN was not able to independently confirm their claims.
     
            Other posts recalled forlornly that couples used to have money to spend when the world’s second largest economy was doing well. China is currently plagued by a litany of woes from sluggish consumer spending  to a persistent property slump and a mounting debt crisis.
 
            Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said that young people, who used to be big spenders during Qixi, are struggling to find jobs.
     
            “I think the overall sentiment is very bad and consumers are very conservative,” he said, adding that the negative sentiment has become “the overall pattern” and “not just one festival.”
     
            The anecdotal drop in spending appears to align with the “weak-consumption trend witnessed over the past two years,” said market strategist Yeap Jun Rong from trading provider IG, adding that China’s consumer confidence is “hovering around its record low.”
     
            On Thursday, a glimmer of hope came from official data showing retail sales, a measure of consumption, rising 2.7% in July, slightly beating a forecast of 2.6% cited by Reuters.
     
            However, the price of new homes fell 4.9% last month, hitting a fresh 9-year low, according to the news agency. The figure has been down for 13 straight months, it said. Housing prices are a key metric to watch because about 70% of Chinese household wealth is tied to property, which in turns affects spending.
     
            How China’s lovers behave is an issue for global businesses — and the government in Beijing. In recent weeks, a number of Western multinationals, from cosmetics giant L’Oreal to carmaker Volkswagen, have sounded the alarm over weak demand in China as consumer confidence remains in the doldrums.
     
            The lackluster mood is also affecting the Chinese government’s efforts to encourage marriage as a way of addressing falling birth rates and an aging population. A shrinking population is likely to be a drag on economic growth.
     
            In the first half of 2024, just 3.43 million couples got married, half the number recorded for the same period 10 years ago, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
     
            On Saturday, state broadcaster CCTV released a video featuring rare family portraits of a young Chinese leader Xi Jinping, his wife Peng Liyuan and their baby daughter to celebrate their marriage, which spanned more than three decades.
     
            But the message failed to convince, with people complaining on social media about not being able to start a family because they owed money or have to work long work hours.
     
            “When people born after 1990 are now in [tens of thousands of yuan of] debt, as ‘996007’ becomes the norm, where do people find the mood to date?” the Weibo user asked.
     
            “996” and “007” refer to the notorious work hours demanded by some of China’s biggest conglomerates. The former refers to workers toiling away from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. Some are in a “007” situation, meaning they work every day.
     
            The general pessimism is showing up in trade and other data. According to a CNN calculation based on official customs data, imports of jewellery-grade diamonds in the first half of this year declined by 28% compared to the same period in 2023.
     
            Diamond supplier De Beers said in its 2024 semi-annual report that “ongoing economic challenges” in China have delayed the expected recovery from a sharp decline in 2023.
     
            And according to data released last Friday by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s direct investment liabilities, a measure of foreign direct investment into the country, dropped by almost $15 billion in the April to June quarter. That’s only the second time this has happened since 1998, underscoring the country’s failure to stem an outflow of capital.
     
            Qixi, which has been celebrated for thousands of years, falls on the seventh day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar. (Most of the world uses the solar, or Gregorian, calendar.) According to legend, it is the one day a year that mythical lovers Niulang, a cow herd, and Zhinu, a weaver, are able to meet on a celestial bridge.
     
            In previous years, it was a fertile opportunity for Chinese and Western companies to market their wares. But that has changed. Global CEOs are no longer able to count on China as a commercial stalwart.
     
            “The only part of the world where consumer confidence remains very low is China,” L’Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus told analysts on an earnings call late last month.
     
            He cited the weak job market and real estate woes as reasons for the malaise. Lower-than-expected growth in the global beauty sector this year is largely a consequence of low consumer confidence in China, he added.
     
            Advertising agency WPP (WPP) said last week that second-quarter revenue in China plunged almost a quarter on the previous year — and the outlook is not much better.
     
            “I’m expecting the second half to remain very challenging in China,” Chief Financial Officer Joanne Wilson added on an earnings call. “I expect for the full year that (revenue) will be down double digits.”
     
            Volkswagen and Mercedes were similarly glum in their assessment of China’s economy.
     
            “I think everybody knows that since we came out of the Covid restrictions beginning of last year, consumer sentiment, it didn’t come back,” Mercedes Benz Group chairman Ola Kaellenius told analysts on July 26. “We don’t know how long it will take, what it will take for China’s consumers to regain that confidence.”

            The United States and Europe are racing to narrow China’s commanding lead in clean energy technologies, throwing subsidies at local manufacturers and hiking tariffs on Chinese imports in a strikingly protectionist turn.
     
            China’s dominance in clean energy supply chains presents a conundrum for governments trying to green their economies and meet fast-approaching climate targets while protecting entire industries and thousands of jobs from a flood of cheap imports.
     
            Without China’s electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries, reducing planet-heating pollution could take longer and ultimately increase costs for businesses and consumers.
     
            But the West needs to avoid repeating Europe’s mistake of becoming overdependent on a single supplier — Russia — for cheap gas and wants the economic rewards that come from developing its own technologies of the future.
     
            “We saw the playbook for how China came to dominate the solar panel industry… granting massive subsidies for domestic suppliers, while… closing the domestic market to foreign businesses,” the European Union’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in April as she announced a probe into Chinese wind turbine makers. “The result is that nowadays less than 3% of the solar panels installed in the EU are produced in Europe.”
     
            “We can’t afford to see what happened on solar panels happening again on electric vehicles, wind, or essential chips,” she added.
     
            Rising global competition in green technologies is increasing tensions between China — the world’s biggest manufacturer — and its major trading partners. The US and the EU have adopted a tough stance on imports from China, with Washington hiking tariffs not just on the country’s EVs, but also batteries, solar panels, and critical minerals.
     
            “The competition for position in the clean energy economy is fierce, because it is not necessarily only about climate change concerns,” Fatih Birol, the CEO of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told reporters on a recent call.
     
            “It is driven by industrial policy concerns: who will get what kind of position in the next chapter of industrial technology.”
     
            For now, China is leading the race. Last year, the country accounted for three-quarters of global investment into clean technology manufacturing, although that’s down from 85% in 2022, according to the IEA.
     
            This year, it is on track to invest $676 billion in clean energy overall amid robust demand for solar panels, lithium batteries and EVs. That’s more than double the US’s projected $315 billion investment and way ahead of the EU’s $370 billion.
     
            Those huge investments have turned China into the world’s biggest and lowest-cost supplier of many of the technologies and critical minerals needed for the clean energy transition.
     
            According to the IEA, Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide last year. Global manufacturing capacity for EV and industrial-use batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels is also concentrated in China.
     
            A similar picture emerges when it comes to the critical minerals essential for EVs and other green technologies. Over half of global processing of lithium and cobalt takes place in China, as does almost all refining of graphite, used in EVs, and of rare earths, crucial for generators on wind turbines.
     
            Beijing’s virtual monopoly on the processing of some critical minerals comes with particular risks for the global green transition. Last year, China slapped export controls on gallium and germanium — rare earths essential for manufacturing semiconductors — in response to restrictions by the US, the Netherlands, and Japan on the exports of some semiconductor equipment to China.
     
            Beijing also later tightened its grip on the supply of graphite, used in EVs.
     
            The world’s second-biggest economy has made no secret of the fact that it wants to export more of the country’s “new trio” of products — namely, EVs, lithium batteries, and solar panels.
     
            But announcing substantial increases in tariffs on EVs from China in June, the EU’s executive body said: “The EU’s green transition cannot be based on unfair (subsidized) imports at the expense of EU industry.”
     
            While tariffs may protect local manufacturers, experts say they could harm the shift to green energy, as well as increase costs for businesses.
     
            “There is no question that the world has become too dependent on China, especially in the raw ingredients of the clean energy economy,” academics David G. Victor and Michael R. Davidson write in a recent Brookings paper. “But the right way to respond to Chinese dominance isn’t with extensive tariffs.”
     
            They argue that tariffs “across whole industries,” such as those adopted by Washington, drive up the cost of Chinese imports, making it “harder for anyone who wants to use solar panels or batteries to reduce emissions.”
     
            Trying to go green without China “will slow down the (energy) transition,” Victor, a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California San Diego, told CNN. “It’s bad for the environment.”
     
            Similarly, last month, International Monetary Fund chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas warned that the recent “surge” in tariffs and other protectionist measures could “make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition.”
     
            Any delay in switching to clean energy will exact a heavy toll on the planet. According to a report published Wednesday by the McKinsey Global Institute, deployment of low-emissions technologies around the world is only at about 10% of the level required to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — a target that scientists say the world must hit to avoid catastrophic climate change.
     
            In the meantime, the costs of climate change keep mounting — most obviously through more frequent and intense natural disasters — and the poorest countries are being hit hardest.
     
            To protect both the environment and local jobs, Western policymakers should focus their measures on areas where there are genuine national security concerns, according to Victor of University of California San Diego.
     
            “That’s a pretty narrow list,” he said, citing the production of advanced semiconductors and some artificial intelligence technologies.

            “It doesn’t include aluminum manufacturing, copper refining, (or) the lithium supply chain… We need to radically reduce the onshoring (and friendshoring) requirements for critical minerals,” he added, referring to rules that require goods to be sourced locally or from allies.
     
            Governments should also direct investment to innovation and emerging technologies, rather than subsidize established industries, including solar and wind, as the US Inflation Reduction Act has done, Victor added.
     
            When it comes to the minerals needed for green technologies, “we should do what we do in all commodity markets, which is have diversity (of supply),” he said.
     
            Birol at the IEA also advocates for trade policies that diversify supply chains while reducing the risk of delays to the clean energy transition.
     
            “Currently there is a big concentration of the battery manufacturing, and this is an important challenge for countries for energy security (reasons), for competitiveness (reasons) and others,” he said.
     
            The IEA strongly supports diversification when it comes to energy sources and trade partners, Birol also said. “You don’t put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to energy.”

China is celebrating its best-ever performance at an overseas Olympics after winning the same number of golds as the United States at the Paris 2024 Games.
     
            Both countries finished with 40 golds, marking the first ever tie for total golds at the Summer Games – but the US claimed top spot overall with 126 medals to China’s 91.
     
            The race was dramatically close as the two sporting superpowers went head-to-head in yet another aspect of their geopolitical rivalry in a Games that was at times overshadowed by a doping controversy.
     
            China has become one of the world’s most competitive sporting nations in recent decades, seeing its Olympic performance as a symbol of national strength. In 2008, it topped the gold medal table at the Beijing Games, surpassing the US for the first time.
     
            In Paris, the Chinese team appeared on course to top the medal table as it built up a sizable early lead over Team USA, thanks to its domination in shooting and diving. But as track and field events got underway, the US quickly caught up – then eventually overtook its rival.
     
            China is only the third country after the US and the former Soviet Union to top the gold medal count at a Summer Olympics away from home soil – and Chinese state media hailed the “record-breaking” haul from Paris.

            “Chinese analysts said this proves that the success of Chinese modernization can bring not only economic growth, but also can benefit the development of public health, as well as the environment for sports industries, to effectively energize ‘sports for all,’” the state-run Global Times said.
     
            Chinese social media also celebrated the team’s performance with a burst of national pride, with many users criticizing what they said was as an unfair attempt by US officials to smear China with persistent doping allegations against its swim team.
     
            On microblogging site Weibo, the hashtag “China tied for first place on the gold medal leaderboard” became the top trending topic, racking up more than 500 million views.
     
            “We won every gold medal square and fair!” said a top comment with over 28,000 likes.
     
            Others argued China should have surpassed the US with a total of 44 golds by adding the medals from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
     
            Taiwan competes at the Olympics as Chinese Taipei to avoid objections from China, whose ruling Communist Party claims the democratically governed island as its own territory despite having never controlled it.
     
            Hong Kong, a former British colony, competes as Hong Kong, China at the Olympics.
     
            China’s swim team faced intense scrutiny in Paris following revelations that nearly half the group that Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing substance.
     
            The swimmers had been cleared by the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for a banned heart medication were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.
     
            The accusations, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, have sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules.
     
            Concern only deepened last month, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for trace amounts of a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by Chinese officials – again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.

            In China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the doping allegations brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment – with many seeing it as an attempt by the US to sabotage the Chinese team at the Games.
     
            The Chinese Embassy in Washington accused the US of “using the doping issue to smear and suppress China,” while CHINADA and state media have accused the US of “double standards” in handling drugs scandals.
     
            Last week, CHINADA called for more intensive testing of American track and field athletes, citing past doping controversies in the US – and highlighting the case of sprinter Erriyon Knighton, who finished fourth in the men’s 200-meters in Paris.
     
            Knighton was provisionally suspended after testing positive for a banned substance in March, but he was cleared to compete in Paris after an independent arbitrator determined his failed drug test was “more likely than not” caused by contaminated meat, according to the US Anti-Doping Agency.
     
            On Monday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV posted an article on social media with the headline: “The Olympics Games have ended, but the shocking questions about the ‘United States of Addicts’ cannot be left unanswered.”
     
            “The next Olympics will be held in Los Angeles, USA. To restore the world’s confidence in American sports, the US owes an explanation to the world,” the article said.

            Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate has a decades-long connection with China. But in the eyes of Beijing, that may not necessarily be good news.
     
            Tim Walz moved to China fresh out of college in 1989 to teach high school for a year, and then frequently returned to the country during a decade of taking American students on summer cultural exchanges.
     
            The 60-year-old Minnesota governor has spoken fondly of his time in China and the people he met there, and his familiarity with the country and empathy for its people bring a personal, nuanced perspective on the United States’ biggest strategic rival that is rare among his political peers.
     
            Some Republican opponents have seized on that experience to accuse Walz of being “pro-China,” but the Democratic vice-presidential nominee has a long history of criticizing authoritarian Chinese leadership.
     
            Walz moved to China at a tumultuous and politically charged time, shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre, when the ruling Communist Party sent tanks in to violently quell peaceful student-led democracy protests in Beijing. Upon returning home to Nebraska in 1990, he told a local newspaper he felt the Chinese people had been mistreated by their government for years.
     
            “If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they could accomplish. They are such kind, generous, capable people,” he told the Star-Herald at the time.
     
            During his time in Congress from 2007 to 2019, Walz rallied support for imprisoned Chinese activists. He met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader loathed by Beijing, and Joshua Wong, the young Hong Kong democracy activist now jailed for his activism against Beijing’s tightening grip.
     
            “The more he understands China, the more he feels pity for the Chinese people, and the more critical he becomes of the rulers who govern them,” said Shen Dingli, a foreign policy analyst in Shanghai.
     
            “He has some understanding of Chinese culture and respects it in his heart, but he definitely does not accept China’s political (system),” Shen added. “Beijing is probably more fearful and uncomfortable with such a foreigner who understands China.”
     
            Walz was among the first groups of young Americans to teach in high schools in China under a Harvard University volunteer program, just a decade after the two countries established diplomatic relations.
     
            As a fresh graduate, he spent a year teaching English and American history at the Foshan No. 1 High School, in the southern province of Guangdong.
     
            There, he was met with industrious and welcoming students who applauded him each time he used a Chinese word correctly, and friendly strangers who offered to help whenever he stopped in the streets looking bewildered, he told the Star-Herald in 1990.
     
            “I was treated exceptionally well,” he told the newspaper. “There was no anti-American feeling whatsoever. American is ‘It’ in the eyes of the Chinese. Many of the students want to come to America to study.”
     
            That was a different era in China. The impoverished country was curious about the world after emerging from decades of self-imposed isolation and tumultuous rule under Mao Zedong. Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping unleashed market reforms and, along with an economic opening, calls for political liberalization gathered pace in the 1980s.
     
            Such calls coalesced into a student-led movement in the spring of 1989, which was brutally put down by the Chinese military weeks before Walz’s trip.
     
            “I remember waking up and seeing the news on June 4 that the unthinkable had happened,” Walz told Voice of America in an interview in 2014.
     
            “Many of my colleagues decided to go home and not to go on [to China]. I thought it was more important than ever to go, to make sure the story was told and to let the Chinese people know we were standing there, we were with them.”
     
            From Guangdong, Walz took a 40-hour cross-country train ride to the Chinese capital to see Tiananmen Square, the site of the democracy protests.
     
            He made sure he would always commemorate the crackdown in a personal way – by getting married on June 4, 1994, the fifth anniversary of the massacre.
     
            “He wanted to have a date he’ll always remember,” his wife and fellow high-school teacher, Gwen, told a local newspaper in Minnesota before their wedding.
     
            The newlyweds spent their honeymoon taking students on two-week tours in China for sightseeing and classes on culture, education and history. These trips became a summer tradition for the couple through 2003.
     
            “I would go back in a heartbeat,” said Cara Roemhildt, who went on such a trip in 1998. “It was an educational trip with one of our favorite teachers. It was more about the people. It wasn’t about the politics.”
     
            Roemhildt said she and her classmates still talk about the trip decades later.
     
            “It felt very, very comfortable. And we went all over…Train rides (to) a whole bunch of different places,” she told CNN. “Just seeing a different culture and having respect for it while seeing it. Knowing that it’s different, but knowing that it’s okay, too.”
     
            After entering politics in 2006, Walz continued to devote time and attention to China in Congress.
     
            He served more than a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which monitors human rights and the rule of law in the country – a role Beijing would not be happy about.
     
            “The Chinese government has always viewed that commission as ‘anti-China,’” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at the City University of Hong Kong.
     
            In Congress, Walz co-sponsored a series of resolutions calling on China to release its jailed rights activists, including Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, who eventually died in custody of liver cancer.
     
            In 2015, Walz joined a congressional delegation on a trip to China, which included a rare stop in Tibet, which he had also visited decades earlier during his time teaching at the Chinese high school.
     
            The following year, Walz met the Dalai Lama in Washington for what he called a “life-changing lunch.” He also welcomed Lobsang Sangay, then leader of Tibet’s government in exile, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-school students.
     
            At a congressional meeting that year, he called on Beijing to “ensure the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture” and “provide less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans.”
     
            Walz has also been a vocal supporter of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.
     
            In 2017, when Wong, the student protest leader, was jailed for his political activism, Walz posted a photo of himself and the young activist standing side by side to show solidarity with “all advocating for democracy in Hong Kong.”
     
            Walz also threw his support behind the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which sanctions officials responsible for human rights violations in the city, when the legislation appeared to be languishing in Congress.
     
            “We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum. Only Walz answered his,” Jeffrey Ngo, a Hong Kong democracy activist now based in Washington, said on X.
     
            “Walz is perhaps the most solid candidate when it comes to human rights and China on a major-party ticket in recent memory,” Ngo said.
     
            On the diplomatic front, Walz has criticized China’s unfair trade practices and its growing assertiveness in the South China Sea.
     
            In Chinese nationalist circles, which have an outsized voice on policy debates in China, there are no rosy illusions about Walz.
     
            “On human rights and ideological issues, he has basically crossed all the possible red lines out there,” Shen Yi, an international relations scholar known for his fiercely nationalistic views, wrote on social media.
     
            But unlike more hawkish politicians, Walz does not believe in decoupling, and instead holds a more nuanced view on the geostrategic rivalry between the US and China.
     
            “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship. I totally disagree,” he said in an interview in 2016.
     
            “We’re on the same sheet of music, two of the world’s great superpowers, there’s many collaborative things we can do together.”
     
            Stephen Roach, former chief of Morgan Stanley Asia, said the Harris-Walz ticket may provide “an important counterweight to the current venom of American Sinophobia.”
     
            Walz’s empathy for the Chinese people and appreciation of China’s non-political aspects make him a harder case for Beijing to “villainize as an ‘anti-China’ foil” than politicians that are hawkish on all dimensions, Eric Fish, a former Beijing-based journalist and author of “China’s Millennials: The Want Generation,” said on X.
     
            Walz’s extensive experience with China makes him a rare figure in the race for the White House – at least since George H. W. Bush, who served as America’s unofficial ambassador to Beijing in the mid-1970s before running for vice president and later president.
     
            Bush’s stint in Beijing would go on to influence his foreign policy – and help steer US-China relations through the tumultuous fallout of the Tiananmen crackdown.
     
            But US-China relations are at a very different place now from the honeymoon period of engagement. Being tough on China has become a rare point of bipartisan consensus in the US, and Beijing is unlikely to be counting on Walz to improve bilateral ties.
     
            “The direction of US policy towards China is very clear. As an individual, regardless of your attitude towards China, there’s not much room for maneuver,” said Liu, the expert at the City University of Hong Kong.
     
            “And vice presidents can have a varied level of say in foreign policy, depending on the president they serve,” he added.
     
            Walz’s experience living and teaching in China could serve as a useful diplomatic ice breaker to warm up the room if that’s what the two sides wish to do, Liu said. But even then, he added, the Chinese would need to dance around the awkwardness in the timing and avoid all mention of the Tiananmen crackdown – which remains a political taboo in China.
     
            On China’s tightly controlled social media, Walz’s early ties to the country have raised eyebrows and generated considerable interest. The hashtag “Harris’ VP pick once taught in China” racked up 15 million views on microblogging site Weibo.
     
            The year of Walz’s arrival in China – 1989 – was not lost among those who understand the sensitivity of the date, despite decades of effort by the Chinese government to erase the brutal crackdown from public memory.
     
            But, perhaps reflective of the different era China now finds itself in under leader Xi Jinping, who has fanned nationalist sentiment and suspicion against foreigners over national security, many questioned the “real motive” of Walz’s first trip to China.
     
            “Heh, 1989-1990, Americans teaching in China during this period – it’s something worth pondering carefully,” said a top comment on Weibo.
     
            “Must be a spy,” said another.
     
            Liu said that, given how drastically China has changed over the past decades, Walz’s understanding of the country from his younger days may offer limited help on American policy toward China today.
     
            Walz himself has conceded that he’s by no means a China expert.
     
            “I lived in China, and as I said I’ve been there about 30 times,” he said in the 2016 interview. “But if someone tells you they’re an expert on China, they’re probably not telling you the truth because it’s a complex country.”

            One of China’s Long March 6A rockets has broken apart in low-Earth orbit and created a debris cloud consisting of hundreds of pieces, according to multiple space debris-tracking entities.
     
            The rocket launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on Tuesday to deliver 18 G60 satellites into orbit, which marks just the first deployment for the Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology group’s Thousand Sails constellation.
     
            The megaconstellation of satellites will eventually include 1,296 satellites, and there are plans to expand the capacity to around 14,000 to rival SpaceX’s Starlink satellites.
     
            Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. US Space Command, a branch of the US Department of Defense, confirmed the breakup of the rocket on Thursday.
     
            “USSPACECOM has observed no immediate threats and continues to conduct routine conjunction assessments to support the safety and sustainability of the space domain,” according to a US Space Command spokesperson.

            US Space Command is continuing to track the debris and provide information to NASA.
     
            “There has been no immediate threat to the International Space Station observed as a result of this breakup,” said Rob Margetta, public affairs officer at NASA headquarters.
     
            The amount of tracked debris changed by the hour Thursday, beginning with more than 50 tracked by Slingshot Aerospace’s Global Sensor Network. Then, US Space Command said it was tracking more than 300 pieces.
     
            Now, radar data from tracking organization LeoLabs has confirmed that the event resulted in at least 700 debris fragments and potentially more than 900.
 
            It is believed that the rocket broke apart at 503 miles (810 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, and the debris poses “a significant hazard to (low-Earth orbit) constellations” below 497 miles (800 kilometers) altitude, according to Slingshot.
     
            For reference, the International Space Station orbits about 254 miles (408 kilometers) above the Earth.
     
            Slingshot’s Horus sensor systems, which provide satellite tracking in low-Earth orbit, “detected a series of bright, unexpected objects moving along the same orbital path as the rocket body and the G60 satellites it deployed.”
     
            The true risks of the debris cloud won’t be known until experts have a chance to analyze it fully, which could take another day or so. And the reason for the rocket breakup remains unknown.

            Because the Chinese satellites were delivered into orbit around Earth’s poles, rather than an equatorial orbit, they will “pack a real punch with other objects not in polar orbit” like two cars colliding in an intersection, said John L. Crassidis, Moog Professor of Innovation within the University at Buffalo’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
     
            Everything in low-Earth orbit travels at 17,500 miles per hour, Crassidis said.
     
            “The worst-case scenario is when any part of the debris field collides with something that is moving around the equator,” he said. “That’s a T-bone intersection case. Imagine two cars going at 17,000 MPH and crashing at a T-bone intersection. Obviously, that’s bad. Overall any object in its path will still be a bad situation.”
     
            Given the altitude where the breakup occurred, the debris will likely remain in place for several years, and some could remain for decades, but it’s hard to predict how long without knowing the shapes of the debris, Crassidis said.
     
            It’s the second time one of these rocket bodies has experienced a significant breakup event in low-Earth orbit, according to Victoria Heath, associate director of marketing and communications for LeoLabs.
     
            Another Long March 6A rocket body exploded in a region of low-Earth orbit densely populated by satellites on November 12, 2022, and the resulting 500-plus debris fragments were distributed between 198 miles and 932 miles (320 and 1,500 kilometers) and increased the collision risk with satellites, especially at the center of the debris cloud, according to LeoLabs.

            The company conducted an analysis and concluded that the November 2022 event was triggered by an issue related to the spacecraft’s propulsion system, rather than fragmenting due to the rocket colliding with another object.
     
            There are nearly 1,000 abandoned rocket bodies in low-Earth orbit today, according to LeoLabs, and that number only continues to increase due to an uptick in launches as more countries focus on their space ambitions.
     
            “If even a fraction of the launches needed to field this Chinese mega-constellation generate as much debris as this first launch, the result would be a notable addition to the space debris population in (low-Earth orbit),” said Audrey Schaffer, vice president of strategy and policy for Slingshot Aerospace, in a statement.
     
            “Events like this highlight the importance of adherence to existing space debris mitigation guidelines to reduce the creation of new space debris and underscore the need for robust space domain awareness capabilities to rapidly detect, track, and catalog newly-launched space objects so they can be screened for potential conjunctions.”

China has taken a major step forward in its bid to create a rival to SpaceX’s Starlink this week by launching the first of what it hopes will be a constellation of 14,000 satellites beaming broadband internet coverage from space.
     
            Eighteen satellites were blasted into low Earth orbit (LEO) on Tuesday in the inaugural launch for the government-backed Qianfan, or Spacesail, constellation, state media reported.
     
            The constellation – hailed in domestic media as China’s answer to US-based SpaceX’s Starlink – aims to join a handful of planned or operational large-scale space projects from providers in various countries offering broadband satellite internet services.
     
            Leading that pack is Starlink, which has more than 6,000 satellites in orbit and ambitions to expand to as many as 42,000. It is widely expected to remain the dominant player in years to come, given its head start and advanced launch capabilities.
     
            While most people accessing the internet do so through cables and other ground-based infrastructure, satellite internet connection has emerged as an important service for rural, under-resourced and disaster-hit areas. It’s also seen as key for expanding technologies like autonomous cars and other internet-enabled devices – industries that China wants to lead.
     
            Qianfan, also known as G60 Starlink, is among three planned Chinese mega constellations that could see the country’s firms launching nearly 40,000 satellites into low Earth orbit (defined as no more than 1,200 miles above the planet) in the coming years. So-called mega constellations refer to networks of hundreds or thousands of orbiting satellites.
     
            The launch comes as China ramps up its commercial space sector as part of Beijing’s broader bid to cement its place as a dominant power in outer space. The country has already made tremendous strides in its ambitious national space program, which aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, while also launching military-linked satellites for navigation, communication and surveillance.
     
            Controlling LEO broadband satellite constellations could be a boon for China, experts say, enabling its firms to offer services domestically and around the world – while bolstering Beijing’s diplomatic sway, control over data flow and national security.
     
            The rollout of Qianfan, which is run by Shanghai government-backed Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), will also be a test of China’s ability to produce and launch satellites at scale and on a tight timeline.
     
            The constellation is slated to grow to more than 600 satellites by the end of 2025 with plans to reach more than 14,000 satellites providing broadband internet globally by 2030, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            That number would be “sufficient to provide coverage for most human population centers,” Zhu Xiaochen, deputy director of the project, told CCTV.
     
            China’s foray into broadband mega-constellations comes as governments and companies across the world are increasingly eyeing satellites for everything from communications to military operations.
     
            The war in Ukraine, where access to Starlink has been a key asset for the Ukrainian military, has also moved LEO broadband satellites into the spotlight for its security implications.
     
            Chinese researchers have on several occasions raised national security concerns about the SpaceX-run constellation – including one military scholar who said in January that it had the potential to support US “ground forces” and strike capability in “regional conflicts.”

            While the launch of Qianfan is part of Beijing’s broader push to boost space capabilities and commercial applications, its launch also shows China is “recognizing the dual use … potential of these capabilities from the standpoint of informational superiority or data flow control,” said Tomas Hrozensky, a senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank European Space Policy Institute in Vienna.
     
            Constellations like Qianfan, once operational, could also yield diplomatic benefits for Beijing, experts say. For example, China could offer access to its internet and communications services as part of deals with governments within its Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure scheme widely seen as a vehicle for China to build its overseas influence.
     
            Chinese companies’ role in global telecommunications has been a fractious subject in recent years, with the US government raising alarms about alleged security risks for countries using ground-based Chinese infrastructure and equipment.
     
            Some experts warn of related concerns if countries start getting online via Chinese satellites.
     
            “As China begins deploying G60 and other planned LEO broadband constellations, we’ll see them extend their telecommunications model to space – a model based on surveilling and censoring the flow of information,” said Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.
     
            The Qianfan constellation’s launch comes as China’s top leaders have signaled that developing the commercial space sector – including satellites, launch capabilities and tech production – is an economic priority.
     
            The 18 satellites sent into orbit this week appears to put Qianfan ahead of two other planned Chinese communications constellations in LEO. State-owned China Satellite Network Group’s Guowang constellation project aims for nearly 13,000 satellites, and leading private space firm Landspace’s Honghu-3 has plans for 10,000, according to information released in state-linked media.
     
            Plans for the Qianfan project were announced in 2021 as part of a state-backed technology innovation scheme across China’s prosperous Yangtze River delta. Its operating company, the Shanghai-government backed SSST, raised $933 million earlier this year, Reuters reported in February, citing an investor.

            Preparing for the launch has included efforts to streamline satellite production, using what Qianfan’s chief designer Cao Caixia recently described to state broadcaster CCTV as “an intelligent satellite manufacturing platform” to speed up production times.
     
            There are likely to be hurdles as SSST and other Chinese firms seek to rapidly scale-up their constellations. China is opening its first commercial launch pad this year, even as state media says roughly half of the satellites launched last year were commercial ones.
     
            A number of Chinese companies are working to enhance launch capabilities, but those are still significantly behind the kind of technology powering SpaceX’s Starlink, which is expected to further expand its launch capacity once its Starship vehicle comes online.
     
            “Like any spacefaring nation, China will undoubtedly encounter technical and operational challenges,” said CSIS’s Bingen, pointing to the need to establish and scale satellite production lines and launch rockets at a frequent cadence.
     
            “But space is a national priority for Beijing, with these commercial entities receiving top-down support from the (Chinese Communist Party), large tracts of funding, municipal government support, and regulatory leeway, so I would expect China to continue its rapid progress in space.”

            China’s internet exploded with joy and pride Monday after the country’s swimmers ended the United States’ decades-long reign in the men’s 4x100 meters medley at the Olympics, a spectacular win for a Chinese team that has faced intense scrutiny in the wake of a doping controversy.
     
            Pan Zhanle, who set the world record in the 100m freestyle last week, powered China from third position into the lead in the final leg of the relay on Sunday, overtaking his American and French rivals in a stunning reversal.
     
            Pan finished in 45.92 seconds, faster than the 46.40 seconds he swam four days earlier in the 100m final.
     
            Team USA finished 0.55 seconds behind the Chinese team, failing to take gold in the event for the first time since the US boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics and ending its unbeaten streak stretching back to the men’s medley debut at the 1960 Games.
     
            This is China’s second gold in swimming at the Paris Olympics, following Pan’s record-setting win last Wednesday.
     
            But outside China, their success has been met with questions – including from some of their peers in the world of elite swimming – following revelations that nearly half the group Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance.

China doping controversy casts a shadow over Olympic swimming
 
            The swimmers had been cleared by China’s Anti-Doping Agency shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for a banned heart medication were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.
     
            The accusations, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, have sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules.
     
            Concern only deepened last week, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for trace amounts of a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by Chinese officials – again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.
     
            In China, many social media users saw the Chinese swim team’s historic win in the relay as a resounding vindication.
     
            The victory dominated discussions on Chinese social media on Monday, creating several top trending topics on microblogging site Weibo. The hashtag “Pan Zhanle’s stunning reversal” racked up more than 500 million views, as did another hashtag about the relay gold medal.
     
            Pan, who turned 20 on Sunday, called the team gold medal his birthday present.
     
            “I fulfilled the promise I made a year ago by celebrating my 20th birthday with a team gold medal,” he wrote in a viral post on Weibo, where the swimmer became an overnight celebrity with 1.6 million followers.
     
            “A new journey has begun, and the goals have been quietly set. I hope I can make an even greater contribution to the team. The Chinese swim team is always the best!”
     
            Pan also won fans for his confidence and candidness.
     
            In a pool-side interview with state broadcaster CCTV right after the event, some of Pan’s teammates said they were not happy with their own performance in the earlier legs of the relay. Pan cheered and praised his teammates: “The race is over, and the championship is ours. It shouldn’t be us who are dissatisfied; it should be the others.”
     
            In China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the doping allegations have brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment – especially over the scrutiny the team has faced this summer.
     
            Ahead of the relay victory Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Washington called on the US to “stop using the doping issue to smear and suppress China.”
     
            In a statement, the embassy accused the US of “disparaging Chinese athletes and affecting their participation in the Paris Olympics” and “deep-rooted ‘double standards’ mindset.”
     
            Nearly a dozen Chinese swimmers who tested positive three years ago are competing in the Paris Olympics, including two of the quartet that won relay gold on Sunday.
     
            Double gold-medalist Pan did not test positive in 2021, but he has also faced questions over his stellar performance in Paris.
     
            After Pan smashed the world record in the 100m freestyle last week, Brett Hawke, a former Australian Olympic swimmer and coach, posted on Instagram that “it’s not humanly possible to beat that field” and that the swim was “not real life. Not in that pool, against that field.”
     
            Back in China, state media and internet users have rallied to Pan’s defense.
     
            “According to the logic of some in the West, when European and American athletes break records, it is seen as a breakthrough for ‘human potential,’ but when Chinese athletes set records, it is labeled as ‘humanly impossible.’ Isn’t this absurd double standard a blatant form of racism?” the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, said in an English-language editorial Monday.
     
            In another report in Chinese, the outlet accused the US of “exercise ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ over other countries” and “interfering with the Olympics with ‘double standards’ over the anti-doping issue.”
     
            Many Chinese social media users applauded Pan for defying the pressure and proving his accusers wrong.
     
            “If breaking the record the first time didn’t convince the foreigners, this stunning reversal surely did. (Pan’s) so impressive and dominant!” said a comment with 2,300 upvotes.
     
            “Our strength speaks for itself. We won the gold fair and square,” said another.
     
            But overseas, doubts linger.
     
            After Sunday’s relay, British triple Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty called for stricter doping testing after the British team finished fourth in the race.
     
            “I think we’ve got to have faith in the system, but we also don’t,” he said, according to Reuters. “I think it’s just got to be stricter.”
     
            “One of my favorite quotes I’ve seen lately is there’s no point in winning if you don’t win it fair,” Peaty said. “And I think you know that truth in your heart. Even if you touch and you know you’re cheating, you don’t win it, right.
     
            “So, for me, if you’ve been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honorable person, you should be out of the sport.”

            Zheng Qinwen arrived at the Paris Olympics as a top-10 player but an unlikely candidate to win the title. She will leave as China’s first-ever tennis singles champion, the biggest accolade of her young career.
     
            Against Croatia’s Donna Vekić, Zheng produced a stunning display of powerful hitting on the clay of Roland Garros, triumphing 6-2, 6-3 in a hard-fought gold medal match.
     
            Don’t be fooled by the lopsided scoreline – Zheng was made to battle throughout the one-hour, 44-minute contest, saving multiple break points and pouncing on every opportunity she had to get further in front.
     
            Upon winning match point, her delight was laid bare. She dropped to the ground, stretching her arms out wide and caking her back in red clay.
     
            Even Zheng’s idol, two-time grand slam champion Li Na, did not match this feat, never finishing better than fourth at an Olympics.
     
            “That was an unbelievable experience for me. I just made history and I’m so happy for this moment,” Zheng told reporters, adding: “You can see the strength I have in this tournament, the behavior, the eyes, the hunger that I have, it’s different than all the other tournaments I play.”
     
            Perhaps Zheng’s best – and certainly least expected – victory at these Olympics came in the semifinals, ending world No. 1 Iga Świątek’s 25-match winning streak at Roland Garros.
     
            That win would have done wonders for the 21-year-old’s confidence ahead of the final, and she started the match with purpose and aggression by breaking Vekić’s serve for a 2-0 lead.
     
            Vekić, already making history as the first Croatian tennis player to reach an Olympic singles final, took longer to settle. She soon proved equal to Zheng’s big hitting, engineering break points of her own but without capitalizing on them.
     
            You perhaps sensed the 28-year-old’s frustration when Zheng thumped a forehand past her at 4-1 in the first set, and Vekić could only respond by raising her arms in an exasperated fashion.
     
            More break points went begging the next game – Zheng salvaging the game magnificently with a drop volley – and from there it looked hard for Vekić to find a way back into the set.
     
            After 48 minutes, the sixth seed had the early lead sewn up, taking her first set point when Vekić failed to retrieve a forehand.
     
            A brief ray of sunlight swept across the court at the start of the second set but it was still a much cooler Parisian day than previously this week, a welcome relief from the hot and humid playing conditions.
     
            A huge forehand saw Zheng take an early 2-0 lead in the second set before Vekić hit back immediately with her first break of the match.
     
            At 4-3, however, Zheng had another opening. She put away a smash to create two break points – Vekić hurling her racket to the ground in anger – and soon after found herself serving for the title.
     
            The rest was a formality, Zheng breezing through the game and fittingly rounding off the victory with another forehand winner, her 11th of the contest. It marked China’s first medal of any color in the singles and the country’s second in tennis after Li Ting and Sun Tiantian won gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

            “There is a strength holding me from behind that I just feel I never give up during the Games,” said Zheng. “I don’t know why, because in a usual match I just let the match go away. But at this Olympic Games, I just hold and hold, keep fighting and finally I made it.
     
            “I’m really happy to be here, to have won the gold medal, to represent my country,” she added. “I’m supposed to become better, but after this gold medal, I feel I can finally play tennis a bit more relaxed.”
     
            Zheng’s path to the gold medal, not just because of her semifinal victory against bronze medalist Swiatek, has hardly been straightforward. She also came through back-to-back encounters lasting more than three hours against Emma Navarro and Angelique Kerber earlier in the competition.
     
            For Vekić, there are plenty of reasons to be positive. She has produced Croatia’s best-ever result at an Olympic tennis event, backing up her maiden grand slam semifinal appearance at Wimbledon last month.
     
            In the process, the World No. 21 has defeated second seed Coco Gauff and one-time US Open champion Bianca Andreescu in Paris.
     
            “Making the finals on clay, I did not expect that,” Vekić told reporters. “Every time I was winning in the first couple of rounds I was telling my coach I cannot believe the shots that I’m making, how well I’m playing.
     
            “It’s a bit of a surpse but she was better today than me. All credit to her, she was playing really well and she deserved to win.”

            Within 72 hours of the start of the Paris Olympics, star Chinese swimmer Zhang Yufei had already climbed the champions’ podium twice. The former gold medalist won two bronzes as China fights to best rivals like the United States and Australia.
     
            But the wins for Zhang, dubbed China’s “butterfly stroke queen,” have come under scrutiny – both from her legions of fans and the wider sporting world.
     
            The Chinese team is at the center of a controversy that’s roiled international sport following revelations that nearly half the group Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, including Zhang, had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance.
     
            The swimmers had been cleared by China’s Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for banned heart drug trimetazidine - believed to aid endurance and recovery time - were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.
     
            But the situation, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, has sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules. The Times reported that Zhang was one of the swimmers who tested positive at the time.
     
            Concern only deepened Tuesday, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for “trace amounts of a prohibited substance metandienone,” a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by CHINADA – again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.
     
            Since the 2021 case came to light, prominent athletes have voiced concerns about the anti-doping system. US Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart accused WADA of engaging in a cover-up and earlier this week said its failures had “overshadowed” the Olympics. The US government is separately pursuing a criminal investigation.
     
            The furor has continued even after the release earlier this month of interim results from a probe into WADA’s handling of the 2021 case. The report, conducted by an independent investigator, backed the anti-doping body’s decision not to appeal the case. A separate audit by swimming governing body World Aquatics also said it found that body hadn’t mismanaged the case when it too decided not to appeal.
     
            For China’s athletes, however, the pressure is apparent.
     
            As races got underway this weekend, Zhang told reporters she was “deeply worried” that other athletes would view her through a “biased lens” and be reluctant to compete against her.
     
            “I feel so wronged,” said Zhang, denying that Chinese swimmers engaged in doping.
     
            And concerns about transparency within the anti-doping system continue to swirl, especially following the latest revelation.

            The 2022 case, reported by the Times earlier this week, involves a swimmer on the Chinese roster in Paris, according to the paper.
     
            WADA said in its statement that it had thoroughly reviewed that case, which it linked to two other positive tests from Chinese athletes in other sports earlier this year, and “concluded that there was no evidence” to challenge the Chinese finding that contaminated meat was the source of the positive tests. It noted that Chinese authorities had found the steroid in meat samples it tested.
     
            The body also said it had been “unfairly caught in the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers” – in an apparent reference to the pushback it’s received from the US and its anti-doping agency.
     
            In a statement CHINADA said the latest news report “distorted the fact(s) and quoted the relevant case out of context,” noting the “issue of meat contamination of prohibited substances is prevalent worldwide and similar cases have occurred in many countries and regions.”
     
            In a statement sent to CNN earlier this month following the release of the independent probe of WADA’s handling of the 2021 case, CHINADA said the findings proved its “investigation and handling of the facts of the case are reasonable.”
     
            In China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the situation has brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment.
     
            Chinese social media was flooded with an outpouring of support for Zhang over the weekend, as fans called for her not to be upset over a third-place finish Monday in the 100-meter butterfly. Zhang, who won silver in the event in Tokyo, was seen with tears in her eyes at the podium.
     
            “Despite the immense pressure, the fact that you have won a medal is the best outcome,” wrote one social media user on the platform Weibo.
     
            “It mirrors China’s continuous growth and revival, even as it faces encirclement and suppression from the West,” the post added, echoing a point made by many users who portrayed the latest controversy as orchestrated by the US.
     
            “It’s high time to slam our fists on the table over the exclusive global drug system that the US has orchestrated,” said another.
     
            At the heart of the outrage in China is the scrutiny the Chinese swim team has faced in Paris.
     
            Earlier this month, global swimming body World Aquatics acknowledged the 2021 case had “weakened” community trust in its anti-doping system and pledged to test certain athletes “including Chinese athletes taking part in the Paris Olympic Games,” more frequently than others.
     
            Last week, the body said Chinese swimmers have been tested more than those from all other countries, averaging 21 times per swimmer since the start of the year. That compares with an average of four times overs the same period for Australian swimmers and six times for Americans.

            China’s Pan Zhanle, who took gold in the 100-meter men’s freestyle on Wednesday after smashing the world record, said he had been tested more than 20 times in the past few months. He said he didn’t feel “there was any difference or influence (on his performance),” since it was done according to the rules.
     
            But some in China say the testing regime is hurting the team.
     
            On Monday, retired two-time Olympic diving champion Gao Min pointed to Zhang’s bronze win and star swimmer Qin Haiyang’s seventh-place finish in the 100-meter men’s breaststroke.
     
            “Something must have gone awry with the athletes’ pre-competition training. Personally, I believe that seven doping tests in one day might have disrupted our Chinese swimming team,” Gao wrote on Weibo.
     
            That echoed comments earlier this month after Yu Liang, the China national swim team nutritionist, claimed in a Weibo post seen by CNN that the team had undergone nearly 200 tests since arriving in France. The post went viral before being deleted.
     
            A related hashtag received nearly 90 million views, with commentors claiming “unfair” treatment of China’s swimmers and even a conspiracy to disrupt the team’s medal tally by “affecting normal routine and training.”
     
            “Why don’t you complain? Don’t athletes need a break?” said one comment with thousands of likes.
     
            When questioned by a Chinese state media reporter about the testing regime at a briefing in Paris last week, a WADA official said the Chinese swimmers “should be happy that they can show that they’ve been tested so many times, therefore, hopefully the wrong allegations that are put against them can be disproven.”

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern over Beijing’s “destabilizing actions” in the South China Sea in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as the two sought to keep communications open despite a deepening rivalry.
     
            Blinken met with Wang in Laos during a trip to Asia against the backdrop of a fierce US presidential election campaign, which has renewed regional scrutiny over what the world will look like with a new administration in the White House.
     
            The two leaders discussed bilateral, regional, and global issues, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement, adding: “The Secretary made clear that the United States, together with our allies and partners, will advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
     
            In the meeting, Blinken also discussed China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base, warning that the US will take “appropriate measures” if China doesn’t end their support, according to Miller.
     
            A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said that Wang told Blinken the US holds “a wrong perception of China” and urged a return to a “rational and pragmatic China policy.” But the statement added that the two would keep up communication.
     
            The first leg of Blinken’s week-long visit – which includes stops in Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Mongolia – comes amid persistent tensions between the US and China despite efforts by US President Joe Biden’s administration to stabilize rocky relations between the two.
     
            Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as China’s increasingly assertive moves in the South China Sea and threats toward Taiwan, have in recent years soured the Washington-Beijing relationship.
     
            This week the North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers flying near Alaska in what a US defense official said was the first time aircraft from the two countries have been intercepted while operating together.
     
            China’s continued support of Russia more than two years into Moscow’s invasion has been a persistent point of tension for the US, its allies and the Ukrainians.
     
            When NATO leaders met this month, a joint declaration labeled Beijing a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, citing China as giving “large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”

            The US and the European Union in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia’s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods, and sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.
     
            Beijing has sought to position itself as a neutral peace broker in the conflict, despite its deepening political, economic and military ties with Moscow and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s openly close friendship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
     
            Earlier this week, Wang told visiting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
     
            In contrast, both Putin and Russia’s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov have been greeted in Beijing multiple times since the invasion.
     
            Kuleba also visited Hong Kong and urged the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s government to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions.
     
            Among the countries Blinken will visit on his trip are the Philippines and Japan, both of which have a mutual defense treaty with Washington.
     
            The Philippines has tacked closer to the US since the election of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. against a backdrop of increasingly violent clashes between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea.
     
            Before speaking with Wang on Saturday, Blinken urged Southeast Asian countries to work together to address challenges – including Beijing’s “escalating and unlawful actions taken against the Philippines in the South China Sea” – at a meeting with ASEAN foreign ministers.
     
            But he also applauded Manila’s diplomacy with Beijing over the contentious issue, noting that the Philippines on Saturday completed unimpeded a resupply trip to troops stationed on a navy ship grounded at the hotly contested Second Thomas Shoal.

Beijing and Manila made a deal in the South China Sea. But they’re already at odds over what was agreed
 
            Such resupply missions had been the source of months of escalating tensions between the Philippines and China, which reached an interim deal last week to smooth deliveries.
     
            “We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today of the Second Thomas Shoal, which is the product of an agreement reached between the Philippines and China,” Blinken said.
     
            “We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward.”
     
            During his presidency, Biden has pushed to deepen relations with the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, another mutual treaty ally, with Blinken a mainstay on the diplomatic circuit.
     
            Beijing has bristled at such efforts, seeing it as part of Washington’s campaign to encircle China and contain its rise.
     
            Asia is therefore watching closely for what might come next, especially given recent bombshell developments in the US election campaign.
     
            Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump, who recently survived an assassination attempt, has often viewed Washington’s alliances more transactionally than Biden. His running mate JD Vance has advocated halting military aid to Ukraine in favor of focusing on Taiwan’s defense.
     
            Meanwhile the Democratic Party’s campaign was upended by Biden’s decision not to seek re-election, and Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the party’s presumptive nominee.

            Hot Stocks 


 
            The value of some of the world’s best-known luxury companies is plunging as Chinese consumers pull back on spending, with even the most exclusive brands feeling the pain.
     
            First-half sales at Bernard Arnault’s luxury powerhouse LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, dropped 10% year over year in Asia excluding Japan, a region dominated by China. The rout seems to be accelerating, with those sales tumbling 14% in the second quarter, according to results published late Tuesday.
     
            Shares in LVMH, whose offerings also include high-end jewelry and luxury hotel stays, dropped 4.7% Wednesday, their biggest one-day decline since October. The stock had pared some of its losses by Friday early afternoon in Paris, but was still 4﻿.4% lower than before the earnings were released.
     
            The numbers from the bellwether of the luxury industry also had a chilling effect on the stock of Prada, which has fallen 3% from its closing level Tuesday. The Hong Kong-listed company is due to report half-year results next week.
     
            “For now, the (luxury) market remains volatile as investors reassess the once-held belief that luxury brands are a safe-haven investment, shielded from broader economic downturns,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN.
     
            Europe’s top 10 luxury companies have lost $250 billion in market value since March, Reuters reported Thursday.

            The decline in LVMH’s fortunes in China chimes with steep falls in sales in the world’s second-biggest economy reported by Richemont, the owner of jeweler Cartier, and German carmarker Porsche.
     
            Richemont, which saw sales crater 27% in China, Hong Kong and Macao in the three months to the end of June compared with a year prior, said a “low level of consumer confidence” was a key reason for the fall. Similarly, Porsche cited in part “weak demand in the luxury segment” in China.
     
            Mercedes-Benz, another maker of luxury cars, also revealed a drop in sales Friday, albeit a smaller one, with revenue in its cars division dipping 4% in the second quarter. “The Chinese market contracted slightly; the market situation in the premium and luxury segment in China remained weak,” the company said.
     
            Meanwhile, Gucci owner Kering said there was “a marked deceleration” in its revenue in China in the first six months of the year and “trends did not improve greatly in North America and Europe.”
     
            However, Hermes bucked the trend. The company known for Birkin handbags — whose prices range from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars — and silk scarves reported sales growth in all countries in the Asia region, from which Hermes excludes Japan, in the first half of 2024.
     
            The earnings reports reflect a striking turnaround in spending by Chinese shoppers, who splurged on premium goods following the lifting of pandemic restrictions, helping boost growth in the luxury sector.
     
            It appears that China’s faltering economy is finally hurting many brands catering to even the most deep-pocketed consumers. The country is grappling with a number of challenges, from sluggish consumer spending and a persistent property slump to a mounting debt crisis in local governments.
     
            China’s economy grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year, according to official data released last week, missing economists’ expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023.
     
            China’s economic slowdown may not be affecting all shoppers equally but it appears to be curbing ostentatious purchases by the wealthy, in what consultancy Bain & Company has called “luxury shame,” similar to what happened in the United States during the global financial crisis.

But can it play peace broker in global conflicts?,The juxtaposed diplomacy comes as Beijing vies to present itself as a geopolitical heavyweight in a world increasingly divided by the grinding wars in Gaza and Ukraine.,"Jul 25, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            China’s top diplomat Wang Yi has had a busy week in which two devastating conflicts have loomed large.
     
            Wang started by gathering 14 Palestinian factions for reconciliation talks in Beijing, including bitter rivals Hamas and Fatah, before meeting on Wednesday with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Russia’s invasion nearly two and half years ago.
     
            The juxtaposed diplomacy – where talks were closely linked to the grinding wars in Gaza and Ukraine, respectively – came as Beijing vies to present itself as a geopolitical heavyweight in a world increasingly divided by both conflicts.
     
            In a meeting with Kuleba, Wang said Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – marking China’s latest effort to position itself as a “neutral” peace broker in the conflict, even as it has ratcheted up ties with Russia.
     
            And at the conclusion of talks between the Palestinian factions a day earlier, the foreign minister hailed the signing of a declaration on “ending division.” The agreement, viewed with a measure of skepticism in the Middle East where such deals have quickly collapsed before, was a “historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause,” Wang said.
     
            For the Chinese government, experts say, Wang’s week of diplomacy offered a chance to play up desired optics: framing the country as a productive player in intractable conflicts – and an alternative broker to the United States.
     
            China’s ambition is to be “recognized and accepted as a – if not the – global leader, and it seeks to do so by enlisting the support of the Global South, which is more numerous in both population and country terms than the democratic West,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.
     
            But it also signals some of the limits within which Beijing is operating, experts suggest, as it seeks to build a solution in Gaza without having deep influence in the region and calls for peace in Ukraine while keeping tight ties with Russia.
     
            Kuleba’s visit was the first time in the nearly 29 months of Russia’s war on Ukraine that a high-level Ukrainian official has visited China. In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited twice and Kremlin officials have made numerous trips during the same period.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders have previously expressed hope that China could use its close relationship with Russia to push for peace on terms acceptable to Kyiv, which unequivocally calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops and a return to its internationally recognized borders. But Chinese officials have given no public indication of doing so and have instead pushed for any peace efforts to consider “all countries’” security concerns.
     
            Kuleba’s visit comes as Beijing is under increasing pressure from the West over its ties to Russia and allegations it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.
     
            Western rhetoric is also hardening. NATO leaders earlier this month said Beijing was “decisively” enabling Russia’s war by support for its defense industrial base, and Zelensky last month accused China of prolonging – through its “support to Russia” – the war devastating his country.
     
            That may be a topic of conversation later this week when Wang is expected to speak with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in another engagement during a regional meeting in Laos.
     
            Kuleba arrived in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Tuesday saying that there would be “extensive, detailed, substantive” negotiations focused on “one issue - peace in Ukraine.”
     
            “We will talk, we will be looking for common ground. We need to avoid competition between peace plans,” he said in a social media video post, in an apparent reference to the vast distance between Beijing’s proposed “political settlement” for the war and Ukraine’s own peace formula.
     
            Official statements from Beijing and Kyiv after Wednesday’s Wang-Kuleba talks gave no indication that the Ukrainian diplomat had swayed Beijing toward Kyiv’s vision for peace.
     
            Instead, Wang re-emphasized Beijing’s past statements and its call for a “political settlement.” China last year released its view on such a settlement, which backs a ceasefire without stipulating the prior withdrawal of Russian troops, a position criticized as favorable to Moscow’s illegal territorial gains. Neither side mentioned the provision of material or economic support to Russia in official statements.
     
            Wang did appear to leave a door open for Ukraine to rely on China as a broker, saying, according to Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, that “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
     
            Kuleba, for his part, reiterated the country’s position of being ready for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but highlighted that Kyiv sees no such readiness from Moscow.

            Observers say Beijing could, at some point, play a role in any potential future talks, but is unlikely to shift its relationship with Russia.
     
            Xi is widely seen to view China’s northern neighbor as a critical partner in pushing back against a world order he sees as unfairly dominated by the West – and does not want Russia to suffer a damaging defeat.
     
            Chinese leaders may have decided to meet Kuleba now to show they’re trying to “push for peace” amid Western criticism of Beijing’s Russia ties and because of the impending election in the United States, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.
     
            Kyiv is casting a wary eye on those elections that could see a plunge in American support for Ukraine’s defense if Republican candidate Donald Trump wins. Trump’s running mate JD Vance has openly advocated for ending military aid to Ukraine in favor of bolstering Taiwan’s defenses.
     
            “Perhaps Beijing is reading this and feels that they are in a better position to push Kyiv towards a compromise that Moscow might find more amenable,” Chong said.China’s state-linked news outlet Global Times also highlighted expert commentary suggesting Ukraine may realize that “efforts to completely isolate” Russia internationally have failed, as players like India and Brazil – both key Global South nations – have not supported a communique following a Ukraine-backed peace summit in June, which did not include Russia. Beijing has said such conferences should include both Kyiv and Moscow.
     
            Beijing’s efforts to be a platform for Palestinian reconciliation, meanwhile, come as it has presented itself as a leader for voices across the Global South in calling for Palestinian statehood and decrying Israel’s war and its staggering humanitarian cost, while criticizing US backing of Israel.
     
            Wang said that Tuesday’s reconciliation talks between Palestinian factions ended with an agreement “on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.”

Can China play a role in avoiding an all-out war in the Middle East?
 
            The announcement comes as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following Israel’s repeated vow to eradicate Hamas – and a growing push for Palestinian statehood. But it was met with some skepticism from observers in the region given the failure of past attempts at unity.
     
            A US State Department spokesperson questioned whether the deal would “in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire” in the war in Gaza, adding it ran counter to Washington’s position, which is that militant group Hamas should not have a role in the governance of “a unified Gaza and the West Bank” after the war.
     
            Within the region, there is also a sense that some of Beijing’s broader diplomacy around the conflict may be “missing out on the intricacies” of different viewpoints there, while seeking to win backing for its own international agenda, according to Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs.
     
            “Of course there’s frustration with the West and in particular with the US, but at the same time nobody’s looking at China and saying, ‘well, this is the country that’s going to come and solve it,’ because they see it as very self-interested actor with a pretty shallow level of regional knowledge and expertise,” he said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/opinions/china-monster-ship-aggression-problem-timme/index.html,Opinion: China’s ‘monster’ ship is a sign of a much bigger problem,"Instead of guarding, protecting, defending and saving, as a coast guard should do, China is attacking, intimidating, violating and threatening, writes Richard Timme.","Jul 24, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,CNN,China,"
    Editor’s Note: Rear Adm. Richard Timme retired from the US Coast Guard after 32 years of service. As the Coast Guard’s assistant commandant for prevention policy, he led the development and implementation of international and national policy, standards and programs to promote marine safety, security and environmental stewardship. He currently serves as president of VXMarine, a provider of marine assets and services. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
 
            Protect. Defend. Save. Three words that define the US Coast Guard’s missions and are central to its ethos statement. For the antithesis of this ethos, look directly at the China Coast Guard.
     
            For nearly 234 years, the US Coast Guard has been true to that ethos in carrying out its many missions around the country and the globe. Around the world, many countries with a coast guard use a facsimile of the distinguishing US Coast Guard ‘racing stripe’ and white paint scheme, which differentiates these vessels from the Navy, to mark their ships or cutters. It’s an homage, intended or not, to the nobility of purpose embodied in our coast guard.
     
            That is why I find the conduct of the China Coast Guard so jarring and disconcerting — such as attacking and destroying a Philippine resupply mission. It is completely at odds with the ethos of coast guards not just here, but everywhere small naval forces seek to bring governance and stability to the waters for which they are responsible.
     
            China recently continued this aggressive conduct by anchoring one of its behemoth 541-foot coast guard vessels, dubbed by some observers “The Monster,” within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) maritime territory. I’m struck by how closely the ship resembles the 378-foot cutter Mellon that I served aboard as an ensign more than 30 years ago, but the incongruity of the actions of this vessel with my experience is striking.
     
            “Monster” and coast guard don’t belong in the same sentence. However, by the actions of this ship violating the Philippines’ EEZ in an act of intimidation, and the overall conduct of China in the South China Sea and the territorial seas of its many neighbors, it is clear this ship has earned the moniker. And we need to be prepared for additional aggressive actions from China.
     
“Gray zone” warfare is a term that refers to unfriendly actions that fall short of outright armed conflict between nations. It’s somewhat ambiguous and may not be immediately clear to observers what might be involved in the “zone.” US Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo has aptly described these activities as “illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive” — a simple, straightforward characterization of China’s maritime activity in the region.
     
            Instead of guarding, protecting, defending and saving, as a coast guard should do, the China Coast Guard is attacking, intimidating, violating and threatening its neighbors in the region.
     
            China continues to violate international norms, customs of the sea and national boundaries in a vast operating area across the South China Sea. It persists not because no one cares, or due to a lack of protest, but because it is in fact a vast operating area and China brings the most capacity to the region.
     
            According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China now boasts the world’s largest maritime fighting force, with 234 warships in operation. It has 142 coast guard ships complemented by a maritime militia consisting of uniformed crews operating vessels that support China’s efforts to intimidate and harass its neighbors. Additionally, CSIS found in 2021 that some 300 Chinese maritime militia vessels had been operating in disputed South China Sea regions at any given time since 2018.
     
        Instead of guarding, protecting, defending and saving, as a coast guard should do, the China Coast Guard is attacking, intimidating, violating and threatening its neighbors in the region.”
     
        Richard Timme
     
            China has laid claim to contested islands and built artificial ones in disputed waters, while installing military and civilian outposts. It has used these outposts to project persistent presence in disputed areas of the South China Sea. It has attempted to establish sovereignty via its simple presence, seemingly using “possession is nine-tenths of the law” as their guiding principle, and has ignored a 2016 ruling from an international tribunal made under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Despite that ruling, China claims it has “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and has rejected that its vessels, like its coast guard’s “monster,” are operating in the Philippines’ EEZ.
     
            My hat is off to the Philippines and the other nations who have held fast and continue to stand up to these illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities. The US Navy, US Coast Guard and our partners across the US Indo-Pacific Command area of operations will continue to counter these activities and support our allies. We know China is playing the long game with its policies, with a planning horizon extending to 2049, which is the 100-year anniversary of the People’s Republic, and beyond.

            As a matter of policy, and as long as they are successful, China will continue to attempt to exert sovereign control over areas, disputed or not, that serve its interests.

Despite having no land mass in the Arctic, China first styled itself as a “near-Arctic state,” a term that underscores its dominance goals yet has no legal meaning. It continued to press this claim, eventually being granted “permanent observer” status at the Arctic Council. “Observe” is too passive to describe what China is doing there: Through its status, it seeks to influence outcomes in its interest.
     
            On July 5, China commissioned its fourth icebreaker vessel, the Jidi, building on its lead over the United States. In the harsh Arctic and Antarctic operating areas, icebreakers are often the only surface vessels that can safely operate. In addition, they are needed to accompany commercial vessels transiting an ice-affected area and government vessels seeking to carry out military and law enforcement missions by breaking channels through the ice to allow passage.
     
            The US Coast Guard has been pursuing new icebreakers for more than a decade and has begun construction of its long-overdue new Polar Security Cutter. This is the first heavy icebreaker built in the US since 1977, when the US Coast Guard Cutter Polar Sea was commissioned. That vessel is now a spare-parts donor to the only active US heavy icebreaker, the aging Polar Star, which along with the medium icebreaker US Coast Guard Cutter Healy represents the total ability of the United States to bring surface ships to the polar regions — fewer than China’s four icebreakers, and significantly fewer than Russia’s available fleet of 46.

Opinion: As Arctic ice melts, a new Russia-China threat looms
 
            China, like other nations, understands that natural resources above the Arctic Circle are becoming more accessible as the region warms, and that there are increased opportunities for shipping to use new routes as Arctic ice continues to recede. Given that China now puts to sea more commercial ship tonnage than any other nation, it likely sees much to gain.
     
            The United States and other Arctic nations with recognized waters in the Arctic understand that defending sovereign claims to fish stocks, minerals and other resources will require more than lines drawn on a navigation chart. As China has repeatedly shown with its neighbors, ignoring those lines and taking possession of what it wants has led to outcomes in its interest. This tactic has allowed China to build on disputed island chains, fish in others’ EEZs and head off development of oil fields by its neighbors.
     
            I once heard the argument in a budget discussion for new funding that “you can’t just leave a Post-it note on the North Pole.” The point is that with an adversary who’s willing to take possession first — and ask permission never — we must be present to enforce possession of what is legally ours. Without the nine new icebreakers the US Coast Guard is advocating for, though, that is the position the United States will find itself in.
     
            As we invest in icebreakers in the Arctic, we must continue to invest in capacity and capability in the Indo-Pacific — for our Navy, our Coast Guard and our partners such as Japan and the Philippines. Each has a complementary role in providing a counter to the growing Chinese presence across the region.
     
            Our partners must see that we are committed to the rule of law and to them. US presence emboldens our allies as they confront aggression in their waters. Sovereign claims require sovereign presence. Both in the South China Sea and the Arctic.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/asia/south-china-sea-deal-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,Beijing and Manila made a deal in the South China Sea. But they’re already at odds over what was agreed,An interim deal to smooth deliveries to Philippine marines marooned on a ship at a hotly disputed reef in the South China Sea appears to be in doubt after Manila and Beijing gave opposing accounts over what they had agreed to.,"Jul 24, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Kathleen Magramo,China,"
            An interim deal to smooth deliveries to Philippine marines marooned on a ship at a hotly disputed reef in the South China Sea appears to be in doubt after Manila and Beijing gave opposing accounts over what they had agreed to.
     
            Fears of a conflict with global implications have risen in recent months following a series of increasingly violent clashes between Chinese coast guard vessels and Philippine ships at Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands, where Manila grounded a navy ship in 1999 to press its claims.
     
            Following de-escalation talks, Manila and Beijing both said they had reached a “provisional arrangement” on the resupply of necessities to Philippine marines stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre – without either side conceding their maritime claims.
     
            But analysts were skeptical about whether the temporary deal would hold after the two sides provided conflicting details of what their agreement entails.
     
            Here’s what you need to know.
     
            Neither Manila nor Beijing has released the text of the temporary agreement reached on Sunday to cool tensions at the reef, known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren’ai Jiao in China, which is located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan.
     
            A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing had agreed to allow Manila to resupply its personnel on the Sierra Madre with living necessities “in a humanitarian spirit.”
     
            Those resupply missions could only take place “if the Philippines informs China in advance and after on-site verification is conducted,” spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular news briefing.
     
            “China will monitor the entire resupply process,” she added.
     
            Those remarks met pushback in Manila.
     
            The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement on X that the country would continue to assert its rights in the South China Sea, noting the provisional agreement with Beijing had been reached “without compromising national positions.”
     
            Therefore, the Chinese statement “regarding prior notification and on-site confirmation is inaccurate,” the DFA said.
     
            The Philippines made the deal in good faith, was ready to implement it, and urged China to do the same, the statement added.
     
            Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.
     
            In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.
     
            China has ignored the ruling: Manila says Beijing continues to send its maritime militia and coastguard vessels to Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
     
            Under President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the Philippines has taken increasingly assertive steps to protect its claim to shoals in the South China Sea, leading to several confrontations off the Philippine islands.

‘Only pirates do this’: Philippines accuses China of using bladed weapons in major South China Sea escalation
 
            They include standoffs between Chinese boats and tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels; Chinese attempts to block the resupply of the BRP Sierra Madre with water cannons; and a bold move by a lone Filipino diver armed with a knife to sever a massive floating Chinese barrier.
     
            In a major escalation on June 17, the Philippines and China blamed each other for a clash near Second Thomas Shoal in which a Philippine serviceman lost a thumb.
     
            Footage released by the Philippine military showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called “a brazen act of aggression.”
     
            The clash took place just weeks after President Marcos warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be “very close” to an act of war.
     
            The resource-rich South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict, and Western observers say tensions could erupt if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.
     
            Washington and Manila are bound by a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951 that remains in force, stipulating that both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.
     
            The US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, but says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing free passage through seas worldwide.
     
            The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, saying the US is “defending every nation’s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.”
     
            Beijing denounces such operations as illegal.
     
            In remarks at the Aspen Security Forum on July 19, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States would “continue to support the Philippines and stand behind them as they take steps” to resupply the Sierra Madre.
     
            “The most important thing right now is to see de-escalation and to see the ability of the Philippines to do resupplies. We believe that is achievable, and we’re going to drive to make that happen,” Sullivan said.
     
            Analysts have cast doubt on whether the temporary deal between Manila and Beijing will ever be implemented.
     
            Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said both sides may have withheld the written details to allow them to save face – and their differing interpretations could undermine the agreement.
     
            “We’ll only know for sure when we see how China reacts to the next Philippine resupply mission,” he said.
     
            “If the resupply gets through unmolested despite the fact that the Philippines certainly won’t tell China in advance or allow any inspection of the cargo, then that will be a victory for Manila’s strategy over the last two years. And it will certainly be a relief to the United States.”
     
            Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation think tank, said the deal did not address the underlying territorial disputes and appeared to have failed before it had even started.
     
            “The China-Philippines deal is already falling apart, probably because Beijing wishes to keep the appearance of diplomatic engagement while continuing to uphold its bottom line interests – a low-risk and highly effective strategy,” he said.

            Former US President Donald Trump raised eyebrows last week when he accused Taiwan of snatching America’s crown in the $500 billion business of making computer chips.
     
            In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, the Republican presidential nominee repeated his assertion, first made last year, that the island democracy and US ally had taken “almost 100%” of the industry from the United States. “We should have never let that happen,” he added.
     
            Except, it didn’t. Industry experts tell CNN that, far from stealing, Taiwan grew its own semiconductor industry organically through a combination of foresight, hard work and investment.
     
            School children on the island know that the father of its world-beating chips sector is Morris Chang, a 93-year-old Chinese-born American, who started Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 1987 at age 55 after a long career working with semiconductors in the US.
     
            At the time, the industry leaders were Intel (INTC), Motorola (MSI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), where Chang had previously worked. But in starting TSMC (TSM), Chang had an entirely different business model in mind, which was completely revolutionary at the time.
     
            “We had no strength in research and development, or very little anyway. We had no strength in circuit design,” he recalled in a 2007 oral history project recorded for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.
     
            “We had little strength in sales and marketing, and we had almost no strength in intellectual property. The only possible strength that Taiwan had, and even that was a potential one, not an obvious one, was semiconductor manufacturing,” he said.
     
            Thus, the idea of a “pure-play foundry,” or manufacturing semiconductors according to designs provided by clients, was born. That model was dismissed at the time, when having both design and manufacturing capabilities in-house was the norm.
     
            It was this new approach that reshaped the landscape of the global electronics sector and laid the foundation for Taiwan to be the industry leader. It now produces more than 90% of the world’s advanced chips, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
     
            “Because of it, TSMC could focus on manufacturing and be very good at it, and more importantly, it could manufacture for multiple different customers, which would let the company scale up,” said Christopher Miller, author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.”
     
            Scale is critical to TSMC’s success, Miller said, as it tends to generate more revenue — which can be funneled into improving chip production technologies — and drive down manufacturing cost, making the entire operation more efficient.
     
            Today, the tech behemoth possesses the most advanced chip production technologies in the world and plans to keep investing in the area. Last July, TSMC opened its global research and development center in Hsinchu, where it is headquartered.
     
            Experts said the contract manufacturing model, something Taiwan had used in other sectors such as textiles and consumer electronics before chips, worked particularly well.
     
            “The combination of top-tier engineers, relatively lower labor cost and long working hours have led to better productivity,” Konrad Young, a former research and development director at TSMC, told CNN, adding that Taiwan’s comprehensive tech ecosystem is another crucial component of the island’s chip prowess.
     
            “These are factors that are nearly impossible to duplicate,” Young said.
     
            But that doesn’t mean competitors aren’t trying. Intel and Samsung Electronics are both trying to emulate TSMC’s success in making chips for other companies.
     
            When asked by CNN what the Taiwanese government would do if Washington presses Taiwan to move some of its chip-related research and development functions to the US, Premier Cho Jung-tai said the island has no plan to change its playbook.
     
            “Taiwan has very good tech talent and an environment for research, development and investment. We are confident that keeping research and development of cutting-edge technologies in Taiwan is the best choice for these enterprises,” Cho told CNN.
     
            In the Bloomberg Businessweek interview, Trump additionally indicated that Taiwan should pay Washington for its defense.
     
            “Taiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we’re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn’t give us anything,” he said, while suggesting that the US would have difficulty defending the island because of its distance, stating “Taiwan is 9,500 miles away (from the US). It’s 68 miles away from China.”
     
            Within Taiwan, Trump’s remarks are being compared to demands for a “protection fee.” It has caused unease about how the Republican presidential nominee,  if elected president, may affect ties with the US, the island’s most important security guarantor, at a time when the risk of China invading Taiwan looms ever larger.
     
            Persistent tension in the Taiwan Strait has put pressure on TSMC to expand outside of Taiwan to diversify its production base. Within the US, the chip shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the increasingly strategic importance of the industry due to the rivalry between the US and China, have prompted calls to revive chip manufacturing domestically.
     
            In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, aiming to boost domestic production of chips, which stands at about 10% of the global supply, and reduce reliance on Taiwan and South Korea for the most advanced ones.
     
            While it is unclear what a potential Trump presidency could mean for Taiwan, Young says chip firms should strive to find a better way to work together for a mutually beneficial relationship. This is particularly important for TSMC, which is building three factories in Arizona but has faced headwinds in getting its facilities on track because of reasons ranging from different labor laws to work culture.
     
            “TSMC would have to figure out a way to put in place a manufacturing system that fits the culture of wherever it is building its fabs,” Young said, referring to fabrication plants where chips are made. “Only by doing so can TSMC truly become a global company.”

            China’s internet exploded with joy and pride Monday after the country’s swimmers ended the United States’ decades-long reign in the men’s 4x100 meters medley at the Olympics, a spectacular win for a Chinese team that has faced intense scrutiny in the wake of a doping controversy.
     
            Pan Zhanle, who set the world record in the 100m freestyle last week, powered China from third position into the lead in the final leg of the relay on Sunday, overtaking his American and French rivals in a stunning reversal.
     
            Pan finished in 45.92 seconds, faster than the 46.40 seconds he swam four days earlier in the 100m final.
     
            Team USA finished 0.55 seconds behind the Chinese team, failing to take gold in the event for the first time since the US boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics and ending its unbeaten streak stretching back to the men’s medley debut at the 1960 Games.
     
            This is China’s second gold in swimming at the Paris Olympics, following Pan’s record-setting win last Wednesday.
     
            But outside China, their success has been met with questions – including from some of their peers in the world of elite swimming – following revelations that nearly half the group Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance.

China doping controversy casts a shadow over Olympic swimming
 
            The swimmers had been cleared by China’s Anti-Doping Agency shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for a banned heart medication were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.
     
            The accusations, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, have sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules.
     
            Concern only deepened last week, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for trace amounts of a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by Chinese officials – again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.
     
            In China, many social media users saw the Chinese swim team’s historic win in the relay as a resounding vindication.
     
            The victory dominated discussions on Chinese social media on Monday, creating several top trending topics on microblogging site Weibo. The hashtag “Pan Zhanle’s stunning reversal” racked up more than 500 million views, as did another hashtag about the relay gold medal.
     
            Pan, who turned 20 on Sunday, called the team gold medal his birthday present.
     
            “I fulfilled the promise I made a year ago by celebrating my 20th birthday with a team gold medal,” he wrote in a viral post on Weibo, where the swimmer became an overnight celebrity with 1.6 million followers.
     
            “A new journey has begun, and the goals have been quietly set. I hope I can make an even greater contribution to the team. The Chinese swim team is always the best!”
     
            Pan also won fans for his confidence and candidness.
     
            In a pool-side interview with state broadcaster CCTV right after the event, some of Pan’s teammates said they were not happy with their own performance in the earlier legs of the relay. Pan cheered and praised his teammates: “The race is over, and the championship is ours. It shouldn’t be us who are dissatisfied; it should be the others.”
     
            In China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the doping allegations have brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment – especially over the scrutiny the team has faced this summer.
     
            Ahead of the relay victory Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Washington called on the US to “stop using the doping issue to smear and suppress China.”
     
            In a statement, the embassy accused the US of “disparaging Chinese athletes and affecting their participation in the Paris Olympics” and “deep-rooted ‘double standards’ mindset.”
     
            Nearly a dozen Chinese swimmers who tested positive three years ago are competing in the Paris Olympics, including two of the quartet that won relay gold on Sunday.
     
            Double gold-medalist Pan did not test positive in 2021, but he has also faced questions over his stellar performance in Paris.
     
            After Pan smashed the world record in the 100m freestyle last week, Brett Hawke, a former Australian Olympic swimmer and coach, posted on Instagram that “it’s not humanly possible to beat that field” and that the swim was “not real life. Not in that pool, against that field.”
     
            Back in China, state media and internet users have rallied to Pan’s defense.
     
            “According to the logic of some in the West, when European and American athletes break records, it is seen as a breakthrough for ‘human potential,’ but when Chinese athletes set records, it is labeled as ‘humanly impossible.’ Isn’t this absurd double standard a blatant form of racism?” the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, said in an English-language editorial Monday.
     
            In another report in Chinese, the outlet accused the US of “exercise ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ over other countries” and “interfering with the Olympics with ‘double standards’ over the anti-doping issue.”
     
            Many Chinese social media users applauded Pan for defying the pressure and proving his accusers wrong.
     
            “If breaking the record the first time didn’t convince the foreigners, this stunning reversal surely did. (Pan’s) so impressive and dominant!” said a comment with 2,300 upvotes.
     
            “Our strength speaks for itself. We won the gold fair and square,” said another.
     
            But overseas, doubts linger.
     
            After Sunday’s relay, British triple Olympic gold medalist Adam Peaty called for stricter doping testing after the British team finished fourth in the race.
     
            “I think we’ve got to have faith in the system, but we also don’t,” he said, according to Reuters. “I think it’s just got to be stricter.”
     
            “One of my favorite quotes I’ve seen lately is there’s no point in winning if you don’t win it fair,” Peaty said. “And I think you know that truth in your heart. Even if you touch and you know you’re cheating, you don’t win it, right.
     
            “So, for me, if you’ve been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honorable person, you should be out of the sport.”

            Zheng Qinwen arrived at the Paris Olympics as a top-10 player but an unlikely candidate to win the title. She will leave as China’s first-ever tennis singles champion, the biggest accolade of her young career.
     
            Against Croatia’s Donna Vekić, Zheng produced a stunning display of powerful hitting on the clay of Roland Garros, triumphing 6-2, 6-3 in a hard-fought gold medal match.
     
            Don’t be fooled by the lopsided scoreline – Zheng was made to battle throughout the one-hour, 44-minute contest, saving multiple break points and pouncing on every opportunity she had to get further in front.
     
            Upon winning match point, her delight was laid bare. She dropped to the ground, stretching her arms out wide and caking her back in red clay.
     
            Even Zheng’s idol, two-time grand slam champion Li Na, did not match this feat, never finishing better than fourth at an Olympics.
     
            “That was an unbelievable experience for me. I just made history and I’m so happy for this moment,” Zheng told reporters, adding: “You can see the strength I have in this tournament, the behavior, the eyes, the hunger that I have, it’s different than all the other tournaments I play.”
     
            Perhaps Zheng’s best – and certainly least expected – victory at these Olympics came in the semifinals, ending world No. 1 Iga Świątek’s 25-match winning streak at Roland Garros.
     
            That win would have done wonders for the 21-year-old’s confidence ahead of the final, and she started the match with purpose and aggression by breaking Vekić’s serve for a 2-0 lead.
     
            Vekić, already making history as the first Croatian tennis player to reach an Olympic singles final, took longer to settle. She soon proved equal to Zheng’s big hitting, engineering break points of her own but without capitalizing on them.
     
            You perhaps sensed the 28-year-old’s frustration when Zheng thumped a forehand past her at 4-1 in the first set, and Vekić could only respond by raising her arms in an exasperated fashion.
     
            More break points went begging the next game – Zheng salvaging the game magnificently with a drop volley – and from there it looked hard for Vekić to find a way back into the set.
     
            After 48 minutes, the sixth seed had the early lead sewn up, taking her first set point when Vekić failed to retrieve a forehand.
     
            A brief ray of sunlight swept across the court at the start of the second set but it was still a much cooler Parisian day than previously this week, a welcome relief from the hot and humid playing conditions.
     
            A huge forehand saw Zheng take an early 2-0 lead in the second set before Vekić hit back immediately with her first break of the match.
     
            At 4-3, however, Zheng had another opening. She put away a smash to create two break points – Vekić hurling her racket to the ground in anger – and soon after found herself serving for the title.
     
            The rest was a formality, Zheng breezing through the game and fittingly rounding off the victory with another forehand winner, her 11th of the contest. It marked China’s first medal of any color in the singles and the country’s second in tennis after Li Ting and Sun Tiantian won gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

            “There is a strength holding me from behind that I just feel I never give up during the Games,” said Zheng. “I don’t know why, because in a usual match I just let the match go away. But at this Olympic Games, I just hold and hold, keep fighting and finally I made it.
     
            “I’m really happy to be here, to have won the gold medal, to represent my country,” she added. “I’m supposed to become better, but after this gold medal, I feel I can finally play tennis a bit more relaxed.”
     
            Zheng’s path to the gold medal, not just because of her semifinal victory against bronze medalist Swiatek, has hardly been straightforward. She also came through back-to-back encounters lasting more than three hours against Emma Navarro and Angelique Kerber earlier in the competition.
     
            For Vekić, there are plenty of reasons to be positive. She has produced Croatia’s best-ever result at an Olympic tennis event, backing up her maiden grand slam semifinal appearance at Wimbledon last month.
     
            In the process, the World No. 21 has defeated second seed Coco Gauff and one-time US Open champion Bianca Andreescu in Paris.
     
            “Making the finals on clay, I did not expect that,” Vekić told reporters. “Every time I was winning in the first couple of rounds I was telling my coach I cannot believe the shots that I’m making, how well I’m playing.
     
            “It’s a bit of a surpse but she was better today than me. All credit to her, she was playing really well and she deserved to win.”

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/china/china-swimming-controversy-olympics-intl-hnk-spt/index.html,China doping controversy casts a shadow over Olympic swimming,China’s Olympic swim team is at the center of a doping controversy that’s roiled international sport.,"Aug 1, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
            Within 72 hours of the start of the Paris Olympics, star Chinese swimmer Zhang Yufei had already climbed the champions’ podium twice. The former gold medalist won two bronzes as China fights to best rivals like the United States and Australia.
     
            But the wins for Zhang, dubbed China’s “butterfly stroke queen,” have come under scrutiny – both from her legions of fans and the wider sporting world.
     
            The Chinese team is at the center of a controversy that’s roiled international sport following revelations that nearly half the group Beijing sent to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, including Zhang, had months earlier tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance.
     
            The swimmers had been cleared by China’s Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) shortly before the Tokyo Games, after it ruled that the positive tests for banned heart drug trimetazidine - believed to aid endurance and recovery time - were the result of contamination, likely from a hotel restaurant. The global sports doping watchdog World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the assessment without an appeal.
     
            But the situation, first reported by the New York Times and German public broadcaster ARD in April, has sparked backlash in the swimming world, where doping can result in years-long bans for athletes who violate the rules. The Times reported that Zhang was one of the swimmers who tested positive at the time.
     
            Concern only deepened Tuesday, after WADA acknowledged a separate 2022 case in which two Chinese swimmers tested positive for “trace amounts of a prohibited substance metandienone,” a banned anabolic steroid. They were provisionally suspended but later cleared of a violation by CHINADA – again citing contamination linked to food, WADA said.
     
            Since the 2021 case came to light, prominent athletes have voiced concerns about the anti-doping system. US Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart accused WADA of engaging in a cover-up and earlier this week said its failures had “overshadowed” the Olympics. The US government is separately pursuing a criminal investigation.
     
            The furor has continued even after the release earlier this month of interim results from a probe into WADA’s handling of the 2021 case. The report, conducted by an independent investigator, backed the anti-doping body’s decision not to appeal the case. A separate audit by swimming governing body World Aquatics also said it found that body hadn’t mismanaged the case when it too decided not to appeal.
     
            For China’s athletes, however, the pressure is apparent.
     
            As races got underway this weekend, Zhang told reporters she was “deeply worried” that other athletes would view her through a “biased lens” and be reluctant to compete against her.
     
            “I feel so wronged,” said Zhang, denying that Chinese swimmers engaged in doping.
     
            And concerns about transparency within the anti-doping system continue to swirl, especially following the latest revelation.

            The 2022 case, reported by the Times earlier this week, involves a swimmer on the Chinese roster in Paris, according to the paper.
     
            WADA said in its statement that it had thoroughly reviewed that case, which it linked to two other positive tests from Chinese athletes in other sports earlier this year, and “concluded that there was no evidence” to challenge the Chinese finding that contaminated meat was the source of the positive tests. It noted that Chinese authorities had found the steroid in meat samples it tested.
     
            The body also said it had been “unfairly caught in the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers” – in an apparent reference to the pushback it’s received from the US and its anti-doping agency.
     
            In a statement CHINADA said the latest news report “distorted the fact(s) and quoted the relevant case out of context,” noting the “issue of meat contamination of prohibited substances is prevalent worldwide and similar cases have occurred in many countries and regions.”
     
            In a statement sent to CNN earlier this month following the release of the independent probe of WADA’s handling of the 2021 case, CHINADA said the findings proved its “investigation and handling of the facts of the case are reasonable.”
     
            In China, where the swim team has long been a source of Olympic glory, the situation has brought outrage and accusations of unfair treatment.
     
            Chinese social media was flooded with an outpouring of support for Zhang over the weekend, as fans called for her not to be upset over a third-place finish Monday in the 100-meter butterfly. Zhang, who won silver in the event in Tokyo, was seen with tears in her eyes at the podium.
     
            “Despite the immense pressure, the fact that you have won a medal is the best outcome,” wrote one social media user on the platform Weibo.
     
            “It mirrors China’s continuous growth and revival, even as it faces encirclement and suppression from the West,” the post added, echoing a point made by many users who portrayed the latest controversy as orchestrated by the US.
     
            “It’s high time to slam our fists on the table over the exclusive global drug system that the US has orchestrated,” said another.
     
            At the heart of the outrage in China is the scrutiny the Chinese swim team has faced in Paris.
     
            Earlier this month, global swimming body World Aquatics acknowledged the 2021 case had “weakened” community trust in its anti-doping system and pledged to test certain athletes “including Chinese athletes taking part in the Paris Olympic Games,” more frequently than others.
     
            Last week, the body said Chinese swimmers have been tested more than those from all other countries, averaging 21 times per swimmer since the start of the year. That compares with an average of four times overs the same period for Australian swimmers and six times for Americans.

            China’s Pan Zhanle, who took gold in the 100-meter men’s freestyle on Wednesday after smashing the world record, said he had been tested more than 20 times in the past few months. He said he didn’t feel “there was any difference or influence (on his performance),” since it was done according to the rules.
     
            But some in China say the testing regime is hurting the team.
     
            On Monday, retired two-time Olympic diving champion Gao Min pointed to Zhang’s bronze win and star swimmer Qin Haiyang’s seventh-place finish in the 100-meter men’s breaststroke.
     
            “Something must have gone awry with the athletes’ pre-competition training. Personally, I believe that seven doping tests in one day might have disrupted our Chinese swimming team,” Gao wrote on Weibo.
     
            That echoed comments earlier this month after Yu Liang, the China national swim team nutritionist, claimed in a Weibo post seen by CNN that the team had undergone nearly 200 tests since arriving in France. The post went viral before being deleted.
     
            A related hashtag received nearly 90 million views, with commentors claiming “unfair” treatment of China’s swimmers and even a conspiracy to disrupt the team’s medal tally by “affecting normal routine and training.”
     
            “Why don’t you complain? Don’t athletes need a break?” said one comment with thousands of likes.
     
            When questioned by a Chinese state media reporter about the testing regime at a briefing in Paris last week, a WADA official said the Chinese swimmers “should be happy that they can show that they’ve been tested so many times, therefore, hopefully the wrong allegations that are put against them can be disproven.”

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern over Beijing’s “destabilizing actions” in the South China Sea in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as the two sought to keep communications open despite a deepening rivalry.
     
            Blinken met with Wang in Laos during a trip to Asia against the backdrop of a fierce US presidential election campaign, which has renewed regional scrutiny over what the world will look like with a new administration in the White House.
     
            The two leaders discussed bilateral, regional, and global issues, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement, adding: “The Secretary made clear that the United States, together with our allies and partners, will advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
     
            In the meeting, Blinken also discussed China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base, warning that the US will take “appropriate measures” if China doesn’t end their support, according to Miller.
     
            A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said that Wang told Blinken the US holds “a wrong perception of China” and urged a return to a “rational and pragmatic China policy.” But the statement added that the two would keep up communication.
     
            The first leg of Blinken’s week-long visit – which includes stops in Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Mongolia – comes amid persistent tensions between the US and China despite efforts by US President Joe Biden’s administration to stabilize rocky relations between the two.
     
            Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as China’s increasingly assertive moves in the South China Sea and threats toward Taiwan, have in recent years soured the Washington-Beijing relationship.
     
            This week the North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers flying near Alaska in what a US defense official said was the first time aircraft from the two countries have been intercepted while operating together.
     
            China’s continued support of Russia more than two years into Moscow’s invasion has been a persistent point of tension for the US, its allies and the Ukrainians.
     
            When NATO leaders met this month, a joint declaration labeled Beijing a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, citing China as giving “large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”

            The US and the European Union in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia’s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods, and sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.
     
            Beijing has sought to position itself as a neutral peace broker in the conflict, despite its deepening political, economic and military ties with Moscow and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s openly close friendship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
     
            Earlier this week, Wang told visiting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
     
            In contrast, both Putin and Russia’s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov have been greeted in Beijing multiple times since the invasion.
     
            Kuleba also visited Hong Kong and urged the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s government to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions.
     
            Among the countries Blinken will visit on his trip are the Philippines and Japan, both of which have a mutual defense treaty with Washington.
     
            The Philippines has tacked closer to the US since the election of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. against a backdrop of increasingly violent clashes between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea.
     
            Before speaking with Wang on Saturday, Blinken urged Southeast Asian countries to work together to address challenges – including Beijing’s “escalating and unlawful actions taken against the Philippines in the South China Sea” – at a meeting with ASEAN foreign ministers.
     
            But he also applauded Manila’s diplomacy with Beijing over the contentious issue, noting that the Philippines on Saturday completed unimpeded a resupply trip to troops stationed on a navy ship grounded at the hotly contested Second Thomas Shoal.

            Such resupply missions had been the source of months of escalating tensions between the Philippines and China, which reached an interim deal last week to smooth deliveries.
     
            “We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today of the Second Thomas Shoal, which is the product of an agreement reached between the Philippines and China,” Blinken said.
     
            “We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward.”
     
            During his presidency, Biden has pushed to deepen relations with the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, another mutual treaty ally, with Blinken a mainstay on the diplomatic circuit.
     
            Beijing has bristled at such efforts, seeing it as part of Washington’s campaign to encircle China and contain its rise.
     
            Asia is therefore watching closely for what might come next, especially given recent bombshell developments in the US election campaign.
     
            Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump, who recently survived an assassination attempt, has often viewed Washington’s alliances more transactionally than Biden. His running mate JD Vance has advocated halting military aid to Ukraine in favor of focusing on Taiwan’s defense.
     
            Meanwhile the Democratic Party’s campaign was upended by Biden’s decision not to seek re-election, and Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the party’s presumptive nominee.

            Hot Stocks 


 
            The value of some of the world’s best-known luxury companies is plunging as Chinese consumers pull back on spending, with even the most exclusive brands feeling the pain.
     
            First-half sales at Bernard Arnault’s luxury powerhouse LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, dropped 10% year over year in Asia excluding Japan, a region dominated by China. The rout seems to be accelerating, with those sales tumbling 14% in the second quarter, according to results published late Tuesday.
     
            Shares in LVMH, whose offerings also include high-end jewelry and luxury hotel stays, dropped 4.7% Wednesday, their biggest one-day decline since October. The stock had pared some of its losses by Friday early afternoon in Paris, but was still 4﻿.4% lower than before the earnings were released.
     
            The numbers from the bellwether of the luxury industry also had a chilling effect on the stock of Prada, which has fallen 3% from its closing level Tuesday. The Hong Kong-listed company is due to report half-year results next week.
     
            “For now, the (luxury) market remains volatile as investors reassess the once-held belief that luxury brands are a safe-haven investment, shielded from broader economic downturns,” Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN.
     
            Europe’s top 10 luxury companies have lost $250 billion in market value since March, Reuters reported Thursday.

            The decline in LVMH’s fortunes in China chimes with steep falls in sales in the world’s second-biggest economy reported by Richemont, the owner of jeweler Cartier, and German carmarker Porsche.
     
            Richemont, which saw sales crater 27% in China, Hong Kong and Macao in the three months to the end of June compared with a year prior, said a “low level of consumer confidence” was a key reason for the fall. Similarly, Porsche cited in part “weak demand in the luxury segment” in China.
     
            Mercedes-Benz, another maker of luxury cars, also revealed a drop in sales Friday, albeit a smaller one, with revenue in its cars division dipping 4% in the second quarter. “The Chinese market contracted slightly; the market situation in the premium and luxury segment in China remained weak,” the company said.
     
            Meanwhile, Gucci owner Kering said there was “a marked deceleration” in its revenue in China in the first six months of the year and “trends did not improve greatly in North America and Europe.”
     
            However, Hermes bucked the trend. The company known for Birkin handbags — whose prices range from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars — and silk scarves reported sales growth in all countries in the Asia region, from which Hermes excludes Japan, in the first half of 2024.
     
            The earnings reports reflect a striking turnaround in spending by Chinese shoppers, who splurged on premium goods following the lifting of pandemic restrictions, helping boost growth in the luxury sector.
     
            It appears that China’s faltering economy is finally hurting many brands catering to even the most deep-pocketed consumers. The country is grappling with a number of challenges, from sluggish consumer spending and a persistent property slump to a mounting debt crisis in local governments.
     
            China’s economy grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year, according to official data released last week, missing economists’ expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023.
     
            China’s economic slowdown may not be affecting all shoppers equally but it appears to be curbing ostentatious purchases by the wealthy, in what consultancy Bain & Company has called “luxury shame,” similar to what happened in the United States during the global financial crisis.

But can it play peace broker in global conflicts?,The juxtaposed diplomacy comes as Beijing vies to present itself as a geopolitical heavyweight in a world increasingly divided by the grinding wars in Gaza and Ukraine.,"Jul 25, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            China’s top diplomat Wang Yi has had a busy week in which two devastating conflicts have loomed large.
     
            Wang started by gathering 14 Palestinian factions for reconciliation talks in Beijing, including bitter rivals Hamas and Fatah, before meeting on Wednesday with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba – the first time China has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Russia’s invasion nearly two and half years ago.
     
            The juxtaposed diplomacy – where talks were closely linked to the grinding wars in Gaza and Ukraine, respectively – came as Beijing vies to present itself as a geopolitical heavyweight in a world increasingly divided by both conflicts.
     
            In a meeting with Kuleba, Wang said Beijing “supported all efforts that contribute to peace” – marking China’s latest effort to position itself as a “neutral” peace broker in the conflict, even as it has ratcheted up ties with Russia.
     
            And at the conclusion of talks between the Palestinian factions a day earlier, the foreign minister hailed the signing of a declaration on “ending division.” The agreement, viewed with a measure of skepticism in the Middle East where such deals have quickly collapsed before, was a “historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause,” Wang said.
     
            For the Chinese government, experts say, Wang’s week of diplomacy offered a chance to play up desired optics: framing the country as a productive player in intractable conflicts – and an alternative broker to the United States.
     
            China’s ambition is to be “recognized and accepted as a – if not the – global leader, and it seeks to do so by enlisting the support of the Global South, which is more numerous in both population and country terms than the democratic West,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.
     
            But it also signals some of the limits within which Beijing is operating, experts suggest, as it seeks to build a solution in Gaza without having deep influence in the region and calls for peace in Ukraine while keeping tight ties with Russia.
     
            Kuleba’s visit was the first time in the nearly 29 months of Russia’s war on Ukraine that a high-level Ukrainian official has visited China. In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited twice and Kremlin officials have made numerous trips during the same period.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders have previously expressed hope that China could use its close relationship with Russia to push for peace on terms acceptable to Kyiv, which unequivocally calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops and a return to its internationally recognized borders. But Chinese officials have given no public indication of doing so and have instead pushed for any peace efforts to consider “all countries’” security concerns.
     
            Kuleba’s visit comes as Beijing is under increasing pressure from the West over its ties to Russia and allegations it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.
     
            Western rhetoric is also hardening. NATO leaders earlier this month said Beijing was “decisively” enabling Russia’s war by support for its defense industrial base, and Zelensky last month accused China of prolonging – through its “support to Russia” – the war devastating his country.
     
            That may be a topic of conversation later this week when Wang is expected to speak with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in another engagement during a regional meeting in Laos.
     
            Kuleba arrived in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Tuesday saying that there would be “extensive, detailed, substantive” negotiations focused on “one issue - peace in Ukraine.”
     
            “We will talk, we will be looking for common ground. We need to avoid competition between peace plans,” he said in a social media video post, in an apparent reference to the vast distance between Beijing’s proposed “political settlement” for the war and Ukraine’s own peace formula.
     
            Official statements from Beijing and Kyiv after Wednesday’s Wang-Kuleba talks gave no indication that the Ukrainian diplomat had swayed Beijing toward Kyiv’s vision for peace.
     
            Instead, Wang re-emphasized Beijing’s past statements and its call for a “political settlement.” China last year released its view on such a settlement, which backs a ceasefire without stipulating the prior withdrawal of Russian troops, a position criticized as favorable to Moscow’s illegal territorial gains. Neither side mentioned the provision of material or economic support to Russia in official statements.
     
            Wang did appear to leave a door open for Ukraine to rely on China as a broker, saying, according to Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, that “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
     
            Kuleba, for his part, reiterated the country’s position of being ready for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but highlighted that Kyiv sees no such readiness from Moscow.

            Observers say Beijing could, at some point, play a role in any potential future talks, but is unlikely to shift its relationship with Russia.
     
            Xi is widely seen to view China’s northern neighbor as a critical partner in pushing back against a world order he sees as unfairly dominated by the West – and does not want Russia to suffer a damaging defeat.
     
            Chinese leaders may have decided to meet Kuleba now to show they’re trying to “push for peace” amid Western criticism of Beijing’s Russia ties and because of the impending election in the United States, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.
     
            Kyiv is casting a wary eye on those elections that could see a plunge in American support for Ukraine’s defense if Republican candidate Donald Trump wins. Trump’s running mate JD Vance has openly advocated for ending military aid to Ukraine in favor of bolstering Taiwan’s defenses.
     
            “Perhaps Beijing is reading this and feels that they are in a better position to push Kyiv towards a compromise that Moscow might find more amenable,” Chong said.China’s state-linked news outlet Global Times also highlighted expert commentary suggesting Ukraine may realize that “efforts to completely isolate” Russia internationally have failed, as players like India and Brazil – both key Global South nations – have not supported a communique following a Ukraine-backed peace summit in June, which did not include Russia. Beijing has said such conferences should include both Kyiv and Moscow.
     
            Beijing’s efforts to be a platform for Palestinian reconciliation, meanwhile, come as it has presented itself as a leader for voices across the Global South in calling for Palestinian statehood and decrying Israel’s war and its staggering humanitarian cost, while criticizing US backing of Israel.
     
            Wang said that Tuesday’s reconciliation talks between Palestinian factions ended with an agreement “on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.”

Can China play a role in avoiding an all-out war in the Middle East?
 
            The announcement comes as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following Israel’s repeated vow to eradicate Hamas – and a growing push for Palestinian statehood. But it was met with some skepticism from observers in the region given the failure of past attempts at unity.
     
            A US State Department spokesperson questioned whether the deal would “in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire” in the war in Gaza, adding it ran counter to Washington’s position, which is that militant group Hamas should not have a role in the governance of “a unified Gaza and the West Bank” after the war.
     
            Within the region, there is also a sense that some of Beijing’s broader diplomacy around the conflict may be “missing out on the intricacies” of different viewpoints there, while seeking to win backing for its own international agenda, according to Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council’s Middle East programs.
     
            “Of course there’s frustration with the West and in particular with the US, but at the same time nobody’s looking at China and saying, ‘well, this is the country that’s going to come and solve it,’ because they see it as very self-interested actor with a pretty shallow level of regional knowledge and expertise,” he said.

    Editor’s Note: Rear Adm. Richard Timme retired from the US Coast Guard after 32 years of service. As the Coast Guard’s assistant commandant for prevention policy, he led the development and implementation of international and national policy, standards and programs to promote marine safety, security and environmental stewardship. He currently serves as president of VXMarine, a provider of marine assets and services. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
 
            Protect. Defend. Save. Three words that define the US Coast Guard’s missions and are central to its ethos statement. For the antithesis of this ethos, look directly at the China Coast Guard.
     
            For nearly 234 years, the US Coast Guard has been true to that ethos in carrying out its many missions around the country and the globe. Around the world, many countries with a coast guard use a facsimile of the distinguishing US Coast Guard ‘racing stripe’ and white paint scheme, which differentiates these vessels from the Navy, to mark their ships or cutters. It’s an homage, intended or not, to the nobility of purpose embodied in our coast guard.
     
            That is why I find the conduct of the China Coast Guard so jarring and disconcerting — such as attacking and destroying a Philippine resupply mission. It is completely at odds with the ethos of coast guards not just here, but everywhere small naval forces seek to bring governance and stability to the waters for which they are responsible.
     
            China recently continued this aggressive conduct by anchoring one of its behemoth 541-foot coast guard vessels, dubbed by some observers “The Monster,” within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) maritime territory. I’m struck by how closely the ship resembles the 378-foot cutter Mellon that I served aboard as an ensign more than 30 years ago, but the incongruity of the actions of this vessel with my experience is striking.
     
            “Monster” and coast guard don’t belong in the same sentence. However, by the actions of this ship violating the Philippines’ EEZ in an act of intimidation, and the overall conduct of China in the South China Sea and the territorial seas of its many neighbors, it is clear this ship has earned the moniker. And we need to be prepared for additional aggressive actions from China.
     
“Gray zone” warfare is a term that refers to unfriendly actions that fall short of outright armed conflict between nations. It’s somewhat ambiguous and may not be immediately clear to observers what might be involved in the “zone.” US Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo has aptly described these activities as “illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive” — a simple, straightforward characterization of China’s maritime activity in the region.
     
            Instead of guarding, protecting, defending and saving, as a coast guard should do, the China Coast Guard is attacking, intimidating, violating and threatening its neighbors in the region.
     
            China continues to violate international norms, customs of the sea and national boundaries in a vast operating area across the South China Sea. It persists not because no one cares, or due to a lack of protest, but because it is in fact a vast operating area and China brings the most capacity to the region.
     
            According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China now boasts the world’s largest maritime fighting force, with 234 warships in operation. It has 142 coast guard ships complemented by a maritime militia consisting of uniformed crews operating vessels that support China’s efforts to intimidate and harass its neighbors. Additionally, CSIS found in 2021 that some 300 Chinese maritime militia vessels had been operating in disputed South China Sea regions at any given time since 2018.
     
        Instead of guarding, protecting, defending and saving, as a coast guard should do, the China Coast Guard is attacking, intimidating, violating and threatening its neighbors in the region.”
     
        Richard Timme
     
            China has laid claim to contested islands and built artificial ones in disputed waters, while installing military and civilian outposts. It has used these outposts to project persistent presence in disputed areas of the South China Sea. It has attempted to establish sovereignty via its simple presence, seemingly using “possession is nine-tenths of the law” as their guiding principle, and has ignored a 2016 ruling from an international tribunal made under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Despite that ruling, China claims it has “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and has rejected that its vessels, like its coast guard’s “monster,” are operating in the Philippines’ EEZ.
     
            My hat is off to the Philippines and the other nations who have held fast and continue to stand up to these illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities. The US Navy, US Coast Guard and our partners across the US Indo-Pacific Command area of operations will continue to counter these activities and support our allies. We know China is playing the long game with its policies, with a planning horizon extending to 2049, which is the 100-year anniversary of the People’s Republic, and beyond.

Chinese ships spend record amount of time near Japan-controlled islands, Tokyo says
 
            As a matter of policy, and as long as they are successful, China will continue to attempt to exert sovereign control over areas, disputed or not, that serve its interests.
     
            Look next to the Arctic. Despite having no land mass in the Arctic, China first styled itself as a “near-Arctic state,” a term that underscores its dominance goals yet has no legal meaning. It continued to press this claim, eventually being granted “permanent observer” status at the Arctic Council. “Observe” is too passive to describe what China is doing there: Through its status, it seeks to influence outcomes in its interest.
     
            On July 5, China commissioned its fourth icebreaker vessel, the Jidi, building on its lead over the United States. In the harsh Arctic and Antarctic operating areas, icebreakers are often the only surface vessels that can safely operate. In addition, they are needed to accompany commercial vessels transiting an ice-affected area and government vessels seeking to carry out military and law enforcement missions by breaking channels through the ice to allow passage.
     
            The US Coast Guard has been pursuing new icebreakers for more than a decade and has begun construction of its long-overdue new Polar Security Cutter. This is the first heavy icebreaker built in the US since 1977, when the US Coast Guard Cutter Polar Sea was commissioned. That vessel is now a spare-parts donor to the only active US heavy icebreaker, the aging Polar Star, which along with the medium icebreaker US Coast Guard Cutter Healy represents the total ability of the United States to bring surface ships to the polar regions — fewer than China’s four icebreakers, and significantly fewer than Russia’s available fleet of 46.

Opinion: As Arctic ice melts, a new Russia-China threat looms
 
            China, like other nations, understands that natural resources above the Arctic Circle are becoming more accessible as the region warms, and that there are increased opportunities for shipping to use new routes as Arctic ice continues to recede. Given that China now puts to sea more commercial ship tonnage than any other nation, it likely sees much to gain.
     
            The United States and other Arctic nations with recognized waters in the Arctic understand that defending sovereign claims to fish stocks, minerals and other resources will require more than lines drawn on a navigation chart. As China has repeatedly shown with its neighbors, ignoring those lines and taking possession of what it wants has led to outcomes in its interest. This tactic has allowed China to build on disputed island chains, fish in others’ EEZs and head off development of oil fields by its neighbors.
     
            I once heard the argument in a budget discussion for new funding that “you can’t just leave a Post-it note on the North Pole.” The point is that with an adversary who’s willing to take possession first — and ask permission never — we must be present to enforce possession of what is legally ours. Without the nine new icebreakers the US Coast Guard is advocating for, though, that is the position the United States will find itself in.
     
            As we invest in icebreakers in the Arctic, we must continue to invest in capacity and capability in the Indo-Pacific — for our Navy, our Coast Guard and our partners such as Japan and the Philippines. Each has a complementary role in providing a counter to the growing Chinese presence across the region.
     
            Our partners must see that we are committed to the rule of law and to them. US presence emboldens our allies as they confront aggression in their waters. Sovereign claims require sovereign presence. Both in the South China Sea and the Arctic.

But they’re already at odds over what was agreed,An interim deal to smooth deliveries to Philippine marines marooned on a ship at a hotly disputed reef in the South China Sea appears to be in doubt after Manila and Beijing gave opposing accounts over what they had agreed to.,"Jul 24, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Kathleen Magramo,China,"
            An interim deal to smooth deliveries to Philippine marines marooned on a ship at a hotly disputed reef in the South China Sea appears to be in doubt after Manila and Beijing gave opposing accounts over what they had agreed to.
     
            Fears of a conflict with global implications have risen in recent months following a series of increasingly violent clashes between Chinese coast guard vessels and Philippine ships at Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands, where Manila grounded a navy ship in 1999 to press its claims.
     
            Following de-escalation talks, Manila and Beijing both said they had reached a “provisional arrangement” on the resupply of necessities to Philippine marines stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre – without either side conceding their maritime claims.
     
            But analysts were skeptical about whether the temporary deal would hold after the two sides provided conflicting details of what their agreement entails.
     
            Here’s what you need to know.
     
            Neither Manila nor Beijing has released the text of the temporary agreement reached on Sunday to cool tensions at the reef, known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren’ai Jiao in China, which is located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan.
     
            A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing had agreed to allow Manila to resupply its personnel on the Sierra Madre with living necessities “in a humanitarian spirit.”
     
            Those resupply missions could only take place “if the Philippines informs China in advance and after on-site verification is conducted,” spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular news briefing.
     
            “China will monitor the entire resupply process,” she added.
     
            Those remarks met pushback in Manila.
     
            The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement on X that the country would continue to assert its rights in the South China Sea, noting the provisional agreement with Beijing had been reached “without compromising national positions.”
     
            Therefore, the Chinese statement “regarding prior notification and on-site confirmation is inaccurate,” the DFA said.
     
            The Philippines made the deal in good faith, was ready to implement it, and urged China to do the same, the statement added.
     
            Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.
     
            In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.
     
            China has ignored the ruling: Manila says Beijing continues to send its maritime militia and coastguard vessels to Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
     
            Under President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the Philippines has taken increasingly assertive steps to protect its claim to shoals in the South China Sea, leading to several confrontations off the Philippine islands.

‘Only pirates do this’: Philippines accuses China of using bladed weapons in major South China Sea escalation
 
            They include standoffs between Chinese boats and tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels; Chinese attempts to block the resupply of the BRP Sierra Madre with water cannons; and a bold move by a lone Filipino diver armed with a knife to sever a massive floating Chinese barrier.
     
            In a major escalation on June 17, the Philippines and China blamed each other for a clash near Second Thomas Shoal in which a Philippine serviceman lost a thumb.
     
            Footage released by the Philippine military showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called “a brazen act of aggression.”
     
            The clash took place just weeks after President Marcos warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be “very close” to an act of war.
     
            The resource-rich South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict, and Western observers say tensions could erupt if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.
     
            Washington and Manila are bound by a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951 that remains in force, stipulating that both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.
     
            The US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, but says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing free passage through seas worldwide.
     
            The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, saying the US is “defending every nation’s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.”
     
            Beijing denounces such operations as illegal.
     
            In remarks at the Aspen Security Forum on July 19, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States would “continue to support the Philippines and stand behind them as they take steps” to resupply the Sierra Madre.
     
            “The most important thing right now is to see de-escalation and to see the ability of the Philippines to do resupplies. We believe that is achievable, and we’re going to drive to make that happen,” Sullivan said.
     
            Analysts have cast doubt on whether the temporary deal between Manila and Beijing will ever be implemented.
     
            Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said both sides may have withheld the written details to allow them to save face – and their differing interpretations could undermine the agreement.
     
            “We’ll only know for sure when we see how China reacts to the next Philippine resupply mission,” he said.
     
            “If the resupply gets through unmolested despite the fact that the Philippines certainly won’t tell China in advance or allow any inspection of the cargo, then that will be a victory for Manila’s strategy over the last two years. And it will certainly be a relief to the United States.”
     
            Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation think tank, said the deal did not address the underlying territorial disputes and appeared to have failed before it had even started.
     
            “The China-Philippines deal is already falling apart, probably because Beijing wishes to keep the appearance of diplomatic engagement while continuing to uphold its bottom line interests – a low-risk and highly effective strategy,” he said.

            Former US President Donald Trump raised eyebrows last week when he accused Taiwan of snatching America’s crown in the $500 billion business of making computer chips.
     
            In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, the Republican presidential nominee repeated his assertion, first made last year, that the island democracy and US ally had taken “almost 100%” of the industry from the United States. “We should have never let that happen,” he added.
     
            Except, it didn’t. Industry experts tell CNN that, far from stealing, Taiwan grew its own semiconductor industry organically through a combination of foresight, hard work and investment.
     
            School children on the island know that the father of its world-beating chips sector is Morris Chang, a 93-year-old Chinese-born American, who started Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 1987 at age 55 after a long career working with semiconductors in the US.
     
            At the time, the industry leaders were Intel (INTC), Motorola (MSI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), where Chang had previously worked. But in starting TSMC (TSM), Chang had an entirely different business model in mind, which was completely revolutionary at the time.
     
            “We had no strength in research and development, or very little anyway. We had no strength in circuit design,” he recalled in a 2007 oral history project recorded for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.
     
            “We had little strength in sales and marketing, and we had almost no strength in intellectual property. The only possible strength that Taiwan had, and even that was a potential one, not an obvious one, was semiconductor manufacturing,” he said.
     
            Thus, the idea of a “pure-play foundry,” or manufacturing semiconductors according to designs provided by clients, was born. That model was dismissed at the time, when having both design and manufacturing capabilities in-house was the norm.
     
            It was this new approach that reshaped the landscape of the global electronics sector and laid the foundation for Taiwan to be the industry leader. It now produces more than 90% of the world’s advanced chips, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
     
            “Because of it, TSMC could focus on manufacturing and be very good at it, and more importantly, it could manufacture for multiple different customers, which would let the company scale up,” said Christopher Miller, author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.”
     
            Scale is critical to TSMC’s success, Miller said, as it tends to generate more revenue — which can be funneled into improving chip production technologies — and drive down manufacturing cost, making the entire operation more efficient.
     
            Today, the tech behemoth possesses the most advanced chip production technologies in the world and plans to keep investing in the area. Last July, TSMC opened its global research and development center in Hsinchu, where it is headquartered.
     
            Experts said the contract manufacturing model, something Taiwan had used in other sectors such as textiles and consumer electronics before chips, worked particularly well.
     
            “The combination of top-tier engineers, relatively lower labor cost and long working hours have led to better productivity,” Konrad Young, a former research and development director at TSMC, told CNN, adding that Taiwan’s comprehensive tech ecosystem is another crucial component of the island’s chip prowess.
     
            “These are factors that are nearly impossible to duplicate,” Young said.
     
            But that doesn’t mean competitors aren’t trying. Intel and Samsung Electronics are both trying to emulate TSMC’s success in making chips for other companies.
     
            When asked by CNN what the Taiwanese government would do if Washington presses Taiwan to move some of its chip-related research and development functions to the US, Premier Cho Jung-tai said the island has no plan to change its playbook.
     
            “Taiwan has very good tech talent and an environment for research, development and investment. We are confident that keeping research and development of cutting-edge technologies in Taiwan is the best choice for these enterprises,” Cho told CNN.
     
            In the Bloomberg Businessweek interview, Trump additionally indicated that Taiwan should pay Washington for its defense.
     
            “Taiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we’re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn’t give us anything,” he said, while suggesting that the US would have difficulty defending the island because of its distance, stating “Taiwan is 9,500 miles away (from the US). It’s 68 miles away from China.”
     
            Within Taiwan, Trump’s remarks are being compared to demands for a “protection fee.” It has caused unease about how the Republican presidential nominee,  if elected president, may affect ties with the US, the island’s most important security guarantor, at a time when the risk of China invading Taiwan looms ever larger.
     
            Persistent tension in the Taiwan Strait has put pressure on TSMC to expand outside of Taiwan to diversify its production base. Within the US, the chip shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the increasingly strategic importance of the industry due to the rivalry between the US and China, have prompted calls to revive chip manufacturing domestically.
     
            In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, aiming to boost domestic production of chips, which stands at about 10% of the global supply, and reduce reliance on Taiwan and South Korea for the most advanced ones.
     
            While it is unclear what a potential Trump presidency could mean for Taiwan, Young says chip firms should strive to find a better way to work together for a mutually beneficial relationship. This is particularly important for TSMC, which is building three factories in Arizona but has faced headwinds in getting its facilities on track because of reasons ranging from different labor laws to work culture.
     
            “TSMC would have to figure out a way to put in place a manufacturing system that fits the culture of wherever it is building its fabs,” Young said, referring to fabrication plants where chips are made. “Only by doing so can TSMC truly become a global company.”

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/china-emperors-food-beijing-forbidden-city-intl-hnk/index.html,Tiger testicles and mythical banquets: What China’s emperors inside Beijing’s secretive Forbidden City really ate,It’s been a century since China’s last emperor was evicted from Beijing’s Forbidden City. A historian with rare access to the palace’s sealed archives lifts the lid on some of its culinary mysteries.,"Jul 16, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Maggie Hiufu Wong,China,"
            The Forbidden City was once one of the most powerful places on the planet. In 1420, while Europe was in the midst of the Hundred Years’ War and yet to discover America, China’s Ming Dynasty ruler was moving into his new home in the center of Beijing and beginning to strengthen his grip on an expanding empire.
     
            Inside their vast palace, China’s emperors were unassailable, protected not just by the miles of walls surrounding them, but by the extreme secrecy that governed the lives of the royalty within them. It was called the ‘Forbidden City’ because few Chinese subjects were allowed to enter.
     
            The last emperor was evicted in 1924. In the years that followed, as the world’s largest palace complex began to open its doors to the outside world, the enigmas of even the darkest corners of the Forbidden City were exposed to daylight.
     
            But one topic remains murky, even today: Food.
     
            Decades after the fall of imperial China, even as historians continue to collaborate to examine China’s past, very little is known about what was eaten in one the world’s richest and most powerful households – especially in the early days, as most of the ancient documents that might offer insights into the topic have been sealed off because of their fragile state.
     
            Zhao Rongguang, a food historian from the northern Chinese province of Heilongjiang, is one of the last few people – and quite possibly the only person – to have accessed and thoroughly studied all of them before they were locked away. This puts him in the rare position of being able to debunk many of the myths about palace cuisine that have persisted for decades.
     
            Zhao began delving into the Forbidden City’s culinary mysteries more than four decades ago.
     
            Beijing back in the 1980s was still a city of bicycles and backstreets – a far cry from the metropolis of skyscrapers and highways it is today.
     
            But it was also an exciting decade, as the country re-opened to the world – and Western culture – after leader Deng Xiaoping announced his “open door policy” in late 1978. It was the decade when Wham! became the first Western pop band to perform in China since 1949, and Paris’ iconic Maxim’s restaurant opened an outpost in Beijing.
     
            Zhao, now 76, wasn’t distracted by these new trends. He had saved up money from his teaching job to travel to Beijing to pursue his mission to find out what China’s ancient emperors and their families really ate.
     
            It wasn’t an easy task. In his path were two main obstacles. Firstly, the enduring secrecies of the palace – so little had been revealed to those outside its towering red walls during the five centuries it was occupied. Secondly, he says, food wasn’t considered a serious topic worthy of study in China, meaning documents focusing on what was eaten during the early days of palace life were scattered and scarce.
     
            Zhao persisted, returning summer after summer to what was then called the First Historical Archives of China, in the old palace’s Xihuamen, or West Prosperity Gate, where he pored over centuries-old imperial documents, which he believes were locked away in the 1990s.
     
            Slowly, he began to build up a picture of how dining in the Forbidden City evolved, zeroing in on three historical figures who were key to shaping royal eating habits. And now, nearly 40 years after he began his research, he has a pretty good idea.
     
            It all starts, Zhao tells CNN, with Kangxi, an emperor of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty that seized full control of China after 1644 when the Ming imperial family, aligned with China’s majority Han ethnic group, was ousted.
     
            Under his rule, between 1661 and 1722, the country entered into a relatively peaceful era following decades of dynastic fighting – and that led to some interesting menu changes inside the Forbidden City.
     
            At first, after the Qing Dynasty initially moved in, traditional foods from the nomadic Manchu heartlands of northeastern China were on the table, according to documents from the era studied by Zhao.
     
            In the mid-Kangxi reign, royal diets began to evolve.
     
            “There was still a lot of roast game and unusual foods on Kangxi’s table, like tiger testicles,” says Zhao.
     
            Tiger testicles?
     
            “Yes, you heard me right, tiger testicles. Ancient people thought that they had a libido-boosting effect. I believe Kangxi had eaten plenty of them as it was recorded officially that Kangxi had hunted more than 60 tigers in his life.”
     
            Rooster combs were another ingredient eaten as an aphrodisiac, says Zhao.
     
            But eventually, as society stabilized further during Kangxi’s rule, more ethnic Han dishes began to appear in the mix of palace offerings, like duck gizzard stew.
     
            The opaque world of Forbidden City dining gets a little clearer when we skip forward to Kangxi’s grandson, an imposing figure known as Qianlong Emperor.
     
            During his nearly 61 years on the throne (1735-1796) – a time Zhao considers the second important phase of the Forbidden City’s culinary evolution – Qianlong had his daily menus meticulously recorded, a paper trail that means historians can now reconstruct a more accurate view of the lifestyle in the palace at that time.
     
            Inside the Hong Kong Palace Museum, for instance, an ongoing exhibition titled “From dawn to dusk: Life in the Forbidden City” is heavily based on Qianlong Emperor’s daily rituals – meals included.
     
            “So what is the Forbidden City? It’s a city. It is an institution. Just like any community, food culture was an indispensable part of the entire culture inside the Forbidden City,” says Daisy Yiyou Wang, deputy director of the Hong Kong Palace Museum, a sister museum of Beijing’s Palace Museum at the Forbidden City.
     
            “The food culture itself reflects so much of the identity of the people. Their status and power and authority, and their taste, and relationships as well.”
     
            Among the exhibition’s displays is a bulky silver milk teapot that dates to the 18th or 19th century, sitting between a gleaming gold wine ewer with cloud and dragon reliefs and a glass bowl bearing exquisite gold threads.
     
            The elaborately painted teapot, with its gilded golden dragons, suggests that milk tea, a Manchu meal staple, was an essential part of the royal court’s diet during the Qing Dynasty.
     
            “Tea bricks would be broken into boiling water. Milk, butter and a pinch of salt were added. They then filtered the tea leaves out and then served the tea in this type of silver teapot,” says Nicole Chiang, the Hong Kong Palace Museum’s art historian and curator.
     
            The salted milk tea reflects the royal court’s Manchurian roots.
     
            “Even when Qianlong traveled to the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River where modern-day Hangzhou and Shanghai are), he hired a milk tea master from Mongolia to prepare milk tea for the court every day.”
     
            Chiang, who says she enjoys studying the Qing Dynasty due to the sheer number of historical artifacts preserved from that era, from texts to paintings, says the court also dined on hot pot - the traditional Chinese dish in which ingredients are cooked in a simmering bowl of soup stock right on the table.
     
            “One of the palace maids said that (the royal family) would have a hot pot dish almost every day for three months during wintertime. It was a popular dish,” says the historian, pointing to an enamel hot pot from the Forbidden City on display at the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
     
            Chiang, currently preparing for a future exhibition on food and travel in the Forbidden City, notes that though Emperor Qianlong had his menus recorded, it’s still challenging to study palace food history as most of the sealed-off documents have not been released to researchers and the public. (Her own exhibition is based on documents that have already been published by the Palace Museum.)
     
            As one of the few who have ever laid eyes on the archived documents, Zhao has had some of his research published in the last few decades. He continues to work and says he is now compiling a book based on all of his findings, which will further demystify the topic of palace cuisine.
     
            Through this wealth of knowledge, Zhao has been able to view the long-held beliefs about what was eaten inside the Forbidden City through a wider lens and add some much-needed context. And that includes the emperor’s supposed love for hot pot.
     
            “Menus were often presented to the emperor the night before for approval,” he says.
     
            “They reflected the personal tastes of the emperor – but were not solely based on his preferences. So we know Qianlong Emperor had hot pots – which were mostly written as ‘warm pots’ in the records. It could be because of the weather and tradition but it might not mean Qianlong loved them.”
     
            He says that in Qianlong Emperor’s time, imperial cuisine was much more refined and diverse – with both traditional Manchu dishes like roasted Asian roe deers and pheasants – as well as southern dishes, especially from the Jiangnan region.
     
            “The game on his menus showcases his northern roots,” says Zhao. “One of the dishes that appeared very often in his record was the Sika deer tail platter. The tail was quite a small part – but a wonderfully fat and fragrant part of a deer.”
     
            Smoked red-braised duck, fried spring bamboo shoots with pork and bird’s nest soup with rock sugar were some of the other regulars from the Jiangnan region that were frequently eaten in the Forbidden City.
     
            Qianlong Emperor, alongside other Qing Dynasty nobility, believed that bird’s nest soup – made with the solidified saliva of swallows – was extraordinarily nutritious. So much so that researchers believe he downed a bowl of it every morning before breakfast.
     
            “There are many myths and legends about bird’s nest. It was a relatively new ingredient at that time,” Zhao explains, noting that it didn’t appear in a major encyclopedia on traditional Chinese medicines published in the late 1500s.
     
            Based on the historical documents, Qianlong had two main meals per day. His breakfast was at around 6 a.m. and dinner at 2 p.m. But right after he woke up at 4 a.m., he would usually have a snack – such as bird’s nest soup – before his morning meal and work.
     
            At night, as he went through reports and requests from all over the country, he’d have another bite to eat at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. – often consisting of eight to 10 small dishes.
     
            “He usually dined alone except for the snack time at night, when he might be dining with a consort he was going to sleep with,” says Zhao.
     
            “To dine and sleep well – so he could produce offspring – were also two main tasks for the emperor.”
     
            Although being the ruler of the country did mean that he could enjoy the finest ingredients, he didn’t always indulge. And both Zhao and the experts at Hong Kong Palace Museum agree that dining inside the Forbidden City wasn’t as lavish as most people might assume.
     
            “The majority of (the emperors) grew up in a highly disciplined environment,” says Wang of the Hong Kong Palace Museum. “Their diet was supposed to be healthy and to be studied by a lot of people already and tested by history.”
     
            One of the biggest misunderstandings about dining in the Forbidden City, she says, is the assumption “that the emperors must eat like a million dishes, especially when you have that Manchu-Han Banquet rumor.”
     
            The myth of the extravagant Manchu-Han Banquet – often cited as an example of how the imperial family ate – was closely connected to Empress Dowager Cixi – a former royal concubine who controlled China ruthlessly for almost 50 years until she died in 1908.
     
            Cixi is largely responsible for the third and final stage of Zhao’s Forbidden City culinary research, but to understand how she accidentally contributed to one of the biggest misunderstandings about Chinese foods in modern days, it’s worth exploring the unique social and political situation in the decades leading up to China’s re-opening in the late 1970s.
     
            It was a period of political and economic isolation for mainland China following the Communists’ victorious emergence from a civil war in 1949.
     
            By accident, however, national culinary pride swelled toward one legendary banquet called the “Manchu-Han Feast” (or Man Han Quan Xi), which first appeared outside of the Forbidden City in the late Qing Dynasty and was popularized at an expo in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in the 1950s.
     
            “In 1957, at the first China Import and Export Fair in Guangzhou, one vendor had a sumptuous banquet spread for display,” says Zhao.
     
            “Out of the few foreign countries who sent their representatives, Japanese businessmen were intrigued. Japan’s economy happened to be recovering rapidly after World War II. They wanted to learn about this lavish feast and asked a staff member about what kind of feast it was.
     
            “The clueless helper then consulted the boss, also clueless, who asked the chef. The chef wasn’t sure either – but he had to give some answers, so he said ‘This is called the Manchu-Han Banquet and it was started by the emperor.’”
     
            The Japanese businessmen were said to have been fascinated.
     
            From then on, the Manchu-Han Feast became synonymous with emperors and their meals, and Zhao says it became one of the hottest food trends in Japan.
     
            Dozens of gourmets and research teams traveled to communist China to find out more about this mysterious imperial diet that technically didn’t actually exist.
     
            “While mainland China didn’t want to export such capitalistic ideals internationally originally, Hong Kong restaurateurs saw it as a great business opportunity,” says Zhao. (In those days, Hong Kong was under British rule.)
     
            In 1978, a Japanese TV station worked with a Hong Kong restaurant to recreate and live-broadcast a massive Manchu-Han feast. The epic banquet was separated into four meals over two days.
     
            That only served to deepen the myth, leading people to mistakenly believe the emperor’s feasts had to have 108 dishes spread across two days.
     
            After the country’s re-opening, proud chefs in mainland China soon began declaring they could do an even more opulent version of the feast – one of them featured 1,080 dishes in one banquet, says Zhao.
     
            The fascination with this mystified imperial Chinese cuisine spread across East Asia like wildfire. Not even Zhao was immune from it.
     
            “That’s why I decided to go find the truth myself,” says Zhao, noting the banquets are what got him curious about Forbidden City cuisine in the first place.
     
            So where does Empress Dowager Cixi fit into all this?
     
            Being the real holder of power behind the last few emperors of imperial China before her death, she was known for her extravagant lifestyle and appetite for exquisite Han Chinese foods.
     
            “It was the most lavish era during the Qing Dynasty. Their daily meals had increased from 18 to 23 courses to 25 to 28 courses,” says Zhao.
     
            She was also a keen entertainer, hosting regular ceremonial feasts. While there were no official Manchu-Han Banquets, there were other types of imperial feasts held in the Forbidden City throughout the centuries. None of them had as many dishes as the rumors claimed.
     
            The most iconic format of them all was “Tian An Yan” (translated as Increase Peacefulness Banquet), combining two main types of banquets of the past – the roast meat-heavy Manchu-style feasts and the Han style with bird’s nest soup and seafood.
     
            “Bird’s nest-style feasts featured many kinds of rare seafood products like shark fins, sea cucumbers, dried scallops and fish lips. Roast meat usually meant roast pork and roast duck,” says Zhao.
     
            “It was an invention during her time with strict guidelines. Each of these banquets consisted of two hot pot dishes, four big bowls (main dishes with auspicious words written on them), four small bowls of items, six food plates, two platters – like sliced Peking duck or suckling pig, four types of pastries and bao, one type of noodles, one type of soup and one fruit platter.
     
            “Hence, even the highest form of Tian An Yan during that time had around 28 dishes at best – a far cry from the 108 dishes modern media like to portray,” says Zhao.
     
            In a society with an increasing reputation for debauchery under Cixi’s corrupt government towards the end of imperial China, wealthy patrons began creating their own “imperial banquets” inspired by Tian An Yan, and called them “Manchu-Han Banquets.” This helps explain some of the confusion surrounding their connection to China’s emperors.
     
            Despite having studied food for decades, Zhao is far from being a foodie. Quite the opposite, in fact – he says his obsession with food history stems from horrors he witnessed during his childhood in the three years of famine that followed the Communist leadership’s Great Leap Forward economic policy in the late 1950s.
     
            “The memory of long-term gastrointestinal cramps due to hunger and the shock of the millions of deaths due to hunger in the 1960s are a nightmare that comes back and haunts me from time to time,” says Zhao.
     
            “I’m lucky that I survived and it deeply affected my perspective on food.”
     
            Because of this, he says he believes understanding the past will improve the world’s future food security.
     
            “Studying food history is a part of understanding our food culture in a truthful way,” Zhao says.
     
            “It doesn’t only help a country promote its culinary arts but helps us reflect on food and the policies we have today. Who doesn’t enjoy good food? But I didn’t become a food historian to indulge but out of consciousness and responsibility, I want to firmly grasp the truth about it. Today is a continuation of yesterday so studying history is an important part of who we are today and in the future.”

            As dramatic images of the failed assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump spread around the world Saturday, news of the attack also sparked immerse online interest – as well as pointed criticism of the US – on China’s heavily censored internet.
     
            Discussion of the assassination attempt, in which a gunman opened fire at a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday evening, dominated Chinese social media in the hours after the attack.
     
            Related hashtags garnered hundreds of millions of views on China’s X-like social media platform Weibo, where Trump – who as president played an outsized role reframing the US-China relationship into the more contentious one that exists today – has for years been a frequent subject of discussion, fascination and often ridicule.
     
            Some social media users were quick to hail former president and presumptive Republican US presidential nominee as “lucky” that he didn’t sustain more serious injury and praised Trump’s “quick reflexes,” while many others made quips about how the situation would boost his re-election bid.
     
            Trump, who said he was shot in the ear, was declared safe following the incident.
     
            As shots rang out during his speech at the rally, the former president ducked to the ground and was covered by Secret Service agents. He then raised his fist in a defiant pose with blood visible on his face before agents took him off the stage – a gesture captured in an image widely shared worldwide and in China.
     
            “Just judging by his quick reaction and agility to duck, I’d vote for Trump. I bet (US President Joe) Biden would take ages to crouch down,” read one social media comment that got thousands of likes and appeared to allude to concerns about Biden’s age.
     
            One blogger with over a million followers noted that the incident made Trump look more like a “a traditional Hollywood president.”
     
            Other commentators made morbid parallels between the incident and the 2022 assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, for example noting that the two ex-leaders did not end up “meeting” over the weekend.
     
            There were also repeated links made between the attack and recurring instances of gun violence in the United States, which are often highlighted by Chinese state media as an example of the country’s failings.

            “In the land of liberty, gunshots ring out every day,” said one comment on Weibo with several thousand likes, while another said Trump would be “confirmed as the next president with gunfire.”
     
            China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs put forward an official comment Sunday, with a spokesperson saying Chinese leader Xi Jinping “expressed sympathy” to Trump.
     
            State-linked media also stepped in to shape public discussion around the incident. Several op-eds or editorials published by such outlets framed Saturday’s violence as a symptom of American democracy, echoing Beijing’s longstanding rhetorical push to portray the US political system as dysfunctional and inferior to its own.
     
            An editorial published by the state-linked Beijing News on Sunday claimed the incident had “combined all the political symbols typical of an American election: violence, uncertainty, and tough guys.”
     
            State-run nationalist tabloid Global Times on Monday published an op-ed from a Beijing-based professor describing how “the escalation of political polarization into violence shows that more people are feeling hopeless about American democracy.”
     
            “Political polarization and violence stem from severe income inequality and hopelessness about social change,” the piece said, while the outlet’s English-language arm repeated similar themes in an editorial for international audiences.
     
            As such commentary filtered across China’s media, Biden, in an Oval Office address Sunday evening, took aim at what he described as “foreign actors” who “fan the flames of our division.

            Their aim is “to shape the outcomes consistent with their interests, not ours,” Biden said in an apparent reference to Washington’s concern that China, Russia and other rivals are playing on existing social divisions in the US in influence campaigns, something Beijing denies.
     
            “Tonight, I’m asking every American to recommit …. (to) think about what’s made America so special,” the US president said.
     
            The rapt focus on the attempted assassination in China adds to what has already been frequent discussion of Trump on the Chinese internet, where he earned the nickname “Chuan Jianguo,” or “Trump, the (Chinese) nation builder” during his time in office – a quip to suggest his isolationist foreign policy and divisive domestic agenda were actually helping Beijing to overtake Washington on the global stage.
     
            Trump’s re-election bid is also believed to be watched closely in Beijing, not least because the former president has threatened, if re-elected, to raise tariffs that experts say could trigger a de facto decoupling between the US and Chinese economies – a shock that would hit as China grapples with numerous internal fiscal challenges.

            After months of unexplained delay, top officials from China’s ruling Communist Party are gathering in Beijing this week to signal the direction forward for the world’s second largest economy as it faces major economic challenges and friction with the West.
     
            Stakes are high for the meeting, which takes place every five years and is known as China’s third plenum. It has historically been a platform for the party’s leadership to announce key economic reforms and policy directives.
     
            China is grappling with a property sector crisis, high local government debt and weak consumer demand — as well as flagging investor confidence and intensifying trade and technology tensions with the United States and Europe.
     
            Those challenges were underscored by its latest economic growth data, which were announced Monday. China’s gross domestic product expanded by 4.7% in the April to June months, compared to the previous year.
     
            That represents a slowdown from the 5.3% growth reported for the first quarter and also missed the expectations of a group of economists polled by Reuters who had predicted 5.1% expansion in the second quarter.
     
            Economic problems on the back of years of stringent pandemic controls have triggered mounting social frustration, as well as questions about the direction of the country under Xi Jinping, its most powerful leader in decades.
     
            Those questions have been underscored by a recent shake-up in the upper echelons of Xi’s government that saw three ministers and a handful of top military officers removed from posts or investigated, a situation that some observers of China’s opaque political system believe contributed to the plenum’s delay.
     
            How Xi and his top officials ﻿choose to address the country’s economic challenges will have significant impact on whether they can continue to raise quality of life, and public confidence, within China.
     
            They could also have a broad impact on the country’s role in the global economy and how willing foreign investors will be to do business there as uncertainties, including the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, loom.
     
            Here’s what to expect at the four-day gathering, which begins Monday.
     
            About 200 members of the party’s Central Committee leadership body as well as 170 alternate committee members are gathering in Beijing to approve a document laying out a plan on “deepening reform” and advancing “Chinese-style modernization,” according to state media.
     
            Past third plenums have delivered sweeping reforms.
     
            The meeting in 1978 was linked to the landmark shift toward the “reform and opening” of China’s economy, while Xi’s first third plenum as leader in 2013 set in motion the move to dismantle the decades-old one child policy.
     
            But observers of China’s opaque political machine don’t believe there will be fundamental economic reforms this time around.
     
            Instead, they will be watching for more targeted efforts to address structural economic issues and social problems — and to enhance China’s technological self-reliance at a time when it faces a raft of restrictions on access to technology driven by the US.
     
            This is Xi’s third time overseeing this meeting after he extended his rule into a norm-breaking second decade at the last Party Congress in 2022.
     
            Speculation has swirled around why the meeting, which was widely expected to take place last fall, is only happening now.
     
            Some observers suggested the flagging economy and internal disagreement over how to address it, as well as the high-level personnel shake-ups that cast a shadow over Xi’s third term, could have played a role.
     
            The high debt loads held by local governments and their shrinking income, linked to an ongoing property sector crisis, lie at the heart of China’s current economic woes.
     
            They’ll also be looking for signals on a new direction for real estate development and property sector policy in the wake of the industry crisis that’s seen dozens of Chinese developers default on their debts, which has, in turn, devastated investors, homebuyers and construction workers.
     
            Observers will be watching for fiscal reforms, especially around taxation and government spending, that could reduce pressure on local governments and bolster their revenue.

            Many also say the government should take steps to boost consumer spending and increase household income, including potential reforms to change rural land ownership and China’s restrictive household registration system, as well as to expand social safety nets in a country grappling with high medical costs and a rapidly aging population.
     
            Xi has acknowledged economic hardship in China, saying in a New Year’s speech that “some people” had “difficulty finding jobs and meeting basic needs.” In a May speech, he also stressed that the party should “do more practical things that benefit the people’s livelihood,” adding that reform should give people a sense of “gain.”
     
            While chasing rapid economic growth is “no longer Beijing’s singular priority,” Asia Society Center for China Analysis experts Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote last week, Xi likely recognizes that his priorities of national security and tech self-reliance “must co-exist with a baseline level of growth that sustains consumption, investment, social stability, and his own political security.”
     
            Tech self-reliance has become a key focus for Beijing as the US and its allies have moved to limit China’s access to high-end technologies, citing their own security concerns.
     
            The plenum is expected to greenlight more government coordination around Xi’s plan to build China into a “science and technology power,” both in terms of innovation as well as industry.
     
            But such a focus also threatens to heighten frictions with the West.
     
            The EU and the US have recently slapped hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, saying they are unfairly subsidized by the government and flooding global markets. Any moves this week that bolster the production of such high-end green technologies, which also include goods like solar panels or batteries, could further inflame the issue.
     
            Meanwhile, global investors will be looking for Beijing to make good on promises to further open up its market, even as many firms have become more wary of doing business in the country as Xi has prioritized heightened state control and security.
     
            The plenum could also see the formal ousting of top Communist Party officials who have been ensnared in opaque disciplinary investigations or removed from posts without explanation, some of whom were linked to an apparent military purge.
     
            Li Shangfu, China’s former defense minister who was fired from his role in October and expelled from the Communist Party following a corruption investigation, will likely be formally removed from the Central Committee.
     
            Observers will be watching closely for any similar movement around other ousted government and military officials, including former Foreign Minister Qin Gang, People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force commander Li Yuchao and his political commissar Xu Zhongbo.

            Germany will phase out components made by China’s Huawei and ZTE from its 5G wireless network over the next five years, a move that risks worsening its already strained relations with the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            Mobile network operators including Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica have agreed to remove the components from their 5G “core networks” — which are connected to the internet and operate as control centers — by the end of 2026.
     
            By the end of 2029, these components must also be purged from “access and transport networks,” which include the physical parts of the 5G network such as transmission lines and towers.
     
            “In this way, we are protecting the central nervous systems of Germany as a business location — and we are protecting the communication of citizens, companies, and the state,” Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in a statement Thursday. “We must reduce security risks and, unlike in the past, avoid one-sided dependencies.”
     
            In the same statement, the German government underlined the importance of “secure and resilient telecommunications infrastructure,” given the “dangers of sabotage and espionage.”
     
            “In order to avoid critical vulnerabilities and dependencies, trustworthy manufacturers must therefore be relied upon,” it added.
     
            Huawei told CNN in a statement that “there is no specific evidence or scenario” that its technology has cybersecurity risks. “We will continue to cooperate with customers and partners in a constructive and open manner, promote the improvement and progress of cybersecurity, and promote the construction of mobile networks and digitalization in Germany,” the company added.
     
            CNN could not reach ZTE for comment.

Germany blocks another big business deal with China
 
            The Chinese embassy in Germany on Thursday pledged to take “necessary measures” to safeguard the interests of Chinese companies.
     
            Germany’s move “seriously damages mutual trust between the two sides, and will also affect future cooperation between China and Europe in related fields,” it said in a statement.
     
            The decision could further strain Germany’s relationship with China, its biggest trading partner. Last week, Berlin blocked the sale of a Volkswagen subsidiary to a Chinese state-owned company on national security grounds, drawing a rebuke from Beijing. China is also locked in a trade spat with the European Union, which hiked tariffs on Chinese electric cars last month.
     
            A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that “turning economic, trade and technological issues into politics will only disrupt normal technological exchanges.”
     
            Germany has been dragging its feet for years over what to do with Huawei components in its 5G network after the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan effectively banned the company from building their 5G networks amid fears that Beijing could use Chinese tech companies to spy on their citizens.
     
            The US also placed Huawei on a trade restriction list in 2019, which made it harder for the company to obtain semiconductor chips from American suppliers. Those restrictions were tightened further earlier this year.
     
            According to Huawei’s annual report, Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 21% of its revenue last year.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/nato-chinese-owned-infrastructure-europe/index.html,NATO allies are discussing reclaiming some Chinese-owned infrastructure in Europe,"NATO officials are discussing taking action to reclaim some Chinese owned infrastructure projects in Europe should a wider conflict with Russia break out in the east of the continent, three officials involved in the discussions told CNN.","Jul 11, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Kayla Tausche,China,"
            NATO officials are discussing taking action to reclaim some Chinese-owned infrastructure projects in Europe should a wider conflict with Russia break out in the east of the continent, three officials involved in the discussions told CNN.
     
            A decade ago, when Europe was still crawling out of the economic crater caused by the global financial crisis, the promise of infrastructure funding from Chinese-owned investment firms seemed like a major windfall.
     
            Now, with the largest land war being waged in Europe since World War II – and the West warning of Beijing’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – NATO countries now see those investments as a liability, with allies beginning to discuss ways to reclaim some of those projects, the officials said.
     
            The fear, according to one US official, is that Beijing could use the infrastructure it owns in Europe to provide material assistance to Russia if the conflict were to expand. The goal, officials said, is to figure out a path forward well in advance of any potential conflict.
     
            The discussions reflect an increasing focus on China by the NATO alliance. The joint declaration released Wednesday by the 32 leaders, at the Washington 75th anniversary summit, strongly called out Beijing’s support for Moscow, in a move seen as a sign of progress by members eager to take a tougher stance against Beijing after such a reference was omitted in 2023.
     
            “The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order,” the declaration states, “are a cause for profound concern.”
     
            The discussions on taking action on infrastructure, according to three officials involved in them, are still in their early stages and have seen varying levels of involvement among the NATO member countries. One NATO diplomat suggested the US, which is spearheading the discussions, would need to pursue the discussions on a bilateral basis to secure the necessary support.
     
            From rail lines connecting Eastern Europe to China, to ports located in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, China has funded tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure investments under its Belt & Road Initiative, which European nations began signing onto in 2013.
     
            A NATO official said that if a war erupted, the infrastructure “would almost certainly be nationalized, or nations would temporarily assume operating control, under emergency security measures. China can sue them in court after the fact.”
     
            US officials see a precedent for such takeovers or sales in moves by European nations to force Russia to sell assets in the wake of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. For more than a year, Finland repeatedly blocked the business of Helsinki Shipyard – a producer of ice-breaking ships once owned by a Russian entity – until Russia in late 2023 sold the company to an entity based in Canada.
     
            A senior US official says the discussions have expanded beyond low-tech to include high-tech interests as well, like quantum computing, semiconductors, and telecom infrastructure.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the Ukraine war could be the reason that European and Asian nations have become clear-eyed about their security being tied to one another.
     
            “Maybe this was crystallized by Ukraine, when Prime Minister Kishida of Japan said that what’s happening in Europe today could be happening in East Asia tomorrow. When Russia committed its aggression, its renewed aggression against Ukraine, and Japan stood up, South Korea stood up, Australia, New Zealand, this was a reflection of that recognition that these challenges are linked,” Blinken said at the NATO forum.
     
            But while most NATO member states have expressed some level of concern about Chinese-owned infrastructure, two officials involved in the discussions tell CNN that France in particular has sought to shift the discussions on infrastructure to the European Union, which has authority on other economic matters.
     
            Tension from France and other countries, officials say, impacted the language in the declaration with the countries arguing that NATO is not the best platform from which to challenge China – but many member states still harbor a very real fear that Beijing could utilize the hard assets against the alliance in the future, and continue pushing for the alliance to defend against the threat.
     
            Speaking in Washington in mid-June ahead of the summit, outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Beijing must face consequences for its support of Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine.

            China is a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, NATO leaders said Wednesday, as the defense alliance hardens its stance on Beijing and the “systemic challenges” they say it poses to their countries’ security.
     
            The joint declaration marks NATO’s most pointed tone yet on China’s role in a war that has galvanized the 75-year-old bloc, which celebrated its anniversary this week at a three-day leaders’ summit in Washington hosted by US President Joe Biden.
     
            China’s “no limits” partnership with Russia and its “large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base” are enabling Moscow to wage its war, the NATO leaders’ statement said, as they urged Beijing to “cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort.”
     
            The US and European leaders in recent months have accused China of bolstering Russia’s defense sector with the export of dual-use goods. Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.
     
            The NATO leaders also elaborated to a greater extent than in the past on concerns over China’s growing capabilities and activities in outer space, and reiterated their previous unease about what they called Beijing’s “malicious cyber and hybrid activities,” including disinformation, and “rapidly” expanding nuclear arsenal.
     
            “We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency with the view of safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests,” the statement said, referring to China by the initials of its official name.
     
            “At the same time, we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC’s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.”
     
            The NATO leaders’ declaration Wednesday comes as the 32-member alliance - historically focused on security in North America and Europe - has in recent years upped its engagement with US allies in Asia and increasingly seen its security as linked to the region, even as member countries have pursued divergent policies toward China.
     
            For the third consecutive year, leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea attended the NATO leaders’ summit in another sign of closer ties between the bloc and those countries, as well as Australia.
     
            Beijing has deepened political, economic and military ties with Moscow since President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 declared a “no limits” partnership – and their shared opposition to what they said was NATO’s expansion – during the Russian leader’s visit to the Chinese capital, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
     
            China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia’s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its economy, which has been heavily sanctioned in the wake of that invasion, while the two nuclear-armed neighbors have continued to hold joint military exercises.
     
            Meanwhile, China has claimed neutrality in the war and sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker, even as the US and European leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is Beijing’s backing of Moscow through its economic and diplomatic support, as well as the provision of dual-use goods.

            On Thursday, China criticized the NATO statement as “filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric,” and said it was “provocative with obvious lies and smears.”
     
            “China is not the creator to the Ukraine crisis. China’s position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard. We aim to promote peace talks and seek political settlement,” a statement from its mission to the European Union said.
     
            The Chinese statement also reiterated Beijing’s position that it has never provided lethal weapons in the conflict and has strict dual-use export controls, defending its trade with Russia as “normal.”
     
            The US and European leaders have in recent months raised alarm that such exports are revitalizing Russia’s defense sector and allowing it to survive despite hefty international sanctions. The US has said that dual-use exports have specifically enabled the production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.
     
            Both the US and the EU have sanctioned Chinese entities they allege are supporting the war effort.
     
            Later Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry also condemned the declaration, with a spokesperson framing NATO as a “great threat” to the world and reiterating Beijing’s claim that the alliance was “fanning the flames” of the war in Ukraine.
     
            The NATO leaders’ declaration is the latest step in what has been the bloc’s gradual hardening of tone on China in recent years.
     
            NATO leaders first mentioned the need to jointly address “opportunities and challenges” posed by China in a 2019 declaration, before moving to refer to “systemic challenges” the country poses in 2021.
     
            That shift has come alongside an increased US policy focus on the Indo-Pacific amid a deepening rivalry with Beijing as China under Xi’s leadership has grown increasingly aggressive in the region and in its broader foreign policy.
     
            NATO’s attention on Asia has also been accelerated over the past two and a half years by hardening geopolitical fault lines in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin’s tightening relationship with not only China but also North Korea and Iran.
     
            NATO leaders on Wednesday also said Pyongyang and Tehran were “fueling” Russia’s war through “direct military support,” and condemned North Korea’s exports of “artillery shells and ballistic missiles” to Russia – which multiple governments say they have tracked since last year when Putin hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Russian Far East.

            “The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security,” the leaders said in their declaration.
     
            “We are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation, and technology,” it said.
     
            Beijing has watched warily as NATO’s engagement grows with other powers in the Asia-Pacific. China is widely seen by observers as hoping to be the dominant force in the region and to push back on the US presence there, as Washington bolsters its longstanding Indo-Pacific security partnerships and interests.
     
            China and Russia have also converged over their shared opposition to NATO, part of a broader aspiration from both to reshape a world order they see as unfairly dominated by the US, and both have blamed the Western security alliance for provoking Moscow to invade Ukraine.
     
            In its statement Thursday, Beijing’s EU mission called on NATO to “correct its wrong perception of China,” and “abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game.”
     
            “The Asia-Pacific region is a place for peaceful development, not a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition … NATO should not become the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,” the statement said.

            The Chinese government said Wednesday that it would investigate whether the European Union’s probes into Chinese companies constitute “trade barriers.”
     
            Concerns are rising in the West that jobs and strategically important industries could be wiped out by cheap Chinese imports propped up by government subsidies. Earlier this year, the EU launched investigations into China’s state support for its wind turbine and solar panel suppliers. It has also recently completed an eight-month-long probe into Beijing’s support for makers of electric vehicles, resulting in additional tariffs on EVs imported from China.
     
            Now, China will investigate if the bloc’s probes violate the two sides’ economic treaty and if they have hurt the country’s trade with the 27 EU member states.
     
            The investigation by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) will span a number of sectors, including rail, photovoltaics, wind power, and security inspection equipment, according to a statement posted on its website.
     
            If MOFCOM deems that the EU’s probes amount to “trade barriers,” it can start negotiations with the EU, launch a multilateral dispute resolution process, or take other “appropriate measures” to address the issue, according to rules published by the ministry in 2005.

            The announcement comes just days after the provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the EU came into effect. Talks between the two sides are expected to continue — if no agreement is reached, the tariffs will become definitive in November.
     
            Beijing has spoken out strongly against the EU tariffs, saying it will make “all necessary moves” to safeguard China’s interests. Last month, it opened a probe into pork imported from the bloc and it is also investigating European brandy imports.
     
            According to Wednesday’s announcement, MOFCOM is launching its latest investigation in response to a June request by an industry group in China. The probe is expected to end by January 10, the statement said.
     
            During the process, the ministry can use questionnaires, hearings, and on-site checks among other methods, the statement added.

            The world’s largest indoor ice and snow theme park has officially opened its doors to the public, giving visitors to the city of Harbin in northeast China a chance to feel wintery temperatures year-round.
     
            The country’s northernmost metropolis, Harbin is the capital of Heilongjiang province. Also known as the Ice City, it experiences long, cold and snowy winters with short, cool summers. The annual Harbin Ice and Snow Festival began in 1999 and is held every year from December to early March.
     
            A Guinness World Records official awarded the Harbin Ice and Snow World Company the certification for the “world’s largest indoor ice and snow theme park” during this month’s opening ceremony.
     
            Ironically, the opening coincided with a heat wave in Harbin, with outdoor temperatures peaking at 29 degrees C (84 F), while the indoor theme park maintained a chilly -8 C to -12 C (17.6 F to 10.4 F) temperature.
     
            Covering an area of 23,800 square meters, the new Harbin Ice and Snow World Park, which opened on July 6, is divided into nine themed sections with 13 interactive projects. Utilizing advanced ice sculpting techniques and incorporating cutting-edge lighting, sound and interactive technologies, the park offers an immersive experience.
     
            The ice used in the construction of the park’s attractions was sourced from the Songhua River, with a total ice volume of 20,000 cubic meters. Once inside, visitors can enjoy a magical atmosphere filled with ice, light, entertainment, gourmet food and cultural creations. There are also vibrant ice sculptures of fruit, ice cream and cakes made using edible dyes through an environmentally-friendly special coloring process.
     
            Harbin’s annual snow and ice festival brings tens of thousands of tourists from China and elsewhere, but this new attraction is aimed at extending the city’s tourist season and transforming it into a year-round destination.

            China’s BYD, which vies with Tesla for the title of the world’s top maker of battery electric vehicles, has agreed to build a $1 billion car factory in Turkey, the Turkish government has announced.
     
BYD’s CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey’s Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kaci signed the agreement in Istanbul, according to a statement from the Turkish ministry Monday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the signing ceremony, it said.
     
            “We aim to meet the growing demand for new-energy vehicles in the region and reach consumers in Europe,” the statement cited BYD representatives as saying.
     
            The announcement came just days after provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the European Union came into effect. The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are aimed at stopping a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what the EU deems unfair support from the government.
     
            Turkey is in a customs union with the EU. That means vehicles can be exported from the country to the trading bloc tariff-free.
     
            According to the agreement with Turkey, BYD will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will be able to produce 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles annually, and set up a research and development center for sustainable mobility technologies at the plant.
     
            The factory is expected to start production at the end of 2026 and provide as many as 5,000 jobs in the country.

            CNN has reached out to BYD for comment but hasn’t received a response.
     
            The EU’s decision earlier this year imposed an extra 17.4% tariff on the vehicles BYD ships from China to the bloc, which also has a standard 10% duty on all car imports.
     
            Talks between the EU and China are expected to continue but, if no agreement is reached, the additional tariffs will become definitive in November.
     
            BYD already announced in December that it would build an EV factory in EU member Hungary, becoming the first major Chinese automaker to build passenger cars in Europe.

            Beijing has intensified its anti-dumping investigation into imports of European brandy.
     
            The Chinese commerce ministry will hold a hearing on July 18 to discuss the probe into claims that European producers are selling brandy in China at artificially low prices, according to a statement from the ministry Friday.
     
            The hearing will focus on the reasons behind lower prices and any damage they’ve caused to the Chinese liquor industry, the ministry said.
     
            The announcement came on the same day as the European Commission’s additional provisional tariffs on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles came into effect. The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are seen as a necessary move by the EU to deter a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what it deems unfair support from the government.
     
            On Saturday, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a state-backed auto association, said it was “strongly dissatisfied” with the additional EU tariffs on Chinese EVs and considered them “unacceptable.”
     
            Major stakeholders are bracing for retaliatory moves by Beijing.
     
            China’s probe into Europe’s cognac is a tit-for-tat reaction to EU action on Chinese EVs, said Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH (LVMH), at an economic conference on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. LVMH owns major cognac brand Hennessy.

            “You can be a regional player with a very particular role in globalisation, as in our case, and regardless find yourself hostage to a number of conflicts that have nothing to do with your activities,” he said.
     
            French congac producers will be hit hard if China imposes any tariffs after the probe. Last year, 99% of China’s imported brandy came from France, reaching $1.74 billion in value, according to Chinese customs data.
     
            The Chinese government announced the anti-dumping probe against European brandy in January, in what was seen as a retaliation against the EU’s decision to investigate whether Chinese EV manufacturers receive unfair state subsidies.
     
            The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, announced last month that it would hike tariffs on Chinese EVs. Talks between the two sides are expected to continue but, if no agreement is reached, the tariffs will become definitive in November.
     
            The tariffs would become definitive in November if no alternative resolution is reached.
     
            Beijing has said it will take “all necessary measures” to safeguard China’s interests. Apart from brandy, such measures could include retaliatory moves against imports of EU pork.
     
            “China has already launched a targeted anti-dumping probe on pork imports. The findings of an investigation into EU spirits are due early next year but could come anytime,” said Bank of America analysts in a research note Monday.
     
            “Beijing has warned it could hit European agricultural goods, aviation and cars with large engines,” they added.

            A fashion major from a vocational high school in rural China has amazed the nation by outshining elite students in a global math contest – but the teenager’s underdog story has now been mired by controversy.
     
            Jiang Ping, born in a poor village in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, ranked 12th out of 802 shortlisted competitors – mostly from prestigious institutions such as Harvard, Oxford, and MIT – in first-round results released on June 13 by DAMO Academy, the organizer of the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition.
     
            Launched in 2018 by Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, the free online contest is open to math enthusiasts worldwide, though Chinese math majors typically dominate the top places. This year’s top 85 finishers will win prizes from $2,000 to $30,000.
     
            Jiang’s high placement – in the first of the contest’s two rounds – was a remarkable achievement for a student from one of the country’s vocational schools, which suffer deep-seated social prejudices and whose graduates occupy the lowest rungs of China’s educational hierarchy.
     
            Her success initially garnered nationwide acclaim, with multiple Chinese state media outlets jumping on the story and a deluge of online commentary buoyed by seeing a vocational student do so well in an international math competition.
     
            But doubts about the 17-year-old’s math skills have gained momentum online since the end of last month, ahead of the release next month of results from the much more challenging second round. The organizing committee has yet to address them.
     
            Jiang’s gift for math came to the fore in junior high, where her scores far outstripped those of her peers, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. She was later trained by math teacher Wang Runqiu at Lianshu Secondary Vocational School, where she studies fashion design.
     
            Wang, a three-time finalist in the contest, helped Jiang to teach herself advanced math over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
     
            Since Jiang’s top-20 finish in the first round was announced, a related hashtag topped searches on X-like platform Weibo, amassing more than 650 million views so far. In her hometown, her image beamed from television screens at local malls.
     
            Jiang finished the final round on June 22, and the results will be released in August.
     
            However, just a day after the final, Richard Xu from Harvard Business School, who placed 190th in the first round, announced on China’s Quora-type site Zhihu that he, along with 38 other contestants, had filed a joint letter to the organizing committee asking for an independent investigation into Jiang and Wang’s answer sheets from the qualifying round.
     
            The letter cites “evidence” of alleged fraud, including a theory of “collaborative cheating” headed by Wang, who came 125th.
     
            Four days before the final round, Yin Wotao, a member of the organizing committee, had defended Jiang in a soon-deleted response to a skeptic on X.
     
            “Some math amateurs have indeed placed well in the qualifying rounds in past years,” given the moderate difficulty and generous 48-hour time limit, Yin argued.
     
            Blocked from accessing Yin’s short-lived comments by Chinese internet restrictions, users posted on the Lianshui county government’s website, demanding an official investigation into Jiang and Wang.
     
            On June 27, the local government confirmed what until that point had been an online rumor that Jiang scored only 83 out of 150 in a school math exam held after the qualifying round. The next day, it provided a formulaic response to further related queries, saying “the investigation is underway.”
     
            Soon after, all the posts relating to Jiang were taken down and there’s been no update since.
     
            In response to CNN’s inquiries on June 28, organizing committee member Yin declined to comment without the green light from DAMO Academy, his employer.
     
            CNN has reached out to the academy for comment and could not reach Jiang and her teacher Wang.
     
            Among the cacophony of commentary, some suspect the harsh public scrutiny of Jiang is rooted in social prejudice against vocational students.
     
            “The fact that Jiang, the vocational student, has garnered so much public attention per se mirrors social discontent with China’s education system,” Zhao Yong, distinguished professor in educational psychology at the University of Kansas, told CNN.
     
            These students make up the bottom 40% in China’s senior high school entrance exam, or “zhongkao.” They do not qualify to enter regular high schools, where students cram for “gaokao,” China’s notoriously daunting college entrance exam.

            In a society where poor academic performance is often equated with moral failings, “lazy bones,” “small-timers,” and “delinquents” have become bywords for the cohort who perform poorly on the zhongkao at 15 and are generally resigned to toil in factories for the rest of their lives.
     
            This represents a stark reversal from the 1980s and 90s when vocational schooling was respected as a sought-after path to “iron rice bowls,” a popular term for secure jobs, amid the country’s urgent need for technical workers. However, the boom soon died down as higher education expanded in 1999.
     
            As China races to meet its ambitious “Made in China 2025” goal to become “a world manufacturing power,” Beijing has been strengthening vocational education in recent years. But structural discrimination in China’s schools, universities and workplaces means society still favors academic degrees over trades.
     
            In an interview with The Beijing News, a Communist Party-owned newspaper, Jiang said she wanted to go college and that her dream school was Zhejiang University, a top academy in the e-commerce hub Hangzhou. But that could still be difficult despite her apparent maths proficiency.
     
            Jiang’s mentor Wang told the state-run Xinhua Daily that due to restrictions on major choices for future vocational education, she can only apply to three colleges in Jiangsu province, with her best option being a second-tier public university.
     
            “China selects and categorizes talents way too early and too rigidly. This has greatly limited individuals’ future options and paths,” said Zhao, citing Germany and Finland as better examples of dual-track schooling with greater flexibility for students to shift between vocational and academic tracks.
     
            Beijing’s attempt to emulate those European nations by encouraging resource exchanges between the two types of schools over the past decade has met a lukewarm response from high schools busy coaching students to score higher in the “gaokao” university entrance exam.
     
            According to Zhao, Jiang is already “a lucky rarity if she’s truly gifted in math.” But he warned she may become a “disappeared Einstein” – one of the many buried talents in China’s education system.
     
            The jury is still out, with second-round results due next month.
     
            Jiang considers math her “Plan B,” prioritizing fashion design for future study, according to The Beijing News.
     
            Zhao said working in a factory is a “reasonable choice” for the 17-year-old village girl, who as a vocational student has limited options for higher education.
     
            “After all, she has a mouth to feed,” he said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,What is China’s ‘monster’ coast guard ship and why is the Philippines spooked by it?,China anchored one of its two “monster” coast guard ships inside the Philippines’ EEZ last week in what a Philippine official called an act of “intimidation.”,"Jul 8, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Brad Lendon,China,"
            China anchored one of its two “monster” coast guard ships inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) last week in what a Philippine official called an act of “intimidation” in the ongoing territorial dispute between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea.
     
            Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the China Coast Guard vessel CCG-5901 anchored near Sabina Shoal in the Spratly Islands, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of the Philippine island of Palawan on July 3, well within Manila’s 230-mile EEZ.
     
            Displacing 12,000 tons and with a length of 541 feet, CCG-5901 is three times the size of the United States Coast Guard’s main patrol vessels, the National Security Cutters - leading many observers to refer to the Chinese vessel as “The Monster.”
     
            While at Sabina Shoal, the Chinese ship anchored within 800 yards of one of the Philippine Coast Guard’s newest and biggest ships previously deployed to the area, Tarriela said in a post on X.
     
            CCG-5901 is more than five times the size of the Philippine ship, the BRP Teresa Magbanua.
     
            “It’s an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard,” Tarriela said during a forum on Saturday, according to a Reuters report.
     
            But he said the Philippines would not back down on its South China Sea claims.
     
            “We’re not going to pull out, and we’re not going to be intimidated,” Tarriela added.
     
            When asked the Philippine claims during a regular press briefing Monday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the area in question was part of the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
     
            “China’s military and police ships patrolling and enforcing the law in the waters near Xianbin Jiao are in compliance with China’s domestic law and international law,” spokesperson Lin Jian said, using the Chinese term for the Sabina Shoal.
     
China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims.
     
            In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.
     
            But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships – reinforced by militia boats – involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.
     
            A clash near Second Thomas Shoal in June saw Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat. A Filipino soldier lost a thumb during the confrontation.
     
            CCG-5901 wasn’t involved in that incident but has been prowling areas of the Philippines’ EEZ since, according to Ray Powell, a South China Sea expert and director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University.
     
            “Immediately following the dramatic standoff at Second Thomas Shoal … The Monster toured nearly every Philippine outpost and key feature in the South China Sea,” Powell said.
     
            Powell and other analysts say intimidation is one of the main jobs of the CCG-5901, which is larger than any regular coast guard ship in the world (a specialty US Coast Guard icebreaker is bigger) and even outsizes US Navy destroyers.
     
            The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers displace 9,700 tons or less and are about 35 feet shorter than CCG-5901.
     
            The US Coast Guard’s National Security Cutters, displace 4,500 tons, a third of the size of CCG-5901.
     
            In a firepower comparison, CCG-5901 also betters the US cutters, with two main 76.2-millimeters guns compared to one main 57-millimeter gun on the US ships.
     
            “Its massive size enables it to intimidate its neighbors while avoiding the escalatory implications of sending a gray-hulled military vessel,” Powell said, referring to navy ships.
     
            Coast guards, known as white-hulled vessels because of their color, are usually assigned to law enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. In most countries, they are not normally expected to participate in military operations.
     
            The US Coast Guard, for instance, is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department, although US Coast Guard vessels can come under US Navy control in certain scenarios.
     
            The China Coast Guard is part of the country’s People’s Armed Police, which is under the command of the Central Military Commission.
     
            Analysts say that’s a key difference between the two coast guard agencies.
     
            “It is not really intended to carry out traditional coast guard missions, but is primarily used as a central element in China’s paramilitary maritime force,” Powell said of “The Monster.”
     
            Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center, said CCG-5901’s size and crew enable it to be a central command ship for a larger operation.
     
            He noted that a Chinese navy aircraft carrier was also operating near the Philippines in recent weeks and that the combination of the two is a coordinated effort to demonstrate overwhelming Chinese naval power to Manila.
     
            China has both the world’s largest navy, in terms of sheer ship numbers, as well as the world’s largest coast guard.
     
            Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said “The Monster” shows the Chinese military’s ability for “escalation dominance,” adding that the vessel the Philippines had previously sent to Sabina Shoal, the Teresa Magbanua, was one of its best.
     
            The China Coast Guard “doesn’t want to be outdone thus this monster came along to show who’s got a bigger set of muscles,” Koh said.

            Five people were killed and nearly 100 injured when a tornado ripped through a town in eastern China, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.
     
            Dramatic video posted on social media showed the tornado ripping roofs off houses and uprooting trees as debris was thrown in the air.
     
            “Severe convective weather caused a tornado,” the Dongming County Emergency Management Bureau said, adding that the local government had established a command center and launched emergency response operations.
     
            According to Xinhua, 2,820 homes were damaged by the tornado in Caiyuan, Shandong province.
     
            Emergency services are currently conducting “post-disaster disposal and on site clean-up” the Bureau added.
     
            While tornadoes do not occur as frequently in China as they do in the US, they are not unknown. China averages fewer than 100 tornadoes per year, and at least 1,772 people died from tornadoes in the country in the 50 years since 1961, researchers say. 
 
            In April, a tornado struck the southern city of Guangzhou, killing at least five and injuring 33, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Earlier this month, the China Meteorological Administration released its annual ‘Blue Book’ on the state of climate change in the country. The report found that the country experienced its warmest year since 1901 and that “extreme weather and climate events tend to be more frequent and severe.”
     
            Other regions of the country are also grappling with extreme weather, as severe drought and record temperatures scorch the north while heavy rains inundate the south.

            For the first time ever, Tesla cars have been placed on a Chinese government purchase list, according to state-owned media outlet Paper.cn.
     
            Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China’s Geely, and state-owned SAIC.
     
            That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the cozy relationship China has with Elon Musk’s company.
     
            The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government.
     
            The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is “a domestic car, not imported,” according to a report by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee.
     Tesla CEO Elon Musk makes a surprise visit to China, it coincides with Beijing's auto show where reports suggest he is trying to export his company's self-driving technology. CNN's Marc Stewart has more.

            Tesla, which has a massive gigafactory in Shanghai, manufactured some 947,000 cars in China in 2023, and most of them were used locally.
     
            The Jiangsu government did not respond to CNN’s phone calls. On the government’s purchase catalog, Tesla’s Shanghai-made Model Y was listed at 249,900 yuan ($34,377).
     
            China has become an increasingly important market for Tesla, as the country accounts for more than half of the world’s total EV sales. Last year, Tesla derived nearly a quarter of its total revenue from China.
     
            But the US carmaker is also facing rising competition from Chinese rivals. BYD overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 as the biggest seller of EVs on the planet. Tesla regained its position in the first half of this year, but they are neck and neck.
     
            Tesla cars had previously been barred from entering some government and military complexes in China due to spying and data security concerns.
     
            Those restrictions were lifted in April, when a top auto association announced that Tesla’s cars had passed China’s data security requirements. The announcement came on the same day as Musk visited Beijing and met with Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a “successful model” for US-China collaboration.
     
            But, on most fronts, tensions between China and the West are increasing.

EU and China set for talks on planned electric vehicle tariffs
 
            The European Commission confirmed on Thursday that it would slap additional tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China.
     
            The tariffs, which were first announced in early June, are seen as a necessary move by the EU to deter a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with “unfair” support from the government.
     
            Tesla, a major exporter of China-made EVs to Europe, has requested a separate tariff rate calculation, according to the Commission. Currently, the company faces an average 20.8% additional tariff as part of a group of companies cooperating with the EU’s investigation.
     
            Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

            Germany has blocked the sale of a Volkswagen subsidiary to China on national security grounds, delivering a fresh blow to the already tense relationship with its biggest trading partner.
     
            MAN Energy Solutions, part of the Volkswagen Group, said in June 2023 that it planned to sell its gas turbines business to Chinese state-owned CSIC Longjiang GH Gas Turbine Co (GHGT). But a German government review, initiated in September, raised concerns that China might use the gas turbines to power warships, according to Reuters.
     
            The decision to block the deal comes just weeks after the European Union hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China, sparking a trade dispute with Beijing, which days later launched an investigation into prices of EU pork.
     
            During a press conference Wednesday, Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck said that Berlin welcomes investments from foreign companies, but technologies relevant to “public security” must be protected from countries “which maybe do not always have a friendly relationship with us.”
     
            At the same press conference, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said she welcomed the government’s decision “for security reasons.”
     
            Germany and China traded goods worth €255 billion ($275.3 billion) last year, according to German government figures. But Berlin’s relationship with Beijing has come under strain in recent years, as Germany tries to protect local manufacturers and reduce its dependence on China.

            It was burned badly by its close economic ties with Russia after the invasion of Ukraine — in particular a heavy reliance on Russian natural gas — and wants to reduce the risks of something similar happening in future.
     
            In November 2022, Germany blocked the sale of one of its semiconductor factories to a Chinese-owned tech company, also citing security concerns.
     
            A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that China opposes the “politicization” of “normal commercial cooperation.”
     
            “We hope that Germany will provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world, including Chinese companies.”
     
            MAN Energy Solutions said it respected the government’s decision. “(We) will now initiate a structured process to close-down the gas turbine division, which will take place over the coming months,” the company added in a statement shared with CNN.
     
            The additional EU tariffs, which could add as much as 38% to the cost of importing an electric car from China, will take effect from Friday for an initial period of four months. The EU must decide by November whether to adopt the tariffs for five years.
     
            In a statement Thursday, the European Commission said that “consultations with the Chinese government have intensified in recent weeks,” with a view to resolving the dispute.
     
            Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, reiterated earlier comments that the timing of the EU decision is “detrimental to the current weak demand” for EVs in Germany and the region.
     
            “The negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,” the company added in a statement.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday urged regional leaders to resist “external interference” at a gathering of a Eurasian security bloc touted by Beijing and Moscow as a counterbalance to Western power.
     
            Addressing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)’s annual leaders’ summit in Kazakhstan, Xi called on member states to “consolidate the power of unity” in the face of “the real challenge of interference and division.”
     
            “We should work together to resist external interference … and firmly grasp our own future and destiny, as well as regional peace and development, in our own hands,” Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            The 10-member bloc must handle internal differences with peace, seek common ground, and resolve difficulties in cooperation, Xi added.
     
            Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies.

A growing club led by Xi and Putin to counter the US is adding a staunchly pro-Russia member
 
            On Thursday, Belarus, a staunch Russian ally that helped Moscow launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, became the latest authoritarian state to join the SCO, after Iran became a full member last year. The bloc underwent its first expansion in 2017 to welcome India and Pakistan.
     
            Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was notably absent from this year’s event, further adding to the perception of the SCO’s anti-Western orientation.
     
            At the summit, Xi warned against what he called “the real threat of Cold War mentality” and called on member states to “uphold our security baseline.”
     
            He also urged countries to safeguard the right to development in the face of the “real risks of small yards with high fences,” referring to a strategy adopted by the US to restrict key technologies from China.
     
            The Chinese leader stressed the need to jointly promote scientific and technological innovation, and to maintain the stability and smoothness of industrial and supply chains.
     
            On the eve of the summit, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin – the two leaders driving the SCO’s expansion – met on the sidelines and hailed their countries’ deepening alignment.
     
            In opening remarks ahead of their bilateral meeting, Putin said Russia-China relations are going through “the best period in their history” and should be considered a “stabilizing” force for the world.
     
            “Russian-Chinese cooperation in global affairs serves as a main stabilizing factor on the international stage, and we continue to further enhance it,” Putin told Xi on Wednesday.
     
            The Russian president also underscored Moscow and Beijing’s roles “at the cradle” of the SCO’s founding and noted its rapid expansion in recent years.
     
            “As the number of participants grew … the SCO also gained a bigger role as one of the key pillars of a just multipolar world order,” Putin said.

            The meeting marks the two leaders’ second face-to-face talks in just two months following Putin’s visit to Beijing in May and comes shortly after the Russian president struck a landmark defense pact with North Korea.
     
            Much to the consternation of the US and Europe, China and Russia have deepened their political, economic and military ties since Putin and Xi declared a “no limits” partnership in February 2022 when the Russian leader visited Beijing, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
     
            China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia’s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its heavily sanctioned economy. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have also continued to hold joint military exercises, including with Iran.
     
            Meanwhile, the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation’s military industrial complex as it attacks Ukraine, which Beijing denies.
     
            In his opening remarks Wednesday, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should “keep upholding the original aspiration” of their “lasting friendship” in the face of “an international situation fraught with turbulence and changes.”
     
            Xi also hailed the “unique value” in China-Russia relations, urging the two countries to make new efforts to safeguard their “legitimate rights and interests” and “the basic norms governing international relations.”
     
            “China and Russia should continue to strengthen comprehensive strategic coordination, oppose external interference and jointly safeguard regional tranquility and stability,” Xi said, according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.

            Money is rushing into Chinese government bonds, sending their prices soaring and yields plunging to record lows as investors hunt for a safer alternative to the country’s ravaged real estate market and volatile stocks.
 
            The yield on China’s onshore 10-year government bond, which is a benchmark for a wide range of interest rates, touched 2.18% Monday, the lowest since 2002 when records began. Yields on 20-year and 30-year bonds are also hovering around historic lows. Bond yields, or the returns offered to investors for holding them, fall as prices rise.
     
            Lower borrowing costs should be welcome in an economy struggling to recover from a property crash, sluggish consumer spending and weak business confidence. But the sharp move in bonds is sparking talk of a bubble and triggering acute anxiety among China’s policymakers, who fear a crisis similar to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year.
     
            The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has issued over 10 separate warnings since April about the risk that a bond bubble could burst, destabilizing financial markets and derailing the Chinese economy’s uneven recovery. Now it’s doing something unprecedented —borrowing bonds to sell them to tamp down prices.
     
            “SVB in the United States has taught us that the central bank needs to observe and evaluate the situation of the financial market from a macro-prudential perspective,” PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a financial forum in Shanghai late last month.
     
            “At present, we must pay close attention to the maturity mismatch and interest rate risks associated with the large holdings of medium and long-term bonds by some non-bank entities,” the central bank governor added. Those entities include insurance companies, investment funds and other financial firms.
     
            SVB was the biggest US bank failure since the global financial crisis. The roots of its demise lay in the fact that SVB had ploughed billions into US government bonds, an apparently safe bet that came unstuck when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to tame inflation. Prices of the bonds SVB was holding fell, eroding its finances.
     
            Policymakers in China fear the risk of a similar crisis in the world’s second largest economy if the bond frenzy goes unchecked. Prices of Chinese bonds have risen fast since early this year as investors pile into them because of the uncertain economic outlook. Businesses are also borrowing less, leaving banks with excess cash they have to park somewhere.

China is trying to end its ‘epic’ property crisis. The hard work is just beginning
 
            “Credit demand is weak due to the property woes. As a result, banks have to buy more bonds as money is trapped in the interbank market,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group.
     
            A “deflationary outlook” for the economy has also taken hold among investors, prompting them to flock to long-term sovereign bonds, he added.
     
            Similar to SVB, China’s financial institutions have invested a significant amount in long-term government bonds, which make them vulnerable to sudden interest rate changes.
     
            Beijing is concerned that if the bond bubble pops, sending prices down and yields up, those lenders could suffer big losses.
     
            “What worries policymakers is the interest rate risk, which will rise once the dominant narrative shifts from deflation to reflation,” Hu from Macquarie said. 
 
            In the first half of this year, net purchases of sovereign bonds by financial institutions, mostly by regional banks, were 1.55 trillion yuan ($210 billion), up 61% from the same period last year, according to an analysis of central bank data by Zheshang Securities, a state-controlled brokerage firm.
     
            Official interest rates in China are low after cuts in recent years by the PBOC aimed at supporting the economy. Deflationary pressures have persisted — consumer prices rose less than expected in May and factory prices declined for the 20th month in a row.
     
            But “once external demand slows, Beijing will have to step up stimulus to achieve its (economic) growth target,” Hu said.
     
            If that happens, bond yields will rise as investors switch back into riskier stocks. Meanwhile, demand for credit should rise, banks will lend more and therefore reduce their holdings of government debt. This will cause the bond bull market to reverse, Hu said.
     
            The country’s “4,000 or so small and medium-sized banks” will be particularly vulnerable to the interest rate risk, he added.
     
            In a sign of growing concerns, the PBOC said Monday it would intervene directly in the bond market to cool the frenzy for “the first time in history,” according to state media.
     
            The central bank will borrow government bonds from traders on the open market, so that it can sell them in a bid to depress prices and boost yields.
     
            The decision was made after “careful observation and assessment” and was intended to “maintain the sound operation of the bond market,” the PBOC added.
     
            Chinese state media outlets are also sounding the alarm. The state-owned Securities Times warned Tuesday about the risks of a bond market bubble, calling out the case of SVB and a Japanese bank whose holdings of US and European government debt have lost value as yields have risen.
     
            “The bubble formed by the rush of funds into the bond market is accumulating interest rate risks,” the Securities Times said in an editorial. “The ‘triggers’ for the bankruptcy of SVB and the huge losses of Japan’s Norinchukin Bank were all interest rate risks caused by their over-reliance on bond investment.”
     
            The repeated verbal warnings have so far failed to rein in soaring bond prices. Hence this week’s market intervention.
     
            Monday’s move “demonstrates the PBOC’s determination” to cool the rally by selling bonds and lifting yields, said Zhang Jiqiang, chief fixed-income analyst at Huatai Securities.
     
            “The central bank wants to avoid an SVB-style crisis,” he said.
     
            The rapid decline in Chinese bond yields also poses significant risks to the economy.
     
            “Low government bond yields do more harm than good to the economy in the current circumstance,” said Ken Cheung, director of foreign exchange strategy at Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong.
     
            That’s because they could reinforce market expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the PBOC and weak growth, exacerbating the formation of “deflation mindset,” he said.
     
            In addition, the bond market frenzy may counteract the PBOC’s efforts to boost economic activity and increase money supply, as it encourages capital to flow into the bond market, rather than going to riskier assets such as stocks, property, and other investments that drive economic growth.
     
            The decline in Chinese government bond yields could also widen the interest rate spread between the US and China, causing money to flee the world’s second largest economy and heaping pressure on the yuan.
     
            “China’s capital outflows in April reached the highest level since Jan 2016, largely due to the widening US-China yield gap,” Hu said. “Therefore, the PBOC doesn’t want to see interest rates fall too quickly.”

            A club of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia to advance their leaders’ vision of an alternative world order is set to expand again this week – this time adding a staunch Russian ally that has openly supported Moscow’s war on Ukraine.
     
            The expected admission of Belarus to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at its annual leaders’ summit in Astana, Kazakhstan is another push by Beijing and Moscow to transform the grouping – from a regional security bloc into a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies.
     
            Belarus, which helped Russia to launch its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, will become the latest authoritarian state to join the club, after Iran became a full member last year.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have arrived in Astana for the summit that begins Wednesday, in what will be their second meeting this year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the world’s largest democracy, is skipping the event, pointing to unease among some members about the direction the SCO is headed.
     
            Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years in line with Beijing and Moscow’s shared ambition to counter what they see as US “hegemony” and reshape the international system in their favor.
     
            In 2017, the bloc underwent its first expansion to welcome India and Pakistan. After adding Belarus, it will boast 10 members, representing more than 40% of the world’s population and roughly a quarter of the global economy. It also has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and more than a dozen “dialogue partners” from Myanmar to Turkey and the Arab states.
     
            The SCO’s expansion comes after another bloc led by China and Russia, the BRICS group of major emerging economies, more than doubled its membership and significantly extended its global reach last year.
     
            As the SCO grows in international visibility and economic weight, it has also broadened in geopolitical ambitions.
     
            The expected admission of Belarus, which borders the European Union, “really highlights how the SCO’s mission has changed in the last few years,” said Eva Seiwert, an expert on China’s foreign policy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) in Berlin.
     
            “Unlike Iran, you don’t really get much like economic or security cooperation out of Belarus joining. And that’s why I argue that it’s more of a geopolitical move.”
     
            With Russia deep in the third year of its grinding war against Ukraine, the SCO has become a crucial diplomatic avenue for Putin, as well as a platform to showcase he’s not isolated internationally. And as China’s relations with the US have plummeted, Beijing is now less concerned about the SCO being branded an anti-Western organization – a perception that has only deepened following Iran’s admission, Seiwert said.
     
            “They want the SCO to be perceived as a major bloc that cannot be ignored anymore,” she said. “With all these countries joining, China and Russia (want to show they) both have a lot of supporters for their worldviews.”
     
            And in that shared worldview, there is no place for the US in Eurasia.
     
            In a meeting with his senior foreign ministry officials last month, Putin laid out a future vision for “a new system of bilateral and multilateral guarantees of collective security in Eurasia,” with the help of existing organizations like the SCO and a long-term goal to “gradually phase out the military presence of external powers in the Eurasian region.”
     
            “During my recent visit to China, President Xi Jinping and I discussed this issue. It was noted that the Russian proposal is not contradictory, but rather complements and aligns with the basic principles of the Chinese global security initiative,” said Putin, who visited Beijing in May.
     
            That big picture vison of an alternative future is going to be the “headline message” for China and Russia coming out of this SCO summit, said Bates Gill, a senior fellow for the National Bureau of Asian Research.
     
            But the Belarus membership also creates big question marks that will hang over the organization, Gill said.
     
            “It creates all sorts of problems and new questions about the reputation, legitimacy and mandate of the organization, given the nature of the Belarus regime and its support for Russia’s flagrant violation of international law and invasion of Ukraine,” he said.
     
            “Clearly the SCO can tolerate authoritarian regimes, but for the mandate of the organization, it further diversifies and dilutes its original focus, which was to be on Central Asia.”
     
            The bloc’s expansion hasn’t come without frictions – notably with the admission of bitter rivals India and Pakistan – while tensions between Beijing and New Delhi have also flared in recent years following deadly clashes on their disputed Himalayan border.
     
            The grouping’s increasingly anti-Western orientation following its embrace of Iran and now Belarus has also fueled unease among members that want to keep good relations with the West, including the former Soviet states in Central Asia.
     
            “In some respects, it puts the Central Asian states in a very awkward position,” Gill said. “They are pursuing what they like to call multi-trajectory diplomacy. They don’t want to be committed to only dealing with one major power, like Russia or China.”
     
            Gill, who visited Central Asia in April and May, said there was an ambivalence in regional capitals about the future of the SCO.
     
            India, too, appeared to be losing interest. Last year, it hosted the summit virtually – a muted arrangement that allowed Modi to avoid the optics of welcoming Putin and Xi to New Delhi as it sought closer ties with the US.
     
            This year, fresh from his third consecutive term inauguration, the Indian leader is skipping the summit in Astana – despite Russian state media reports that he will visit the Kremlin next week.
     
            “This tells us that he does not see the SCO as the most effective channel through which to pursue Indian interests in this part of the world,” Gill said.
     
            Even China, the main driver behind the SCO’s expansion, is seeking a more direct way to engage with Central Asia – without Russia’s involvement.

BRICS expansion is a big win for China. But can it really work as a counterweight to the West?
 
            Last year, five leaders from the region received a lavish welcome at the inaugural China-Central Asia summit in the Chinese city of Xi’an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked imperial China with civilizations to its west over a millennium ago. In March, a permanent Secretariat for the China-Central Asia mechanism was established in the same city.
     
            And while China and Russia aspire to present the SCO as a counterweight to US-led institutions, it remains a much weaker and less cohesive bloc compared with the likes of NATO, the European Union or the Group of Seven nations.
     
            “Given the expansion of membership with India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus, the organization will be even less like an alliance or committed common grouping, and more like a strategic-vision type of organization … representative of a Eurasian identity,” Gill said.
     
            After the summit in Astana, China is due to take up the rotating presidency of the SCO for a year.
     
            Seiwert, the expert at MERICS, said Beijing would work to find more common ground among member states.
     
            “For China, it’s important that the SCO doesn’t fail, that it is perceived as successful. I think they’re also aware of all the difficulties that have come with all these different expansions,” she said.
     
            “If it keeps on expanding – if Russia and China keep on pushing it to expand – then I think its regional relevance will really just diminish.”

            The government of China now possesses something that no other humans have ever encountered — rocks and soil from the far side of the moon.
     
            The successful return of the Chang’e-6 lunar mission with the historic cache on June 25 was a scientific coup that further solidified China’s place as one of the world’s top space powers, rivaled only by the United States.
     
            And despite competition heating up in the global race to establish a permanent human presence on the moon, China’s space agency is again following the precedent set by NASA decades ago after the Apollo missions  and sharing its lunar samples with scientists around the world.

            “China welcomes scientists from all countries to apply (to study the samples) and share in the benefits,” said Liu Yunfeng, director of the international cooperation office of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), during a Thursday news conference in Beijing.
     
            NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told CNN he’s “pleased to hear CNSA intends to share” the materials collected by the Chang’e-6 lunar probe last month. The samples, gathered using a drill and a mechanical arm, include up to 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms) of lunar dust and rocks from an ancient crater on the moon’s far side, which is never visible to Earth.
     
            “Make it available to the international community just as we will when we start bringing additional samples back, and as we did a half a century ago with the samples brought back from the six Apollo moon landings,” Nelson said.
     
            It’s a rare moment of consensus for two space agencies competing to land astronauts on the moon and build a base near the lunar south pole. But US access to the samples  may be stymied by a 2011 law known as the Wolf Amendment, which prohibits the use of government funds by NASA for bilateral cooperation with China or its agencies without authorization from Congress or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, effectively banning the space agency from routinely working with its Chinese counterpart.
     
            “The root cause of obstacles to China-US space cooperation lies in US domestic laws, such as the Wolf Amendment, which hinder cooperation between the two countries in space exploration,” said Bian Zhigang, vice chair of the China National Space Administration, during the Thursday news conference. “If the US truly wishes to engage in normal space exchanges with China, I think they should take concrete measures to remove these obstacles.”
     
            During the Cold War, NASA shared samples collected by Apollo astronauts from the moon’s near side with its rival in the first space race — the former Soviet Union — along with dozens of other countries, including China, according to a NASA spokeswoman. But samples from the moon’s far side have taken decades longer to procure. 
 
            China is the only country ever to make a soft landing of a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the moon, a feat that was first accomplished in 2019 by the country’s Chang’e-4 mission. A year later, China became only the third nation in history to successfully return samples from the side of the moon that faces Earth with the successful completion of the Chang’e-5 mission.

            China opened those samples to international scientists for the first time last August, and Nelson has given NASA-funded researchers the green light to apply for access.
     
            “We are going through the process right now with our scientists and our lawyers to make sure that the instructions and guardrails that the Chinese are insisting on … are not a violation of the law, the Wolf Amendment,” Nelson told CNN. “As of this moment, I don’t see a violation.”
     
            Any similar application to study the Chang’e-6 samples must pass the same vetting process, Nelson said. The US space agency “will continue to determine whether NASA-funded scientists and organizations can access the samples in accordance with Congressional restrictions on NASA interactions with CNSA.”
     
            China is now aiming to land astronauts on the moon “before 2030,” while the US is shooting for “the latter part of 2026,” according to Nelson. Despite the recent success of China’s robotic lunar missions, Nelson remains confident that the US is on track with NASA’s Artemis program to beat Beijing in this second space race to land people on the moon.
     
            “Spaceflight is hard, but human spaceflight is especially hard,” Nelson said. “And magnitudes more difficult than a robotic landing.”
     
            NASA currently has the edge in testing spacecraft capable of carrying humans to the moon. The uncrewed Artemis I mission successfully sent the Orion spacecraft around the moon in 2022, paving the way for the Artemis II mission to send four astronauts on the same trajectory as soon as September 2025. China has yet to fly a human-rated spacecraft around the moon.
     
            NASA has partnered with SpaceX to develop the lunar lander that will take astronauts from the Orion spacecraft to the surface of the moon during the Artemis III mission. That vehicle, dubbed Starship, successfully completed its fourth test flight in June but remains multiple test flights and technology demonstrations away from being capable of carrying people.
     
            China holds the advantage when it comes to the robotic exploration of the moon.  TheUS government has not landed a robotic spacecraft on the moon since 1968, but NASA is currently funding the development of lunar landers by private companies through its Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS program.
     
            Intuitive Machines’ IM-1 lander, also called Odysseus or “Odie,” became the first US-made spacecraft in more than five decades to soft land on the moon when it reached the lunar surface in February. But a different NASA-funded lunar lander named Peregrine, built by Astrobotic Technologies, failed just hours after lifting off on its maiden voyage in January due to a fuel leak.

            Factory activity among China’s private firms expanded at the fastest pace in three years, a private gauge showed Monday, suggesting healthier domestic and international demand for Chinese goods. 
 
            This contrasts with the results of an official government survey Sunday that showed a contraction among larger, state-owned manufacturers, underscoring that the recovery in the world’s second largest economy remains uneven.
     
            The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 51.8 in June, up from 51.7 in May, according to a statement from S&P Global, which compiled the survey. The numbers not only beat market expectations but also marked the sixth straight month of improvement in the index.
     
            But the gauge conflicted with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)’s PMI, which was unchanged from May at 49.5, marking a second consecutive month of contraction.
     
            The PMI is a monthly indicator of economic activity. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while anything below that level shows contraction.
     
            “The divergence” between the Caixin and the official PMIs has widened further from May and is likely because of differences in the sectors covered, said analysts from Goldman Sachs on Monday.
     
            The Caixin survey covers more export-oriented and consumer-related companies. The official PMI, however, is tilted more towards manufacturers that produce industrial materials — including steel, cement, and chemical — making them more vulnerable to a slowdown in fixed-asset investments.
     
            Analysts believe that the current data reflects an economic reality characterised by strong exports and consumption, but softer investment.
     
            “Demand for consumer and intermediate goods was stronger than that for investment goods,” said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
     
            “Overall, the manufacturing sector kept improving in June, with supply, domestic demand, and exports continuing to grow,” he added.

            Customs data for June are not available yet, but statistics for May showed that the country’s exports jumped 7.6% from a year earlier, beating analysts’ forecasts.
     
            Still, manufacturers are less optimistic about the outlook, as recent tariff announcements from the US and European Union have damped their sentiment.
     
            “The gauge for future output expectations … fell by more than three points from the previous month, marking the lowest since November 2019,” Wang said.
     
            “Concerns expressed by surveyed companies [in the Caixin index] were focused on prominent downward pressure on the economy and intense market competition,” he added.
     
            Last month, the EU announced additional tariffs of up to 38.1% on electric vehicles imported from China,because of what it sees as Beijing’s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers.
     
            The provisional tariffs are set to apply by July 4, while the investigation will continue. The duties will then be finalized on November 2 at the end of the probe.
     
            The EU’s decision came a month after the United States quadrupled tariffs on EVs from China, from 25% to 100%, a move aimed at boosting American jobs and manufacturing.

Dramatic downfall of two defense ministers raises questions,The downfall of two defense ministers over corruption allegations raises tough questions about the country’s combat readiness at a time of heightened tensions.,"Jul 1, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            After months of intense speculation and official reticence, China has finally confirmed its two former defense ministers who vanished from public view last year had been under investigation for corruption.
     
            Their dramatic downfall has exposed deep-rooted alleged deceit in key sectors of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s military modernization drive despite his decade-long war on graft, raising questions about the country’s combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.
     
            Li Shangfu, who was drastically ousted as defense minister in October after only seven months on the job, and Wei Fenghe, who served from 2018 to 2023, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party following the investigations, with both cases handed over to military prosecutors for charges, state media reported Thursday.
     
            The duo are the biggest heads to roll yet in a sweeping purge of China’s defense establishment since last summer, which has felled more than a dozen senior generals and executives from the military-industrial complex.
     
            The turmoil in the upper ranks of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) comes as leader Xi Jinping is seeking to make China’s armed forces stronger, more combat-ready and more aggressive in asserting its disputed territorial claims in the region.
     
            At the height of their careers, former defense ministers Li and Wei often struck a tough tone before the world’s top military officials. At successive regional security forums, the two generals warned the Chinese military would fight “at all costs” if anyone dares to “split” self-governing Taiwan from China. They also fired thinly veiled shots at the United States, vowing to push back against “hegemony” in the disputed South China Sea.
     
            Both promoted under Xi, their removals come despite the Chinese leader’s more than decade long signature anti-graft campaign, underscoring the difficulties in preventing corruption at the highest levels of the military, according to analysts.
     
            While Xi’s anti-corruption campaign has achieved some success, the lack of proper civilian oversight and an independent legal system means the PLA is reliant on its internal investigators for supervision, said James Char, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “That’s difficult, so corruption will definitely continue,” he said.
     
            As part of Xi’s ambition to transform the PLA into a “world class” fighting force, China has poured billions of dollars into buying and upgrading equipment. Xi has also built up the Rocket Force, an elite branch overseeing the country’s fast-expanding arsenal of nuclear and ballistic missiles.
     
            Most of the generals dismissed or disappeared without explanation last year were linked to the Rocket Force or military equipment, including Li and Wei.
     
            Before becoming Defense Minister, Li headed the PLA’s Equipment Development Department for five years. An engineer by training, the 66-year-old spent decades launching rockets and satellites in southwest China before being promoted to the PLA headquarters to deal with military equipment procurement.
     
            Wei, 70, was the inaugural commander of the Rocket Force. In late 2015, it was elevated by Xi into a full service from the PLA’s former missile arm, the Second Artillery Corps, where Wei had worked for decades. Wei’s two successors at the Rocket Force have also been purged.
     
            The allegations against Li laid out in the announcement by the party’s 24-member Politburo clearly point to corruption in the procurement of weapons.
     
            In addition to taking and giving bribes and abuse of power, Li was also accused of “severely polluting the political environment and industry practices of the military equipment sector,” according to state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            Joel Wuthnow, a senior research fellow at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University, said the carefully worded phrase points to collusion between the state-owned enterprises that manufacture weapons and the PLA procurement system.
     
            “We know there is some collusion, but it’s not clear – and the CCP would not admit it – that critical weapons actually are substandard or not reliable,” Wuthnow said. “If proven, that would be even more serious for Xi since he would have doubts not only about ethics but also about actual military readiness.”
     
            Char, the analyst, said problems in the PLA’s procurement system have existed for many years.
     
            In 2018, a study penned by China’s Naval University of Engineering, the Navy’s equipment procurement center and the audit office of the Central Military Commission had already analyzed the bid rigging practices in the PLA’s equipment procurement and called for improvement of the bidding system, Char noted.
     
            “These problems in procurement and acquisitions raised questions about the quality of the equipment that the PLA had purchased earlier. How well do they actually function on the field? I think that’s quite debatable,” he said.
     
            In a sign that China’s top military leadership could be concerned about the quality of its equipment, Gen. He Weidong, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which oversees the armed forces, vowed in March to crack down on “fake combat capabilities” within the military, Char noted.
     
            “His comment was quickly banned from public view afterwards. I think that says a lot about the actual combat capabilities of (the PLA),” Char said.
     
            Li and Wei are the most senior military figures to be felled in six years by Xi’s relentless anti-corruption campaign.
     
            The Chinese leader has made rooting out graft and disloyalty a hallmark of his rule since coming to power in 2012, and he has brought down powerful generals previously deemed untouchable.
     
            Within the first few years of his first term, Xi claimed his two most senior scalps in the military, Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, two former vice-chairmen of the CMC. Xu later died of cancer and Guo was sentenced to life in prison for corruption.
     
            In some ways, Wuthnow said, the latest corruption scandal around the two former defense ministers is “even worse for Xi” than the Xu and Guo cases a decade ago.
     
            “Back then we could say Xi was cleaning house,” he said, noting that Xu and Guo had been appointed to the CMC under former leader Jiang Zemin. But both Wei and Li were promoted under Xi.
     
            “Wei and Li’s cases show that Xi’s own vetting processes and vaunted anti-corruption campaign over the last decade haven’t succeeded at preventing graft at the top of the system,” Wuthnow said.
     
            “I think this shows once more that Xi has lost confidence in his own appointees.”

Xi’s latest purge targets the military. Why did powerful generals fall out of favor?
 
            Wei was promoted to the rank of general just over a week after Xi took the helm of the party. Li was promoted to lieutenant general and then again to general in just three years.
     
            The announcements by the Politburo said Li and Wei’s actions “betrayed the trust and responsibility” placed in them by the top leadership of the party and the military. Li “betrayed the party’s founding aspirations and party principles,” and Wei was accused of “collapse of faith and loss of loyalty,” according to CCTV.
     
            “Xi must be feeling personally betrayed by this high-level corruption,” wrote Bill Bishop, a China watcher and author of the Sinocism newsletter.
     
            But Xi remains determined to root out corruption and disloyalty. Last month, he convened the military top brass for a political-work conference in Yan’an, a sacred site of Chinese Communist revolution in party history, calling for a deepening of political rectification in the PLA.
     
            “The gun barrel must always be held in the hands of those who are loyal and reliable to the party,” Xi told the PLA elites. “Strictness is clearly required to…achieve combat effectiveness. There must be no place in the military for corrupt elements to hide.”
     
            Char, the PLA watcher in Singapore, said in the long run, Xi’s cleaning up of the military and its procurement system is a good sign for China’s combat capabilities.
     
            “The problems are being rectified as and when, and there will always be an ongoing review as to how Xi Jinping can actually bring the PLA up to speed to have his dream of modernizing the PLA by 2035 realized.”

            China on Thursday expelled its former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor from the ruling Communist Party over corruption allegations, state broadcaster CCTV reported, deepening a sweeping purge within the top ranks of the military.
     
            Li was removed in October last year without explanation after he vanished from public view for two months, amid a series of high-level shakeups that have roiled the world’s largest military.
     
            Li’s mysterious disappearance and drastic ouster just months into his job fueled intense speculation, coming after the surprise sacking of two top generals of the PLA Rocket Force, an elite unit overseeing the China’s nuclear and ballistic missiles, also without explanation.
     
            Thursday’s announcement is the first official confirmation from Chinese authorities that graft allegations are behind his dramatic disappearance.
     
            In a sign of the scale of the high-level purges, Li’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also expelled from the Communist Party Thursday over alleged corruption, according to CCTV.
     
            Both Li and Wei were former members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) – a powerful body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping who ultimately commands the armed forces.
     
            Li was placed under the military’s internal investigation over “serious violations of party discipline and law” on August 31 last year, according to CCTV, two days after he was last seen in public at a security forum in Beijing.

Xi’s latest purge targets the military. Why did powerful generals fall out of favor?
 
            The investigation by the CMC’s Commission for Discipline Inspection found Li had allegedly “seriously violated” political and organization disciplines, resisted investigation, sought “personnel benefits” for himself and others, and received “huge sums of money” in bribe as well as bribing others.
     
            “As a senior party and military leader, Li Shangfu betrayed his original mission and lost the principles of party spirit,” the CCTV report said, adding that his actions “betrayed the trust and responsibility placed in him” by the top leadership of the party and the military.
     
            His actions also “severely tainted the political and industry environment of the military equipment sector, caused significant damage to the party’s cause, the development of national defense and the military, and the image of senior leadership,” CCTV said.
     
            “The nature of his misconduct is extremely serious, the impact is exceedingly harmful, and the consequences are particularly severe.”
     
            Wei, Li’s predecessor as defense minister from 2018 to 2023, was also accused of serious violations of political and organization disciplines, resisting investigation, taking bribes, as well as “collapse of faith and loss of loyalty,” according to CCTV.
     
            Both Li and Wei’s cases have been handed to the military procuratorate for prosecution, CCTV said, adding that the two generals had been stripped of their military ranks.
     
            The allegations laid out in the CCTV reports appear to point to corruption in the procurement and development of China’s military equipment, with a likely focus on the Rocket Force – which has been a key element in Xi’s efforts to “modernize” the PLA and transform it into a “world class” fighting force.
     
            Before becoming Defense Minister, Li headed the PLA’s Equipment Development Department for five years, while Wei was the inaugural commander of the Rocket Force when it was revamped at the end of 2015.
     
            Since last summer, more than a dozen high-level military officers and aerospace executives in the military-industrial complex have been stripped of their public roles.
     
            Xi has made rooting out corruption and disloyalty a hallmark of his rule since coming to power in 2012, and the purges suggest that campaign is far from over within the military.

            Two employees have left Adidas as a result of an ongoing investigation by the German sportswear brand into allegations of corruption in China.
     
            Adidas said last week that it was investigating “compliance violations” in China, a key market for its sportswear, after Chinese state media reported that the company’s executives in the country had been accused of embezzling millions of euros and taking huge kickbacks.
     
            “While Adidas is investigating this matter together with independent external advisers, evidence has been found that in the interaction with local vendors, one employee violated the company’s code of conduct,” Claudia Lange, head of media relations at the apparel giant, said in a statement Wednesday.
     
            “Separately, a second employee failed to meet the company’s leadership expectations of demonstrating mutual respect and trust,” she said, adding that both had left the company and that the investigation continues.
     
            Chinese state media outlet Economic View reported Wednesday that both former employees had worked in marketing for Adidas China.
     
            The allegations against Adidas executives were contained in an unsigned letter from people calling themselves employees of Adidas China. The letter was widely publicized online earlier this month and reported by state media outlet Jiemian.
     
            Jiemian wrote that the letter had been sent directly to the company’s German headquarters before being shared on social media.
     
            Lange told CNN last week that Adidas had received an anonymous letter on June 7 “indicating potential compliance violations in China.”
     
            The reported complaint alleged that a senior executive in Greater China who manages Adidas’s marketing budget had embezzled millions of euros and taken kickbacks from external advertising and celebrity agencies. Several members of the executive’s team and other employees were also implicated, according to a copy of the letter published by the Chinese state media outlet.
     
            Adidas Greater China’s overall promotional budget amounted to €250 million ($268 million) a year, including expenses for marketing, branding, and trade fairs, Jiemian reported, citing the letter.
     
            The senior manager was also accused of “nepotism” and “workplace bullying,” including isolating some employees and forcing them to leave, the letter’s authors reportedly said.
     
            The complaint also claimed that one of the manager’s subordinates had received “millions … from suppliers and physical items such as real estate.”
     
            Adidas is the world’s second-largest sportswear retailer. Greater China — a region that encompasses mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — accounts for 15% of the company’s sales.
     
            In mainland China, Adidas is the second-largest international sportswear brand behind Nike (NKE). The German company has enjoyed a rebound in sales growth in China since Beijing scrapped Covid restrictions at the end of 2022.
     
            Adidas is well-known for playing the “celebrity” card in its marketing in China. It has previously worked with popular actors and singers as brand ambassadors, including Yang Mi, Dilraba and Yi Yangqianxi.

            China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of President Lai Ching-te who took office last month, saying he is a “separatist,” and staged war games shortly after his inauguration.
     
            China on Friday threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for “diehard” Taiwan independence separatists, a ratcheting up of pressure even though Chinese courts have no jurisdiction on the democratically governed island.
     
            Taiwan has complained of a pattern of ramped up Chinese pressure since Lai won the election in January, including ongoing military actions, trade sanctions and coast guard patrols around Taiwan-controlled islands next to China.
     
            The new guidelines say China’s courts, prosecutors, public and state security bodies should “severely punish Taiwan independence diehards for splitting the country and inciting secession crimes in accordance with the law, and resolutely defend national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,” according to China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.
     
            The guidelines are being issued in accordance with laws already on the books, including the 2005 anti-secession law, Xinhua said.
     
            That law gives China the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or seems about to.
     
            Sun Ping, an official from China’s Ministry of Public Security, told reporters in Beijing the maximum penalty for the “crime of secession” was the death penalty.
     
            “The sharp sword of legal action will always hang high,” she said.
     
            There was no immediate response from Taiwan’s government. One official told Reuters they were still digesting the contents of the new guidelines.
     
            The guidelines detail what is considered a crime worthy of punishment, including promoting Taiwan’s entry to international organizations where statehood is a condition, having “external official exchanges” and “suppressing” parties, groups and people that promote “reunification.”
     
            The guidelines add a further clause to what could be considered a crime – “other acts that seek to separate Taiwan from China” – meaning the rules can be broadly interpreted.
     
            Lai has repeatedly offered to hold talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.
     
            China has taken legal measures against Taiwanese officials before, including imposing sanctions on Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s former de facto ambassador to the United States and now the island’s vice president.
     
            Such punishments have little practical effect as Chinese courts do not have jurisdiction in Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims.
     
            Senior Taiwanese officials, including its president, also do not visit China.

            At 7-foot-3, China’s teenage basketball star Zhang Ziyu looks to have an exciting career ahead of her.
     
            Playing in her first international tournament this week, the 17-year-old has already created headlines after dominating at the FIBA Under-18 Women’s Asia Cup, helping China remain unbeaten in its first two games.
     
            On Monday, Zhang came off the bench for her international debut and scored 19 points on 9-for-9 shooting in just 13 minutes, helping China brush aside Indonesia 109-50. She also racked up seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks.
     
            The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) subsequently released a video of her game highlights, showing the youngster towering over opponents and barely needing to jump to dunk the ball.
     
            Given her height advantage, she looked devastating in defense while demonstrating her shooting accuracy from distance. The footage has since gone viral on social media.
     
            “Zhang Ziyu is a cheat code,” a social media user said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
     
            After Monday’s breakthrough game, Zhang is showing no signs of slowing down.
     
            Earlier on Tuesday, the center totaled 36 points on 80% shooting along with 13 rebounds and four blocks as she inspired China past New Zealand 90-68 to maintain its perfect start to the tournament.
     
            China next plays on Wednesday against Japan, with the teenager set to star once again.
     
FIBA lists Zhang as 7-foot-3 on its official website, meaning she is only one inch shorter than San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama.
     
            Given her height and nationality, social media users have already compared her to NBA legend Yao Ming, who was just three inches taller.
     
            While Zhang has a long way to go before matching Yao’s career, her performances this week will surely pique the interest of teams across the WNBA.

            Chinese Premier Li Qiang has warned against a “vicious cycle” of economic decoupling from the West, as Beijing struggles to contain rising global pushback over soaring electric vehicle (EV) exports.
     
            Speaking to international executives at the “Summer Davos” forum in the northeastern city of Dalian on Tuesday, Li also defended his country against accusations that Chinese overcapacity in key green industries has led to dumping of products such as EVs and solar panels on global markets.
     
            “If countries only consider maximizing their own interests, if we ignore the interests of others, and even go back in history and engage in decoupling … it will only raise the economic operating costs of the entire society and the world,” he said.
     
            This will “drag countries … into a vicious cycle of scrambling for a cake that becomes smaller and smaller,” Li added. “This is something that we don’t want to see.”
     
            The remarks by China’s second most powerful leader after Xi Jinping come a day after Canada became the latest Western country to consider imposing tariffs on EVs made in China. The Canadian government said on Monday that its workers faced “unfair competition” from Beijing’s “state-directed policy of overcapacity.” It will begin a 30-day public consultation period next month to assess possible responses.
     
            Last month, the Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on EV imports from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to protect American jobs and manufacturing. Chinese EV sales to the United States are tiny.
     
            However, the challenges facing China’s EV makers grew when a much larger market followed suit weeks later. The European Union (EU), the biggest overseas buyer of Chinese EVs, announced additional provisional tariffs earlier this month because of what it called Beijing’s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers.
     
            The two sides have agreed to start talks to negotiate on a possible compromise before the duties come into full effect in November, according to Reuters.
     
            The best outcome would be for the EU to scrap its decision altogether before July 4, when the tariffs begin to kick in, outspoken Chinese state media outlet Global Times reported on Sunday.
     
            China’s growing trade woes come against the backdrop of a sluggish economy, weighed down by its all-important real estate sector, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity.
     
            But Li struck an upbeat tone at the gathering of global executives. He took the opportunity to pitch China as a place to do business, saying it was a “large open market.” The premier said the economy had shown “promising signs of recovery” early in the year, with “strong” growth of 5.3% in the first quarter.
     
            “This positive momentum is expected to continue through the second quarter, and we have both the confidence and the capacity to achieve our annual economic growth target of approximately 5%,” he said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/china/china-change-6-moon-mission-return-scn-intl-hnk/index.html,China’s Chang’e-6 moon mission returns to Earth with historic far side samples,"China’s Chang’e-6 lunar module returned to Earth Tuesday, completing its historic mission to collect the first ever samples from the far side of the moon in a major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program.","Jun 25, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
China’s Chang’e-6 lunar module returned to Earth Tuesday, successfully completing its historic mission to collect the first ever samples from the far side of the moon in a major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program.
     
            The reentry module “successfully landed” in a designated zone in China’s northern Inner Mongolia region just after 2 p.m. local time, according to state broadcaster CCTV. A livestream carried by CCTV showed the module touching down via parachute to a round of applause in the mission control room.
     
            “The Chang’e-6 lunar exploration mission has been a complete success,” said Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), from the control room.
     
            A search team located the module minutes after its landing, according to CCTV. The livestream showed a worker carrying out checks on the module, which lay on grassland beside a Chinese flag.
     
            The successful mission is a key milestone in China’s “eternal dream” – as articulated by Chinese leader Xi Jinping – to establish the country as a dominant space power and comes as a number of countries, including the United States, also ramp up their own lunar exploration programs.
     
            In a congratulatory message Tuesday, Xi hailed the mission as “another landmark achievement in building a strong country in space, and science and technology.”
     
            Beijing plans to send astronauts to the moon by 2030 and build a research base at the lunar south pole – a region believed to contain water ice, where the US also hopes to establish a base.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe is expected to have returned to Earth with up to 2 kilograms of moon dust and rocks from the lunar far side, which will be analyzed by researchers in China before being opened for access by international scientists, according to the CNSA.
     
            Results from the analysis of the samples could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon, the Earth and the solar system – while also aiding China’s aim to utilize resources on the moon to further its exploration there, experts say.
     
            The samples were collected using a drill and robotic arm from a location within the sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, an impact crater formed some 4 billion years ago on the moon’s far side, which is never visible to Earth.
     
            An ascender then lifted them off the lunar surface and transferred them in lunar orbit to a re-entry vehicle, which then traveled back to Earth after separating from its lunar orbiter.
     
            The progress of Chang’e-6 – China’s most technically complex mission to date – has been followed with intense interest within the country since its launch on May 3.
     
            Earlier this month, images of the lunar lander displaying the Chinese flag and appearing to have drilled the character “zhong” – shorthand for China – on the lunar surface went viral on Chinese social media.
     
            The return of the lunar module Tuesday also comes after suspected debris from a separate Chinese rocket was seen plummeting to the ground in southwest China on Saturday, leaving a trail of bright yellow smoke and sending villagers running, according to videos on Chinese social media and sent to CNN by a local witness.
     
            The far side of the moon has been a point of fascination for scientists since they first peered at it in grainy, black and white images captured by the Soviet Union’s Luna 3 spacecraft in 1959 – and realized how different it was from the side facing Earth.
     
            Absent were the lunar maria, or large, dark plains of cooled lava that pockmark much of the moon’s near side. Instead, the far side appeared to show a record of impact — covered in craters of different sizes and ages.
     
            Decades later, and some five years since the Chang’e-4 mission made China the first and only country to complete a soft landing on the far side, scientists both from China and around the world have high hopes for the information that can be gleaned from the samples.

China’s Chang’e-6 probe lifts off with samples from moon’s far side in historic first
 
            “It’s a gold mine …  a treasure chest,” said James Head, a professor of planetary geosciences at Brown University, who together with European scientists, collaborated with Chinese scientists analyzing samples from the Chang’e-5 mission that returned near-side samples. “International scientists are totally excited about the mission,” he said.
     
            Head pointed to the destruction of many clues of evolutionary history due to the shifting of the Earth’s plate tectonics and erosion that has obscured the planet’s first several billion years, including the period when life emerged.
     
            “The moon is really the cornerstone for understanding that because its surface does not have plate tectonics – it’s actually a frozen record of what it was like in our early solar system,” he said, adding that understanding the moon’s makeup can not only aid our understanding of the past but future exploration of the solar system.
     
            While the stated focus of the Chang’e-6 mission is these broader scientific questions, experts say analysis of the composition and physical properties of the samples could also help advance efforts to learn how to use resources on the moon for future lunar and space exploration.

            “The (Chang’e-6) mission is focused on answering specific scientific questions, but the lunar soils collected from the mission can support future resource utilization,” said Yuqi Qian, a planetary geologist at the University of Hong Kong.
     
            Lunar soil could be used for 3-D printing to produce bricks for construction of research bases on the moon, while some scientists were already working on finding more economical and practical technologies to extract gases like Helium-3, oxygen and hydrogen from the soil, which could support further lunar exploration, he said.
     
            Once they receive the samples, Chinese scientists are expected to share data and carry out joint research with international partners, before Beijing later opens the samples for access by international teams, according to statements from CNSA officials.
     
            International teams had to wait roughly three years to apply for access to samples from the Chang’e-5 mission, but some of the earliest published research on those samples was from teams of Chinese and international scientists.
     
            Chang’e-6 – the sixth of eight scheduled missions in the Chang’e series – is widely seen as an important step forward for China’s aim to put astronauts on the moon in the coming years.
     
            “Each step in the sample return mission process is exactly what you need to do to land humans on the moon and return,” Head said. “It shouldn’t be lost on anyone that while, on one hand, this is a scientific mission, the command and control aspects (are) exactly what you need for lunar human exploration as well as things like Mars sample return.”
     
            China’s ambitions to send astronauts to the moon come as the US targets launching a crewed “Artemis” mission as early as 2026 – in what would be America’s first such attempt in more than 50 years.
     
            NASA chief Bill Nelson has appeared to point to China’s pace as a driver in US progress, telling lawmakers in April that the two countries were “in effect … in a race.”
     
            “My concern is that they (get to the south pole) first and then say, ‘this is our area, you stay out,’ because the south pole of the moon is an important part … We think that there is water there and if there’s water, then there’s rocket fuel,” Nelson said.

            China has sought to dispel concerns about its ambitions, reiterating its position that space exploration should “benefit all mankind” and actively recruiting country partners for its planned international lunar research station.
     
            China and the US are not alone in eyeing the national prestige, potential scientific benefits, access to resources and further deep space exploration that successful moon missions could bring.
     
            Last year, India landed its first spacecraft on the moon, while Russia’s first lunar mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon’s surface.
     
            In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the lunar south pole.
     
            China is scheduled to launch its Chang’e-7 mission to the lunar south pole region in 2026, while Chang’e-8 will be launched in 2028 to carry out tests aimed at utilization of lunar resources in preparation for the lunar research station, Chinese space authorities said earlier this year.

            Suspected debris from a Chinese rocket was seen plummeting to the ground over a village in southwest China on Saturday, leaving a trail of bright yellow smoke and sending villagers running, according to videos on Chinese social media and sent to CNN by a local witness.
     
            The dramatic footage surfaced online shortly after a Long March 2C carrier rocket blasted off at 3p.m. local time Saturday (3 a.m. Eastern Time) from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
     
            The rocket sent into orbit the Space Variable Objects Monitor, a powerful satellite developed by China and France to study the farthest explosion of stars known as gamma-ray bursts.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to establish the country as a dominant space power, ramping up missions to compete with other major world powers, including the United States.
     
            Saturday’s launch was declared a “complete success” by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), a state-owned contractor that developed the Long March 2C rocket.
     
            CNN has reached out to the CASC and the State Council Information Office, which handles press inquiries for the Chinese government, including its space agency, for comment.
     
            A video posted on Kuaishou, a Chinese short-video site, appeared to show a long, cylindrical shaped piece of debris falling over a rural village and crashed next to a hill, with yellow smoke billowing from one end.
     
            CNN geolocated the video to be filmed from Xianqiao village in Guizhou province, neighboring the launch site province of Sichuan to the southeast. The video was posted on Kuaishou from an IP address in Guizhou.
     
            Other videos circulating on Chinese social media platforms analyzed by CNN showed multiple angles of the falling debris. In one of them, villagers, including children, were seen running away while looking back at the orange trail in the sky, with some covering their ears for the crash.
     
            Some videos had been taken down by Monday afternoon.
     
            Witnesses on social media said they heard a loud explosion after the debris crashed into the ground. An eyewitness told CNN they saw the rocket fall with their “own eyes.” “There was a pungent smell and the sound of an explosion,” they added.
     
            In a now-deleted government notice reposted by a local villager shortly after the launch, authorities said that Xinba Town, near Xianqiao village, was going to carry out a “rocket debris recovery mission” from 2:45 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. local time on Saturday.
     
            Residents were asked to leave their homes and other buildings an hour before the launch and scatter out in more open areas to observe the sky. They were warned to keep away from the debris to prevent harm from “toxic gas and explosion,” according to the notice.
     
            Residents were also “strictly forbidden” to take photos of the debris or “spread relevant videos online,” the notice said.
     
            There were no reports of immediate injuries from local authorities.
     
            Markus Schiller, a rocket expert and associate senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the debris appeared to be the first-stage booster of the Long March 2C rocket, which uses a liquid propellant consisting of nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH).
     
            “This combination always creates these orange smoke trails. It’s extremely toxic and carcinogenic,” Schiller said. “Every living being that inhales that stuff will have a hard time in the near future,” he added.
     
            Such incidents happen frequently in China due to the location of its launch site, he said.

            “If you want to launch something to low Earth orbit, you usually launch it in the easternly direction to get some extra boost from the rotation of the Earth. But if you launch to the east, there are definitely always some villages in the pathway of the boosters of the first stage.”
     
            Most rockets in China are blasted from the country’s three inland launch sites – Xichang in the southwest, Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert in the northwest, and Taiyuan in the north. Built during the Cold War, these bases were deliberately located far from the coast out of security concerns.
     
            In 2016, a fourth launch site, Wenchang, opened in Hainan Island, the country’s southernmost province.
     
            In comparison, NASA and the European Space Agency usually launch their rockets from coastal locations toward the ocean, said Schiller, who’s also a director of ST Analytics in Munich, Germany.
     
            Western space agencies have also largely phased out the kind of highly toxic liquid propellants for their civilian space programs, which China – and Russia – still use, he added.

            Multi-staged rockets shed debris shortly after blast-off, along trajectories that can be predicted before the launch.
     
            Before each launch, China’s civil aviation authority typically issues a notice to pilots, known as NOTAM, to warn them against the “temporary danger areas” where rocket debris are likely to be falling.
     
            Debris from Chinese rockets have hit villages before. In December 2023, the debris of a rocket landed in southern Hunan Province, damaging two houses, state media reported. In 2002, a boy in northern China was injured when fragments from a satellite launch fell on his village in Shaanxi province.
     
            “I expect that we’ll see something like that for quite a while, for many years to come,” Schiller said.
     
            China has previously faced criticism from the international space community for its handling of debris from its out-of-control rocket boosters when they reenter Earth.
     
            In 2021, NASA lambasted China for its failure to “meet responsible standards” after debris from its out-of-control Long March 5B rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean just west of the Maldives after reentering the atmosphere.

            Huawei is in the midst of one of the most stunning comebacks in the history of the tech industry.
     
            The Chinese giant, which has been a flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing, says more than 900 million smartphones now use its in-house operating system Harmony OS.
     
            “We have done in 10 years what our European and American counterparts have done in more than 30 years, and have achieved independent control of the core technology of the operating system,” Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei’s consumer business group, said at a developer forum on Friday.
     
            Harmony, which is called “Hongmeng” in Chinese, was first unveiled in 2019, months after Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from selling tech and software to the Chinese tech company without a license.
     
            US policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company’s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn’t stop some American allies — such as the UK — limiting Huawei’s role in building 5G networks.
     
            The US ban prevented companies like Google (GOOGL) from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm’s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become “a brick.”
     
            Now the company is once again making its way back to the top. It’s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla’s Model S. And it has big ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI).
     
Nvidia (NVDA), which is running neck and neck with Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable public company in the world, earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the production of processors that power AI systems.
     
            Yu said Friday that Huawei’s own AI framework, composed of its Ascend processors, was 1.1 times more effective in training large language models than mainstream international offerings. He did not name the competitors.
     
            But it’s in smartphones that the revival is so far most obvious. Sales of Huawei’s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu added, underscoring the company’s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions.
     
            The Shenzhen-based conglomerate’s popular Mate 60 Pro smartphone made headlines last year when the US government sought more information about the model, which included a sophisticated processor.
     
            Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could acquire such  chips following sweeping efforts by the US to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of national security concerns.

            The company’s net profit soared 564% to $2.71 billion in the first quarter, and that robust jump comes after it recorded its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023, thanks to a pick-up in its consumer segment and income from new businesses like smart car components.
     
            Huawei is also going after another of the biggest companies in the world. The success of its smartphones in China have directly impacted Apple (AAPL) in the premium segment, according to data from Counterpoint Research in April.
     
            The iPhone maker, which led China’s smartphone market with a near 20% share in the first quarter of 2023, fell to third spot in the first three months of this year, according to Counterpoint. Its market share stood at 15.7%, while Huawei’s jumped to 15.5%, from 9.3% in 2023.
     
            Sales of the iPhone began bouncing back in May, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market.

            As Russian President Vladimir Putin glided through the crowd-lined streets of Pyongyang atop a luxury Mercedes-Benz alongside his North Korean host Kim Jong Un last week, the two autocrats’ most important partner was watching from the sidelines hundreds of miles away in Beijing.
     
            Five years ago, Xi Jinping was offered the same open-top ride with Kim when he became the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. At the time, the two leaders vowed to strengthen ties and deepen cooperation, but the language paled in comparison with the “breakthrough” new partnership struck by Kim and Putin.
     
            In a wide-ranging treaty spanning political, trade, investment, and security cooperation, North Korea and Russia pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
     
            Putin said Russia and North Korea have ramped up ties to a “new level.” Kim, meanwhile, called the new “alliance” a “watershed moment” in bilateral relations.
     
            The new landmark defense pact agreed by the two nuclear-armed regimes rattled the United States and its Asian allies. Japan voiced “grave concerns” about Putin’s vow not to rule out cooperation with Pyongyang on military technology. South Korea responded by convening an emergency national security meeting and said it would now consider sending arms to Ukraine.
     
            In contrast, the reaction from China, the main political and economic patron for both Russia and North Korea, has been all but muted.
     
            A spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the treaty, calling it a bilateral matter between Russia and North Korea.
     
            Beneath the official reticence, however, China is likely watching warily, analysts say.
     
            The deepening ties between two wayward autocrats risk creating new uncertainty for Xi, who needs peace and stability in Northeast Asia as he grapples with a raft of domestic challenges, especially the slowing economy.
     
            Beijing is worried that Moscow’s assistance to Pyongyang – especially on military technology – would further enable and embolden the erratic Kim regime, which has drastically accelerated the buildup of nuclear weapons and missile programs, said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong.
     
            “When it comes to the North Korea issue, China aims to control the situation and prevent escalation, but it also does not want North Korea to completely collapse either” – a scenario that Beijing fears would allow the US to extend its control right to its doorstep, Liu said.
     
            Previously, Russia had been largely aligned with China on the issue, but its desperate need for North Korea to support its grinding war in Ukraine risks undermining the delicate balance.
     
            Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers – the equivalent of 260,000 metric tons of munitions or munitions-related material – from North Korea since September, according to a US statement in February. Both Russia and North Korea have rejected the claim.
     
            And while the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation’s military industrial complex, Beijing has refrained from offering direct military assistance to Putin and has steered clear of supporting Kim’s nuclear and missile programs.
     
            “If Putin provides more support to North Korea on nuclear issues, including some technical assistance, it will become more difficult for China to control the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” Liu said.
     
            The mutual defense pact signed by Kim and Putin harks back to a 1961 treaty between North Korea and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. That deal was replaced with one that offered much weaker security assurances after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
     
            But North Korea’s mutual defense treaty with China, also signed in 1961, remains in place after multiple renewals.
     
            The Sino-North Korea Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is the only formal military alliance treaty China has signed with another country, though Beijing doesn’t admit it as such and remains deliberately vague about whether China is obliged to automatically come to North Korea’s defense when a war breaks out.
     
            Similarly, it remains unclear what Russia and North Korea are willing – and able – to do for one another under the new defense pact.
     
            The new treaty comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim has ramped up fiery rhetoric and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. After the end of the Korean War in 1953, a formal peace treaty was never signed between the two Koreas, leaving them technically in a state of war.
     
            But the political message of the pact is loud and clear. Driven by a shared hostility to the US and its allies, the two autocratic nations are seeking to undermine and create an alternative to the Western-led global order – a goal shared by China.
     
            Speaking after his meeting with Kim, Putin rankled against what he called “the imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites.”
     
            A month ago, Putin and Xi delivered a similar swipe at the US during the Russian leader’s visit to Beijing. In a sweeping joint statement, the two “old friends” took aim at what they described as a global security system defined by US-backed military alliances – and pledged to work together to counter it.
     
            Western observers have warned against a loose but growing coordination of interests among China, Russia, North Korea and Iran – something one senior US military commander recently likened to a new “axis of evil.”
     
            As Moscow and Pyongyang deepen their alliance, Beijing would be cautious to keep a distance, Liu said, adding that “China certainly doesn’t want to be seen as part of a new Axis.”
     
            But despite the absence of Xi, China would have been the elephant in the room throughout Putin and Kim’s meeting.
     
            “Any such meeting will also include discussion of China,” said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.
     
            “Russia will know full well that China does not want to be left out of any substantial negotiations involving North Korea, not least since China is far more important – compared to Russia – to North Korea.”
     
            Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China doesn’t feel it can control the pace and extent of the deepening engagement between Russia and North Korea.
     
            “But they do know that China plays an irreplaceable role for both Russia and North Korea,” she said.
     
            China remains the largest trade partner to both Russia and North Korea, providing a crucial lifeline to the heavily sanctioned economies. Beijing also lends significant political support and diplomatic cover to the two international pariahs.
     
            “China doesn’t think that an alliance between Russia and North Korea would be a betrayal,” said Liu with the City University of Hong Kong.
     
            “Neither of the two countries has the capacity to betray China. They still need to rely on China despite their alliance.”

            Tens of thousands of people across southern China have been evacuated, with many more potentially at risk, as deadly torrential rains continue to lash the region, causing flash flooding and mudslides.
     
            At least 55 people have died since June 9, Chinese state media reported Friday, with dramatic footage showing urban areas submerged in water and buildings appearing to subside as emergency responders in speedboats raced to rescue stranded residents.
     
            Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday that at least 47 people have died in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province, among the hardest hit places amid reports of record flooding along the banks of the Songyuan and Shiku rivers.
     
            The southern Guangdong province is an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people and is subject to annual flooding from April to September. But the region has faced more intense rainstorms and severe flooding in recent years as scientists warn the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent.
     
            Earlier in the week, more than 10,000 people were evacuated from Meizhou, and as many as 130,00 were left without power, with authorities in the city raising the flood control emergency response to Level-I, according to state media. China’s flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe.
     
            Of those, 38 were reported dead in the city’s Pingyuan county and two people were reported missing, CCTV reported, adding that over 55,000 people have been affected by the heavy rainfall and the direct economic loss is estimated to be about 5.8 billion yuan ($799 million).
     
            In the nearby southern province of Fujian, state media reported at least eight people had died, including four in Wuping county and the rest in Shanghang county, adding that heavy rainfall has affected an estimated 586,500 people across 40 counties.
     
            And in Guangxi, a neighboring southern region to the west, state media reported 48 rivers were running above flood alert levels, forcing authorities to introduce a Level-II emergency response.
     
            The Lijiang River, a famous and popular tourist destination that runs through Guilin, saw its worst flooding since 1998, resulting in more than 6,000 people being evacuated, state media reported on Thursday.
     
            The emergency response to the flooding comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property, as China grapples with extreme weather with heavy rains in the south and severe drought and record temperatures in the north.
     
            Other parts of China are also facing earlier and longer extreme heat periods and droughts each year, causing widespread power shortages and disruptions on food and industrial supply chains.

China’s military could isolate Taiwan, cripple its economy, and make the democratic island succumb to the will of Beijing’s ruling Communist Party without ever firing a shot, a prominent think tank warns.
     
            Fears the Communist Party might make good on its promise to one day take control of Taiwan, by force if necessary, have been heightened in recent years by Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s increasingly bellicose actions towards the self-ruled island.
     
            China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only added to those fears.
     
            In such a scenario, analysts and military strategists have long focused on two key options available to China – a full-scale invasion or a military blockade.
     
            But a Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), warns there is a third way, one that will make it far harder for the United States and other like-minded democracies to counter: Quarantine.
     
            Using “gray zone” tactics – actions just below what might be considered acts of war – the China Coast Guard, its so-called maritime militia and various police and maritime safety agencies could initiate a full or partial quarantine of Taiwan, possibly cutting off access to its ports and stopping vital supplies like energy from reaching the island’s 23 million people, a newly released report from CSIS says.
     
            The naval, air and ground components of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the world’s largest military force, might play only auxiliary and support roles, authors Bonny Lin, Brian Hart, Matthew Funaiole, Samantha Lu and Truly Tinsley write.
     
            “China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years, stoking fears that tensions could erupt into outright conflict. Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan,” the report says.
     
            At the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore earlier this month, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun warned those who support any moves for Taiwan independence will “end up in self-destruction.”
     
            “We will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds,” said Dong, speaking through a translator, while slamming “external interfering forces” for selling arms and having “illegal official contacts” with Taiwan.
     
            China’s escalating gray zone tactics were on stark display this week as China Coast Guard vessels clashed with Philippine Navy boats in the South China Sea.
     
            Videos showed Beijing’s troops threatening Filipinos with an axe and other bladed weapons, and Manila said one of its soldiers lost a thumb in a Chinese-instigated collision.
     
            The level of violence was a major step up from previous clashes near Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippines maintains an outpost on a beached warship in waters claimed by both Beijing and Manila.
     
            Similarly, Beijing’s military and economic intimidation of Taiwan, a highly developed free-market economy, has grown much more pronounced under Xi.
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party claims the island as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to “reunify” with it, by force if necessary.
     
            But the CSIS report says Beijing has strong options that could not only keep the PLA out of the fight but could actually put the island democracy or its supporters like the United States in the role of initiators of military conflict to preserve Taiwan’s autonomy.
     
            The report notes that the China Coast Guard – like most coast guards around the world – is considered a law-enforcement agency. This means it can stop and regulate shipping around the island in what is termed a quarantine, which differs from a blockade.
     
            “A quarantine (is) a law enforcement–led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature,” the report says.
     
            International law considers a blockade an act of war, experts say.
     
            “A quarantine led by China’s coast guard is not a declaration of war against Taiwan,” the report says, and would put the US in a difficult position, its authors warn.

            Washington is legally required – under the Taiwan Relations Act – to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies it with defensive weaponry.
     
            US President Joe Biden has gone further than the legal requirement, saying repeatedly he would use American troops to protect Taiwan, a warning that appeared to deviate from Washington’s previous stance of “strategic ambiguity” and one that the White House officials have walked back.
     
            But if US military ships or aircraft intervened in what China says is a law enforcement operation, the US could be seen as initiating military hostilities.
     
            The report puts the China Coast Guard numbers at 150 ocean-going vessels and 400 smaller ones, like the PLA Navy, the world’s largest force in terms of fleet size. Beijing has hundreds of more vessels in its Maritime Safety Agency and maritime militia, fishing boats integrated into China’s military and law enforcement services.

China says military drills encircling Taiwan designed to test its ability to ‘seize power’
 
            Taiwan’s coast guard, with only 10 ocean-going ships and about 160 smaller ones, lacks the numbers to push back a quarantine effort, the report says.
     
            The CSIS authors note that quarantine actions taken by Beijing could be extremely limited and still have the effect of strangling Taiwan economically. Few operators would want to face the possibility of having their assets seized by Chinese authorities and might voluntarily stop servicing the island.
     
            “Demonstrated Chinese willingness to search and seize only a handful of commercial ships could have an outsized deterrent impact and discourage similar transgressions,” the report states.
     
            Limited search and/or seizure actions have an effect on flights to Taiwan as a quarantine can easily be extended to the air, the report states.
     
            Only a handful of flights would need to be warned off by Chinese aircraft to have a stifling effect on all traffic, according to the report.
     
            China regularly flies military aircraft around the island, sometimes dozens in a day. In the 24  hours ending at 6 a.m. Friday, 36 Chinese military aircraft crossed into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry says.
     
            Meanwhile, a quarantine, rather than a blockade, would not require China to close or restrict access to the Taiwan Strait, the CSIS report notes. That means Washington and its allies could lose one of their biggest claims to intervene under international law, preserving freedom of navigation in an international waterway.
     
            “If the quarantine is cast as a law enforcement operation, China can easily announce the end of the operation and claim its objectives were met,” the report says.
     
            To keep things even more low-key, China might not even need to use the word “quarantine” to begin an operation to isolate Taiwan, the authors say.
     
            Under its claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory, Beijing could require customs declarations to be filed before vessels can call in Taiwan. For those that fail to comply, enforcement mechanisms could have a chilling effect on all shipping.
     
            “Chinese law enforcement vessels will be authorized to board vessels, conduct on-site inspections, question personnel, and undertake other measures against noncompliant ships,” the report said.
     
            This idea allows a limited scope of operations for China. For instance, it could just target the island’s busiest port, Kaohsiung, responsible for 57% of Taiwan’s maritime imports and most of its energy imports, according to the study.
     
            Outside analysts who reviewed the CSIS report and spoke to CNN found it plausible. But they also harbored important doubts about how things might play out.
     
            Some mentioned how the economics don’t necessarily play in Beijing’s favor.
     
            “Maintaining the quarantine will be expensive and time consuming,” said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
     
            “Taipei won’t give up in under 60 days,” Schuster contends. “Can Beijing sustain the effort and possible international reaction for that long?”
     
            Efforts to upset the status quo across the Taiwan Strait could further erode Beijing’s foreign trade, the experts warn.

Those who back Taiwan independence face ‘self-destruction,’ China’s new defense minister warns in combative summit speech
 
            Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College in London, notes the challenges the Chinese Communist Party is already facing with an economy still struggling to recover from Covid-19 isolation that has seen growth rates plummet and new trade restrictions, like tariffs on its electric vehicle exports.
     
            Taiwan is a prominent industrialized economy, a crucial node in global supply chains and a manufacturer of the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors. A quarantine on the island would have economic repercussions not just domestically, but globally.
     
            While most nations diplomatically recognize Beijing over Taiwan, the island has forged increasingly strong unofficial relations with major western democracies, deepening those ties in recent years as Beijing’s threats have hardened.
     
            Taiwan and China are also deeply economically intertwined. Last year, 35% of the island’s exports went to the Chinese mainland, most of which were integrated circuits, solar cells and electronic components, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs.
     
            Imports from the mainland accounted for 20% of the island’s total imports in the same year. Between 1991 and 2022, Taiwanese companies invested a total of $203 billion in the mainland, according to Taiwan government statistics, creating millions of jobs in China.
     
            Additionally, quarantines can push populations to rally with the government, rather than rise up against it, says Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
     
            “Historical evidence shows that even severe blockades have limited coercive value, and a limited quarantine might result in a rally around the flag effect,” he says.
     
            A quarantine could also push Taiwan’s government to declare independence, something Beijing has repeatedly said would likely bring armed conflict, Kaushal warns.
     
            “This would then leave the (Communist Party) with the options of either escalation or a major setback,” he says.
     
            Patalano says for China, patience is the key to realizing its goal of “reunification.”
     
            Escalation, and certainly invasion, is not “cost-efficient,” he says. War costs not only lives but national wealth.

            Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there’s a problem: ChatGPT — soon to be integrated into Siri — is banned in China.
     
            In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.)
     
            The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap.
     
            But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies.
     
            According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone’s expected September launch, but it hasn’t reached a deal yet.
     
            Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
     
            The need to find a partner — and quickly — comes at a time when Apple’s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company’s second-largest market.
     
            Limitations on its new AI tools may not be specific to China. In a statement sent to CNN following the publication of this article, Apple said it “highly motivated” to bring the features to customers around the world, but it is facing regulatory challenges in the European Union, as well.
     
            The company said it doesn’t believe it will be able to roll out its AI features in Europe this year.
     
            “Due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features—iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence—to our EU users this year,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
     
            “Specifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,” it added. “We are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”
     
            In China, concerns around iPhone sales continue to mount as Chinese smartphone brand Huawei’s smartphone sales growth was 70% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research.
     
            If a solution is not worked out by fall, Chinese consumers may feel short changed and choose to wait until they can get the full AI experience with Apple, she added.
     
            “Apple is very likely to seek a local partner in China in place of OpenAI, because simply put, it needs to,” said Nabila Popal, a senior director at IDC Research. “Chinese consumers are expecting their premium phones to have the latest AI functionality and may hesitate to spend over $1000 for devices that don’t have all the AI bells and whistles.”
     
            “The real growth in China for Apple will come in the long term, as Apple Intelligence evolves offering more use cases, extends language support beyond English and when Siri can leverage other local AI models to provide the ChatGPT-like function,” Popal said.

            In the meantime, some AI companies in China may be better suited to target its consumers anyway, such as by offering more local dialects than what’s currently found in foreign AI models, Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research, noted.
     
            Apple wouldn’t be the first foreign company to work with the Cyberspace Administration of China for AI and smartphones. In January, Samsung teamed up with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to use its AI model to help power its translation service. It works with another AI firm Meitu for photo editing tools. In other parts of the world, Samsung uses its own propriety AI technology, along with Google’s (GOOGL) AI model Gemini, which is also banned in China.
     
            Samsung, however, accounts for less than 1% of the total market in China, according to Counterpoint Research.
     
            Although the clock is ticking for Apple to secure a partnership ahead of its fall software launch, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, believes it will be able to ink a deal in time.
     
            “Apple should be able to have a partnership aligned very quickly because it has such a strong global install base, and it would be a gem for these companies to work with them,” he said, noting that they’d soon be established as an an AI power player in the country.

            Authorities in cash-strapped Chinese cities are chasing companies for taxes dating back years, and in some cases decades, as they try to plug a hole blown in their finances by the real estate crisis.
     
            At least eight major listed companies in China have disclosed that they’ve received demands to pay historical taxes, in one case going as far back as the 1990s, in a development that has caused an uproar online and damaged already fragile business confidence.
     
            V V Food & Beverage, the country’s largest soy milk producer, said last week that one of its subsidiaries had received a demand for payment totaling 85 million yuan ($11.7 million) from the government of Zhijiang city in the central province of Hubei.
     
            The Zhijiang tax bureau said it recently found that the company had failed to file tax returns for 16 years from 1994 to 2009, the company said in a June 12 statement.
     
            The beverage maker isn’t the only one to fall foul of the apparent tax crackdown. At least seven other listed companies have reported similar demands over the past few months. In some cases, the companies have had to suspend production and lay off workers because they couldn’t absorb the hefty tax bills and penalties.

            The crackdown suggests local governments are searching for another way to fill their coffers, as they struggle under mounting financial stress because of a persistent property slump and economic weakness. The authorities have also publicized efforts to work more closely with police to find tax offenders, which has caused even more alarm.
     
            “Local governments in China are facing intense pressure to meet revenue targets, especially amidst economic slowdowns and broader fiscal challenges,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
     
            Regional governments have long relied on land sales as a major source of revenue, which are used to pay for everything from roads to healthcare. But a real estate crisis since 2021 has diminished that source of funding.
     
            Over the past year, local governments have turned to extraordinary measures to raise cash or cut spending, including fining restaurants for serving shredded cucumber on noodles without a license or cutting fuel subsidies in the middle of winter.
     
            After the tax crackdown went viral on social media, the State Administration of Taxation issued a statement Tuesday, trying to calm nerves.
     
            It acknowledged that some tax authorities had been inspecting companies for potential misconduct but denied that it had launched “any nationwide, industry-specific or centralized tax inspections.” 
 
            “We fully understand the concerns of the business community and the public, “ it added.
     
            The admission has whipped up speculation online this week that the establishment of “Police & Taxation Joint Combat Centers” in some parts of the country will result in much more aggressive taxation policies to come. The centers, which enable local police and taxation authorities to share intelligence and manpower, were first trialed in the city of Yichun in the southeastern province of Jiangxi in 2021.
     
            And the central government’s attempt to reassure has jarred with the local crackdowns, causing confusion and fear.

            Investigating possible back taxes from 20 or 30 years ago seems “extreme,” said Frank Tian Xie, a professor at the University of South Carolina Aiken.
     
            “If those companies indeed owed taxes before, why didn’t the authority go after them right away? … Why isn’t it the government’s negligence in tax collection that resulted in this fiasco?” he said.
     
            The resulting payments, including the unpaid tax, fines and interest could be “exorbitant” and lead to bankruptcies of many companies, he warned.
     
            The crackdown poses “severe risks to businesses already strained by operational challenges and external economic pressures,” Singleton said. “This could ripple through the economy, potentially exacerbating job losses and dampening investor confidence.”
     
            Beijing has been trying to reassure the private sector over the past year. Such businesses have become increasingly reluctant to borrow or invest, after years of regulatory crackdowns and stringent Covid restrictions battered their confidence.
     
            So far, the targets of the probes have been privately owned businesses in a variety of industries.
     
            V V has warned that its bottomline could take a hit. Last year, the soy milk seller made a net profit of only 209 million yuan ($29 million). And it’s still unsure how much it owes in fines, which could be potentially higher than the actual $11.7 million tax bill.
     
            Last Wednesday, Ningbo Bohui Chemical Technology, a producer of additives and light fuel oil, said it had to suspend production because of “operating cash difficulties.” The cash crunch was revealed shortly after the Ningbo government asked the company to pay taxes for one of its products sold between July 2023 and March 2024. The company said that would “affect” its net profits by about 500 million yuan ($69 million).
     
            The tax bureau later said the levy was imposed after a national rule was updated last year. The company said it shouldn’t have been subjected to the tax.

            “It [the new taxes] will have a significant adverse impact on the company’s 2023 performance and future production and operations,” Bohui said in a statement in March. “The company will swing from profits to big losses in 2023.”
     
            Zangge Mining, a producer of potassium chloride in the western province of Qinghai, said in April that it had received a demand from the Golmud city government to pay back taxes from 2019 to 2023. Including fines, the company needed to pay a total amount of 480 million yuan ($66 million).
     
            Chongqing-based PKU Healthcare, Shanghai-based Shunho New Materials, Shenzhen-based ChinaLin Securities, and Yunan-based Yixintang Pharmaceutical Group have also paid tax bills to local governments going as far back as seven years, according to separate statements made in March and April. The amounts paid vary from 8 million yuan ($1.1 million) to 310 million yuan ($43 million).
     
            The first company to report on the trend this year was LianTronics, a major LED display manufacturer. It said in January that the Shenzhen government had asked for payment of 19.8 million yuan ($2.7 million) in back taxes for 2017 and 20.2 million yuan ($2.8 million) in fines.

            The Philippines and China have blamed each other for the confrontation near the Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands on Monday, which took place during a Philippine mission to resupply its soldiers stationed on a beached World War II-era warship that asserts Manila’s territorial claims over the atoll.
     
            The incident is the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway.
     
            But the scenes captured in the latest footage mark an inflection point in the long-simmering tensions, with China adopting new, far more openly aggressive tactics that, analysts say, appear calculated to test how the Philippines and its key defense ally – the United States – will respond.
     
            China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims.
     
            Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said it was unprecedented for China’s maritime law enforcement to board a Philippine naval vessel.
     
            “They can be rubber boats, but it doesn’t change the fact that they are Philippine Navy vessels, and according to international law, they enjoy what we term as sovereign immunity,” Koh said. “That is very dangerous, because, if anything, that could even be construed as an act of war.”
     
            At a news conference on Wednesday, senior Philippine military officials said China’s Coast Guard officers “illegally boarded” the Philippine rubber boats, “looted” seven disassembled rifles stored in gun cases, “destroyed” outboard motor, communication and navigation equipment and took the personal cellphones of Filipino personnel.
     
            “They deliberately punctured our rubber boats using knives and other pointed tools,” said Alfonso Torres Jr., commander of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command.
     
            A Philippine Navy serviceman on the rubber boat lost his right thumb when the Chinese Coast Guard rammed it, Torres said.
     
            China’s Coast Guard also deployed tear gas, “blinding” strobe lights and continuously blared sirens, the AFP said.
     
            “Only pirates do this. Only pirates board, steal, and destroy ships, equipment, and belongings,” Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said in a statement.
     
            “The Chinese Coast Guard personnel had bladed weapons and our personnel fought with bare hands. That is what’s important. We were outnumbered and their weapons were unexpected but our personnel fought with everything that they had,” Brawner added.
     
            At a regular briefing with reporters on Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry was asked to comment on the allegations from the Philippines that their vessels were damaged by Chinese coast guard personnel wielding blades and firing tear gas.
     
            Spokesman Lin Jian did not address those allegations, and instead reasserted Beijing’s claims over the Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ren’ai Jiao in China.
     
            “The Philippine operation was not for humanitarian supplies at all. The Philippine vessels carried not only construction materials but also smuggled weapons. They also intentionally rammed into Chinese vessels and splashed water and threw things on Chinese law-enforcement personnel,” Lin said. “These actions have obviously aggravated tensions at sea and seriously threatened the safety of Chinese personnel and ships.”
     
            What happens in the South China Sea has profound implications for the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines that dates back decades.
     
            The latest clash marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial.
     
            It also comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be “very close” to an act of war.
     
            Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which has repeatedly stressed Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.

US blasts ‘aggressive’ China over South China Sea collision with Philippine ship
 
            US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday the “United States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions” by China.
     
            In a phone call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique A. Manalo on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China’s actions, “undermine regional peace and stability and underscored the United States’ ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.”
     
            Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank, said the footage released by the Philippines “clearly shows a Chinese attack on Philippine military assets,” which according to Washington and Manila’s defense pact would trigger mutual defense commitments.
     
            “However, in practical terms, the Philippines itself would have to initiate a move to activate (it) before the US would intervene militarily,” he said.
     
            In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines’ claims in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to assert historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.
     
            But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships – reinforced by militia boats – involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.
 
            The decision by China’s Coast Guard to use bladed weapons in the latest South China Sea clash has drawn comparisons with clashes between China and India on their disputed Himalayan border, where soldiers on both sides have fought fiercely with sticks, rocks and their hands.
     
            The Philippine personnel on the rubber boats are elite forces hailing from the Navy Special Operations Group, Koh said.
     
            “They are trained in combat. They did not retaliate against the Chinese because they’re just simply exercising restraint,” he said. “They probably have received instructions right from the top that under whatever circumstance they are not supposed to fight back against the Chinese and escalate the situation.”
     
            The footage released by the Philippine military also showed another striking development – that the clash took place right next to the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila’s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal.
     
            This is the closest China’s Coast Guard has come to the BRP Sierra Madre, Koh noted.
     
            “Under normal rules of engagement, the garrison would have fired warning shots,” he said. “The fact that this incident didn’t escalate further is because the Philippines exercised utmost restraint. That’s a simple fact.”
     
            China, Koh said, was trying to test both Manila and Washington “to find out exactly where the red line is.”
     
            “They wanted to see how far the US is willing to pledge its security commitment to the Filipinos. And of course, I don’t think Beijing is dumb enough not to have considered the possibility of having all these actions escalate the situation, but I believe that was a risk that they, in the end, decided to take.”

            A dozen tourists have been banned for life from China’s Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding for reportedly displaying bad behavior around the animals.
     
            A total of 12 people between the ages of 26 and 61 have been issued lifetime bans from the center, according to a post on the Research Base’s official WeChat account.
     
            The badly behaved visitors were “caught either throwing bamboo shoots, lollipop sticks, cigarettes, eggs or bread and spitting into the outdoor play area of the pandas on different occasions,” read the WeChat post.
     
            The pandas are all fine and healthy, it added.
     
            The Research Base has not publicly identified any of the banned guests or their nationalities. The WeChat post explained that the tourists were not all together – the offenses took place between April and June of this year.
     
            The base, which is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Chengdu, has detailed visitor instructions on its website.
     
            “Please be mindful of your own and animals’ safety,” reads one note. “Stay quiet and keep clear of animals; littering, spitting, throwing food into the animal activity field and other behaviors threatening animals’ safety are prohibited.”
     
            The advisory goes on to state that breaking these rules can result in “punish[ing] the violators with different degrees of penalties, such as criticizing and educating, banning them from entering the park within one year, banning them from entering the park within five years, or banning them from entering the park for life, and so on.”
     
            The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding opened in 1987 in Sichuan province in southwestern China. Its website states that the goal of the center is “to be a world-class research facility, conservation education center and international educational tourism destination.”
     
            The base is designed to re-create the natural habitat of giant pandas, which are native to China.
     
            The extreme measures that scientists partake in to create this environment can include dressing up in panda costumes sprayed with panda urine to “blend in.”
     
            In 2018, the World Wildlife Fund upgraded giant pandas from “endangered” to “vulnerable.” There are an estimated 1,800 pandas living in the wild today.

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            Battered by Western sanctions, Russia’s largest privately owned bank is expanding its business in the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            Alfa Bank, controlled by sanctioned Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, has launched a website and support service in Chinese for businesses in the country, it said in a statement earlier this week.
     
            The bank is also planning to open branches in Beijing and Shanghai, it noted in the statement issued Tuesday. That would make the lender the first private Russian bank to open full-service branches in the two major Chinese cities. The move, which was announced in September, could help Russian clients do business with China “even more efficiently,” it said at the time.
     
            CNN has requested further comment from the bank but hasn’t received a response.
     
            “Developing relations with China is one of the most important areas of work for the bank,” the lender had said in a statement in February.
     
            The bank is part of Alfa Group, one of Russia’s largest financial and investment conglomerates, which was founded by Fridman. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on the group and individuals linked to it, as part of their sweeping punitive measures against Moscow.
     
            The sanctions hit Russian banks hard. Alfa Bank made a loss of 117.1 billion rubles ($1.44 billion) in 2022, according to its annual report for that year. A year later, it seemed to bounce back, reporting profit of 120.9 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) for 2023.
     
            China claims to be neutral on the war but has increased ties with Russia on many fronts. Last year, its trade with Russia hit a record $240.1 billion, up 26% from 2022, according to Chinese customs statistics.
     
            The two countries have also reduced their dependence on the US dollar, with about 95% of mutual payments made in Russian rubles or Chinese yuan last year, according to comments by a top Russian official during his visit to Beijing in November.
     
            Last week, at the Group of Seven summit in Italy, the US and its allies accused China of enabling Russia’s war. G7 leaders also threatened further action, including sanctions, to punish Chinese entities that they say are helping Russia circumvent Western embargoes.
     
            In the Tuesday statement, Alfa Bank said it was already working with “thousands” of Chinese companies and had received a solid rating from a major Chinese credit rating agency. The Hong Kong Equity Investment Association had also recognized the bank as the “most technologically advanced” lender, it added.

            Manila has accused China of injuring Filipino personnel and damaging Philippine vessels during a South China Sea collision earlier this week, as tensions simmer over territorial disputes in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway.
     
            The Philippines and China have both blamed each other for the clash Monday near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands, with a statement from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday providing the first official confirmation from either side that injuries and damage were sustained. It follows multiple reports of injuries to Filipino sailors carried in local media and the Associated Press, citing sources, as well as from US officials.
     
            The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs “denounces the illegal and aggressive actions of Chinese authorities that resulted in personnel injury and vessel damage,” the statement said, without specifying how many sailors were wounded or providing any details of their injuries.
     
            At least eight Filipinos were injured in the incident – including one sailor who lost a thumb, the AP reported Tuesday, citing an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
     
            CNN has reached out to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Coast Guard for comment.
     
            Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times published photos of the incident online on Wednesday, showing a Philippine rigid-hulled inflatable boat sandwiched between a large China Coast Guard vessel and at least three other Chinese boats.
     
            When asked about the incident in a news conference on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, “law enforcement measures taken by the Chinese Coast Guard on the spot were professional and restrained, aimed at stopping the illegal fishing by Philippine ships, and no direct measures were taken against Philippine personnel.”
     
            The incident Monday is the latest in a string of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine ships that have raised the possibility of the South China Sea becoming a flashpoint for global conflict. It comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be “very close” to an act of war.
     
            Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which has repeatedly stressed Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.

            Known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren’ai Jiao in China, Second Thomas Shoal is a submerged teardrop-shaped reef located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan.
     
            It lies in the Spratly Islands, a mostly uninhabited archipelago where oil and gas reserves have been found, and which is claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
     
            The Philippines carried a resupply on Monday to its soldiers stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila’s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal.

US blasts ‘aggressive’ China over South China Sea collision with Philippine ship
 
            The China Coast Guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship “ignored China’s repeated solemn warnings” and “deliberately and dangerously” approached a Chinese vessel in “an unprofessional manner,” resulting in a collision.
     
            A supply ship and two rubber boats from the Philippines had attempted to “illegally” deliver supplies to the stranded warship, China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu said.
     
            China’s Coast Guard also said it took measures including “warnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions” against the Philippine vessels.

            The United States on Monday condemned China over a collision with the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea, the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations that have raised the potential of a flashpoint for global conflict in the vital waterway.
     
            A Chinese vessel and a Philippine supply ship collided near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands early Monday, according to statements from both nations, which blamed each other for the incident.
     
            China’s Coast Guard said it took measures including “warnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions” against the Philippine vessels.
     
            China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims.
     
            In a post on X, Washington’s ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson said the US condemned China’s “aggressive, dangerous maneuvers,” which “caused bodily injury” and “damaged Philippine vessels.”
     
            Neither the Philippines nor China reported injuries or damage from the collision, which comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be “very close” to an act of war.
     
            Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which has repeatedly stressed Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.
     
            The incident Monday is the latest in a string of recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing that have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines.
     
            US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday the “United States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions” by China.
     
            Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on Monday discussed the collision with Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Maria Theresa Lazaro.
     
            China had “obstructed the Philippines from executing a lawful maritime operation in the South China Sea, interfering with the Philippines’ freedom of navigation,” Campbell said, according to a State Department readout.
     
            The latest incident marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial.
     
            The Chinese coast guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship “ignored China’s repeated solemn warnings” and “deliberately and dangerously” approached a Chinese vessel in “an unprofessional manner,” resulting in a collision.
     
            “The Philippines is entirely responsible for this,” the coast guard said in a statement, a charge rejected by the Philippine military as “deceptive and misleading.”
     
            Instead, Philippine authorities accused Chinese ships of “dangerous maneuvers” that included “ramming and towing” of Philippines vessels.
     
            In a statement on X, Philippine army spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said the “main issue remains to be the illegal presence and actions of Chinese vessels within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, which infringes on our sovereignty and sovereign rights.”
     
            In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.
     
            But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway. Over the past year China Coast Guard ships – reinforced by maritime militia boats – have been involved in multiple clashes that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.

            China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu on Monday accused a supply ship and two rubber boats from the Philippines of “illegally” delivering supplies to the stranded warship.
     
            “We once again warn the Philippines: Any form of infringement and provocation is futile. The Chinese Coast Guard is on full alert and ready to resolutely safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” Gan said in a statement.
     
            In a departure from past confrontations with China when his team were quick to issue statements and visuals, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela provided no comment to CNN on the collision.
     
            The Armed Forces of the Philippines also declined to give details of the latest run-in.
     
            Instead, Philippine officials made broad statements denouncing China’s actions.
     
            “China’s dangerous and reckless behavior in the West Philippine Sea shall be resisted by the (Armed Forces of the Philippines.) Their behavior contravenes their statements of good faith and decency,” said Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto C. Teodoro, Jr.
     
            “We will exert our utmost in order to fulfill our sworn mandate to protect our territorial integrity, sovereignty, and sovereign rights. It should now be clear to the international community that China’s actions are the true obstacles to peace and stability in the South China Sea.”

            Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has further cut its large stake in BYD, which vies with Tesla as the world’s largest electric car (EV) maker, as global trade tensions escalate over Chinese EVs.
 
            The legendary investor’s conglomerate sold another 1.35 million Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD on June 11, trimming its stake to 6.9% from 7.02%, a Hong Kong stock exchange filing showed Monday. The sale was valued at 310.5 million Hong Kong dollars ($40 million).
     
            It’s the first major sale of BYD shares by Berkshire in ten months and the 14th since August 2022, when it started gradually reducing its stake in China’s top EV maker. BYD shares had closed at a record high in June of that year.
     
            The latest sale comes as tensions soar over exports of cheap EVs from China.
     
            The country has become a dominant force in the global EV market, thanks to significant policy support from the government and heavy state subsidies. But a flood of cheap models has raised the specter of another trade war with its Western trading partners.
     
            Last week, the European Union hit EVs imported from China with additional tariffs because of what it sees as Beijing’s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers.

            That is expected to deal a blow to the the country’s manufacturers, which view Europe as a key export market. BYD will face an additional levy of 17.4% on top of the bloc’s existing 10% duty on car imports, according to an announcement from the European Commission.
     
            Beijing, which has big dreams for its EV industry, has threatened to retaliate. On Monday, it announced an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork from the EU.
     
            Tensions had previously escalated between China and the United States over the same issue. In May, the Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on EV imports from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to boost American jobs and manufacturing.
     
            Buffett said last year that it’s “imperative” for the US and China to settle their differences and “get along with each other.”
     
            BYD, which was founded by Wang Chuanfu in Shenzhen, has had an extraordinary rise over the past three decades. It overtook Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) at the end of last year as the biggest seller of electric vehicles on the planet. (Tesla regained its position in the first quarter of this year, but they’re neck and neck.)
     
            In 2008, Berkshire spent $230 million in buying BYD shares at an average of HK$8 ($1.02) apiece. Back then, BYD’s share price had fallen to a record low during the global financial crisis.

            That investment has proved to be one of the firm’s most successful ever.
     
            In June 2022, the Chinese EV maker hit a record closing high of HK$331.4, about 41 times the price Berkshire had paid originally.
     
            Since then, Berkshire has been on a selling spree, with its first major sale disclosed in August 2022.
     
            So far, Berkshire has sold about 149 million shares.
     
            Berkshire has not disclosed the reason for the sales. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN.
     
            Last month, Buffett mentioned BYD at Berkshire’s 2024 annual meeting, crediting his closest business partner Charlie Munger, who passed away in November, for his call to buy the stock. Munger “was right, big-time,” he said.
     
            Berkshire still holds 75.7 million Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD, which were worth about 17.6 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.3 billion) by Tuesday.

            The question wasn’t even directed toward President Joe Biden, but his determination to get in an answer created a revealing moment about the war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war machine and deepening US tensions with China.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked at a press conference in Italy last week about whether China was selling Russia arms for use in the war. Biden, who was standing beside him, waited for Zelensky to say President Xi Jinping told him he would not do so, before delivering a parting shot and ending the event. “By the way, China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it. So, it is, in fact, helping Russia.”

Russia’s Putin to visit North Korea in rare trip as anti-West alignment deepens
 
            The comment appeared to signal a hardening tone toward Beijing following months of US warnings that it shouldn’t help its friends in Moscow over the war. NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg reinforced the tough new line during a visit to Washington Monday that included Oval Office talks with Biden.
     
            “Publicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he’s taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China’s fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,” Stoltenberg said at The Wilson Center. “At the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.”
     
            Concerns that America’s enemies are aiding Russia’s war effort are sure to grow with the impending trip by Putin to North Korea, which the Kremlin said would have a “very eventful” list of events, including with the isolated Stalinist state’s tyrannical leader Kim Jong Un.
     
            The idea of an anti-US front among Russia, China, North Korea and Iran has long preoccupied foreign policy experts in Washington. Up until recently, US intelligence agencies have assessed that differences between the uneasy partners make formal alliances unlikely. But all those powers have one big thing in common: a desire to thwart American goals and power. Each is also subject to a brutal autocratic regime that is threatened by the democracy that unites the US and its European and Asian allies.
     
            The announcement that Putin is headed to Pyongyang raised the state of alert in Washington and caused expressions of concern from across the government.
     
            In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress that Russia’s need to replenish its military supplies had forced it to grant “long-sought concessions” to North Korea. She did not specify the extent of the cooperation, but her comment sparked speculation that Moscow was offering nuclear or missile expertise. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell added to the intrigue last week when he said at a Stimson Center event that the North Koreans have embarked on a series of “provocative” actions including by supplying Russia with artillery and missiles.
     
            And he added: “We have a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia and they have had a substantial impact on the battlefield.”
     
            But the US doesn’t seem to know what Kim will get in return.
     
            “What is Russia going to provide in exchange to North Korea, hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products?” Campbell said. “We don’t know but we are concerned by that and are watching carefully.”
     
            He added: “The entire scope of the Russia/North Korea relationship is something we follow carefully and are concerned about.”
     
            State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Monday that North Korea had unlawfully transferred dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to aid Russia’s war effort. “We have seen those munitions show up on the battlefield in Ukraine. So, we know that they are using DPRK ammunition to threaten Ukraine and kill Ukrainians,” he said.
     
            And White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said that while the US wasn’t concerned about Putin’s trip, it was looking to see whether it worsened security conditions in Ukraine and in Northeast Asia. “What we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries not just because of the impacts it’s going to have on the Ukrainian people, because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets, but because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean Peninsula.” Kirby added: “We’re certainly going to be watching that very, very closely.”
     
            Putin and Kim clearly know Washington is watching.
     
            In an article in North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the Russian leader wrote: “We highly appreciate the DPRK’s unwavering support for Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.”
     
            And he called the isolated state Russia’s “committed and like-minded supporter, ready to confront the ambition of the collective West.”

            Adidas says it has started an investigation into allegations of “compliance violations” in China, a key market for its sportswear.
     
            Chinese state media Jiemian reported last week that local executives had been accused of embezzling “millions of euros” in an unsigned letter written by whistleblowers calling themselves employees of Adidas China. The letter was widely publicized online.
     
            Claudia Lange, head of media relations at the apparel giant, told CNN on Monday that it had received an anonymous letter on June 7 “indicating potential compliance violations in China.”
     
            “Adidas is currently intensively investigating this matter together with external legal counsel,” she said in an emailed response. Lange declined further comment pending the outcome of the inquiry.
     
            Shares of Adidas fell 3.7% on Monday.
     
            Jiemian wrote that the letter from whistleblowers had been sent directly to the company’s German headquarters before being shared on social media.
     
            The reported complaint alleged that a senior executive in Greater China who manages Adidas’ marketing budget had embezzled millions of euros and taken huge kickbacks from external advertising and celebrity agencies. Several members of the executive’s team and other employees were also implicated, according to a copy of the letter published by the Chinese state media outlet.
     
            Adidas Greater China’s overall promotional budget amounted to 250 million euros ($268 million) a year, including expenses dedicated to marketing, branding and trade fairs, Jiemian reported, citing the letter.
     
            The senior manager was also accused of “nepotism” and “workplace bullying,” including isolating some employees and forcing them to leave, the whistleblowers’ reportedly said. People who followed her instructions were promoted, they added.
     
            The complaint also alleged that one of the manager’s subordinates had received “millions … from suppliers and physical items such as real estate.”
     
            The whistleblowers vowed to disclose the matter to the media and law enforcement if the company did not address the allegations.
     
            Adidas is the world’s second largest sportswear retailer. Greater China — a region that encompasses mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — contributes 15% of the company’s sales.
     
            In mainland China, Adidas is the second largest international sportswear brand behind Nike (NKE). The German company has enjoyed a rebound in sales growth in China after Beijing scrapped Covid restrictions at the end of 2022.
     
            But its market share has declined significantly from pre-pandemic levels because of competition from local rivals and a controversy over its refusal to use Xinjiang cotton.
 
            In 2021, Adidas — along with H&M, Nike and other big Western apparel brands — faced a boycott in China because of the stand they had taken against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.
     
            Adidas is well known for playing the “celebrity” card in its marketing in China. It has previously worked with popular actors and singers as brand ambassadors, including Yang Mi, Dilraba and Yi Yangqianxi.

            Beijing has launched an investigation into prices of pork from the European Union, targeting a major EU food export just days after Brussels hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China.
     
            The move risks escalating tension in one of the world’s biggest trading relationships and will heighten fears among EU exporters that Beijing could go after their goods to retaliate against the provisional EV tariffs.
     
China’s Ministry of Commerce said Monday that local agricultural producers had requested an anti-dumping investigation into pork and pig by-products from the EU and that a preliminary inspection had found sufficient grounds for a formal probe into whether their prices are artificially low.
     
            It added that the investigation should conclude within a year but could be extended by six months if required.
     
            A hike in import tariffs could be very costly for European pork producers if it ends up hurting demand in China, the world’s largest pork market and the main destination for EU pork exports. The EU is the second-biggest pork producer after China.
     
            According to EU customs data, the bloc exported more than €2.5 billion ($2.7 billion) worth of pork, including offal, to China last year. Almost half of that came from Spain, with the Netherlands, Denmark and France also exporting substantial amounts.

Europe risks trade war with China by hiking tariffs on its electric cars
 
            Beijing has already launched an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU and could impose tariffs that would hit French cognac makers. China could also target European wine and luxury goods, according to analysts at Rhodium Group, a think tank.
     
            Olof Gill, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, told reporters Monday at that the EU would follow the investigation into pork products “very closely” and “intervene as appropriate” to ensure the probe complies with rules set by the World Trade Organization.
     
            Responding to a question about the EU’s considerable agricultural subsidies, Gill added that the bloc was “not the least bit worried” that the WTO could find in China’s favor. “Any subsidies… are strictly in line with our WTO obligations,” he said.
     
            Beijing had been widely expected to use targeted measures to try to dissuade EU officials from permanently adopting higher tariffs on electric cars imported from China, a decision the EU must make by November. The provisional tariffs are due to take effect on July 4.
     
            The European Commission announced last week that additional tariffs of between 17.4% and 38.1% would be applied to EVs manufactured in China on top of the existing EU duty of 10%. That takes the highest overall rate to close to 50%.
     
            Beijing immediately denounced the measure, which could hurt its ambitions to grow EV exports and is likely to hasten efforts by Chinese carmakers to set up factories in Europe.
     
            Brussels is also investigating China’s state support for wind turbine companies and solar panel suppliers amid concerns that the country’s industrial overcapacity is flooding markets elsewhere with cheap exports.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/china/g7-accuses-china-enabling-russia-war-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,G7 leaders accuse China of ‘enabling’ Russia war on Ukraine in stark warning,"China’s support for Russia is “enabling” its war in Ukraine, leaders of the world’s most advanced economies warned Friday in a hardening of tone against Beijing, threatening further sanctions against actors that materially support Moscow’s ...","Jun 17, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
            China’s support for Russia is “enabling” its war in Ukraine, leaders of the world’s most advanced economies warned Friday in a hardening of tone against Beijing, while threatening further sanctions against actors that materially support Moscow’s war machine.
     
            The stark warning, issued at the end of the annual Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy, comes as the United States is stepping up diplomatic efforts to convince Europe to adopt a tougher stance on China over its role in aiding Russia’s military-industrial complex.
     
            “China’s ongoing support for Russia’s defense industrial base is enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and has significant and broad-based security implications,” the G7 leaders said in the communique Friday.
     
            “We call on China to cease the transfer of dual-use materials, including weapons components and equipment, that are inputs for Russia’s defense sector.”
     
            The leaders also threatened further actions, including sanctions, to punish Chinese entities that they say are helping Russia circumvent Western embargoes.
     
            “We will continue taking measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia’s war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia’s acquisition of items for its defense industrial base,” the joint statement said, vowing to impose “restrictive measures to prevent abuse and restrict access to our financial systems.”
     
            American officials have accused China of helping Russia expand military manufacturing, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Moscow to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.
     
            Beijing has refuted the allegation, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods.
     
            At a United Nations Security Council meeting about arms supply to Ukraine also on Friday, China’s envoy reiterated that defense, while accusing the US of using the war as “an excuse to smear China” and suppress its companies.
     
            The US and European Union have already slapped sanctions on Chinese companies, and this week, the US imposed fresh sanctions on China-based firms supplying semiconductors to Russia.
     
            “China does not supply weapons, but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it,” US President Joe Biden said at the summit on Thursday. “So it is, in fact, helping Russia.”
     
            The G7 statement came a day ahead of a Ukraine-backed peace summit in Switzerland, which China did not attend, citing the lack of representation from “both Russia and Ukraine.”
     
            The G7 is also taking a tougher stance on China’s economic policies, especially on the issue of industrial overcapacity, vowing to take actions against “unfair practices” to “level the playing field and remedy ongoing harm.”
     
            “We express our concerns about China’s persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive non-market policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity in a growing range of sectors, undermining our workers, industries, and economic resilience and security,” the joint communique said.
     
            The day before the summit, the EU announced additional tariffs on electric vehicles (EV) imported from China following a months-long investigation, over what it sees as Beijing’s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers.
     
            Last month, the US also imposed new tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security – including EVs and clean-energy products.
     
            The G7 also voiced strong opposition to what it says are China’s unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China seas.
     
            “We continue opposing China’s dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries’ high seas freedom of navigation,” the joint statement said.
     
            “We express serious concern about the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine vessels.”
     
            In a statement Monday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs slammed the G7 position saying it “manipulated issues” and “slandered and attacked China.”
     
            “At present, the G7 has long deviated from the original intention of coordinating and stabilizing the international economic environment, and has increasingly become a political tool to maintain the hegemony of the United States and the West,” spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing.
     
            Its “weaponizing” of trade relations would “ultimately only shoot itself in the foot,” Lin added.

            Prices of new homes in China suffered their biggest fall in nearly a decade last month, in a sign that Beijing’s “historic” real estate rescue has not yet revived demand.
     
            Prices in 70 major cities were down 0.7% in May from April, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures showed on Monday. That’s the steepest month-on-month drop since October 2014, according to Reuters calculation.
     
            According to separate calculations by the Macquarie Group, prices of existing homes in those cities fell by 7.5% year-on-year last month, marking the biggest decline on record.
     
            A month ago, Beijing unveiled wide-ranging measures to rescue the crisis-hit property market, including asking local governments across the country to buy unsold homes from beleaguered developers and easing rules on purchases.
     
            “To be fair, one month is too short for the housing rescue package to take effect,” said analysts from Societe Generale on Monday.
     
            Measures, including efforts to provide cheap loans to state-owned enterprises for buying unsold homes from distressed developers, will “take time” to have an impact on the property market, the analysts said.

            Still, other numbers on the real estate sector remain bleak.
     
            Property investment for the first five months of the year dropped 10.1% from a year ago, according the NBS on Monday.
     
            New property sales fell 28% during the same period.
     
            Some parts of the Chinese economy reported a more optimistic picture, according to a separate set of top indicators released by the NBS on Monday.
     
            Retail sales increased 3.7% in May, accelerating from a 2.3% rise in April and beating market forecasts.
     
            Much of that boost came from a massive government trade-in programs for used cars and old home appliances, aimed at bolstering domestic consumption. The Labor Day “Golden Week” holiday, which ran from May 1 to May 5, also helped reignite some consumer spending.
     
            Industrial output lost some momentum, growing 5.6% in May from a year ago, compared to April’s 6.7% increase. Fixed asset investment also missed expectations.
     
            But China’s exports jumped 7.6% in May, marking the fastest pace since April 2023, according to customs data released earlier this month. Imports, however, fell short of estimates.

China’s consumer prices rise for first time in six months. But it’s too soon to say deflation is over
 
            “The growth is highly uneven,” with exports as the driver and the property sector acting as a drag, said Macquarie analysts.
     
            The threat of deflation continues to haunt the world’s second largest economy as domestic demand remains weak.
     
            The consumer price index inched up just 0.3% in May, unchanged from April, according to the NBS last week. That was slightly below expectations.
     
            Producer prices dropped 1.4%, down for a 20th consecutive month.
     
            “While China’s growth remains uneven, we think more policy support is likely to come through to help keep growth on track for this year’s GDP growth target [of around 5%],” said analysts from HSBC on Monday.
     
            “More attention will turn towards next month’s Third Plenum (of the Communist Party) which will highlight economic reforms for the coming years,” they said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/17/australia/australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk/index.html,Chinese officials’ attempt to ‘block’ formerly detained journalist mars Australia goodwill tour,Apparent efforts by Chinese officials to stand in front of Cheng Lei during a news briefing shone a spotlight back on frictions between the countries.,"Jun 18, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
Chinese Premier Li Qiang’s four-day visit to Australia this week was set to be focused on repairing long-strained relations between the two countries. But apparent efforts by Chinese officials to stand in front of an Australian reporter during a press briefing have shone a spotlight back on frictions between the countries.
     
            Cheng Lei, a TV anchor who was held in detention in China for more than three years before her release in 2023, told Sky News Australia the officials went to “great lengths” to block her from the cameras during a press event Monday where Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed cooperative agreements.
     
            Video footage appears to show two people involved in the incident, with one of them, described by the outlet as a Chinese embassy employee, trying at one point to push closer to a seated Cheng, despite being blocked by another woman, identified by Sky News as an Australian official, who intervenes to give her space.
     
            “I’m only guessing this is to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look, but that in itself was a bad look,” Cheng told Sky News, where she has been employed as a news presenter and columnist since late last year.
     
            Cheng added that such behavior was “typical” as Chinese officials wouldn’t want “voices of discord or the presence of someone who’s a bit controversial” when they are aiming to present a “friendly facade.”
     
            Multiple media outlets that were also in attendance at the press conference, including the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, reported the same details.
     
            CNN has requested comment from China’s embassy in Canberra.
     
            China’s security state keeps tight control on media and information within the country, where officials are not subject to the kind of robust questioning common to democratic countries.
     
            Beijing has also long been condemned by Western nations and rights groups for wrongful and arbitrary detentions.
     
            Cheng, previously a business anchor for China’s state broadcaster CGTN, was detained by Chinese authorities in August 2020 on opaque espionage charges that came as diplomatic tensions were escalating between Beijing and Canberra.

China hands Australian writer a suspended death penalty in a move Canberra condemns
 
            The mother of two spent more than three years in detention before being released by Beijing and returned home to her family in October, weeks before Albanese made the first visit of an Australian leader to China in seven years.
     
            Speaking to Sky News ahead of the news conference Monday, Cheng said it was a “very emotional day” for her to be covering the major visit.
     
            “Surely the fact that one minute I’m sitting in incarceration and being raised as a topic at these visits then the next minute I’m actually covering the visit … is testament to how wonderful freedom is and democracy is,” she said.
     
            Cheng’s detention had been a deep point of contention between the two governments, as has the jailing of writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen who earlier this year was handed a suspended death penalty sentence for espionage following years of detention. Yang has denied the charges, which rights groups have said are politically motivated.
     
            Albanese said he raised Yang’s case with Li, but declined to give an update on the health of the democracy activist, who has said he fears he could die in jail due to health issues.
     
            When asked during a press conference later about Cheng being blocked from view by officials during the document signing, Albanese said he didn’t see the incident described but added it was “important that people be allowed to participate fully and that’s what should happen in this building or anywhere else in Australia.”
     
            The situation Monday stands as a stark reminder of Beijing-Canberra tensions and deep concerns within Australia, a staunch US ally, about China’s authoritarianism amid a trip that was otherwise meant to instill goodwill.
     
            The four-day visit of Li, China’s No. 2 official, to Australia is the highest-level trip to a US-allied country of any Chinese official in seven years. It comes as the two countries have made strides in mending deep tensions over issues of trade, security and Beijing’s alleged political influence in Australia and the South Pacific.
     
            Speaking alongside Li following the signing ceremony, Albanese called the visit “another important step in stabilizing” the relationship.

China to send a new pair of giant pandas to Australia in sign of warming ties
 
            The Chinese premier, speaking via a translator, pledged that China would work with Australia in “a spirit of mutual respect, seeking common ground while showing differences and mutual benefit.”
     
            Li announced Sunday that China would provide a new pair of giant pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australian after its current pair return to China later this year – extending a classic gesture of friendship from China often called “panda diplomacy.”
     
            China would also add Australia to its visa-waiver program, Li said Monday.
     
            Details were not immediately announced but follow similar visa arrangements with other countries in recent months as China struggles to draw in more international tourists to boost its flagging economy following years of Covid-19 border restrictions. Li announced a waiver scheme for New Zealand during a visit there Friday.
     
            The two leaders agreed to greater military-to-military communication, according to Albanese.
     
            The agreement follows recent close encounters of the two powers. In May, a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of an Australian helicopter over the Yellow Sea in a move Albanese condemned at the time as “completely unacceptable.”
     
            Li’s Australia visit comes as China has gradually rolled back a number of crippling trade controls that it placed on key Australian imports including beef, barley, timber, coal and wine from 2020 after then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.

            Thousands of people have been evacuated in southeast China after heavy rains hammered the region over the weekend, triggering floods and deadly landslides, authorities and state media said Monday.
     
            According to state-run broadcaster CCTV, over 35,000 people were evacuated as of Saturday. As of Monday morning, more than 10,000 people were evacuated in Meizhou, the hardest flood-hit city in Guangdong province.
     
            Seventeen waterways in the major Han River basin “recorded flooding above alert level,” including two rivers at record flood levels, according to the Ministry of Water Resources on Monday.
     
            Guangdong province, an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people, is among parts of southern China that are subject to annual flooding from April to September. But the region has faced more intense rainstorms and severe floods in recent years as scientists warn that the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent.
     
            Those warnings were underscored in April, when deadly floods submerged parts of Guangdong after rain poured for multiple days.
     
            On Monday, heavy rains wrought further devastation, with social media videos from the city of Meizhou, eastern Guangdong, showing river water almost overflowing as it lapped at bridges and partially submerged vehicles.
     
            More than 130,000 households in the city and suburbs were without power as of Monday morning, while classes were suspended, CCTV reported.
     
            “Authorities are still trying to reach some towns and villages” in the area, CCTV said.
     
            Further upstream along the Han River, a flood alert was issued in Fujian province due to heavy rainfall, according to its provincial alert center. Four people were killed in a series of landslides in the coastal province, CCTV reported Monday.
     
            Social media footage from Fujian, home to 40 million people, showed flood water rushing through the streets of towns and villages,
     
            Shanghang county in southwest Fujian recorded record rainfall of 375 millimeters (nearly 15 inches) in the past 24 hours, which represents 18% of its average annual rainfall, the province’s meteorological service said in a statement Monday.
     
            China has been grappling with extreme weather this month as heavy rains inundate the south while severe drought and record temperatures scorch the north.
     
Other parts of China are also facing earlier and longer extreme heat periods and droughts each year, causing widespread power shortages and disruptions on food and industrial supply chains.

            What’s old is new again. This time it’s a centuries-old skirt design that’s proving popular in China. The “mamianqun” or “horse face skirt” is being worn in cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu as young people in China are giving the attire a modern twist, with unconventional pairings and choice of fabrics.
     
            While once the sole purview of “hanfu” enthusiasts (a renaissance of the ancient clothing traditionally worn by ethnic-majority Han Chinese before the Qing dynasty) and reserved for special occasions, the pleated often brocade skirts have become a part of everyday wear.
     
            The popularity of the skirt has been wrapped into a broader trend being dubbed “xinzhongshi,” or “new Chinese style” — which merges all manner of contemporary design with traditional Chinese aesthetics, applied to everything from clothing to furniture.
     
            While the idea isn’t new, and was once considered old-fashioned, the wide-ranging term is being used as a marketing tool on China’s lucrative e-commerce platforms, with retailers quick to turn Gen Z’s patriotic, and at times, nationalistic sentiments, for profit.
     
            On Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Xiaohongshu, searches for “new Chinese style” and “new Chinese style outfits” hashtags exceeded 100 million in early April, according to state news agency Xinhua. Besides fashion, the posts show everything from stuffed leather armchairs with the curves of traditional Chinese wood furniture to mobile phone wallpapers of landscape paintings.

Wearing pride: Centuries-old Chinese fashion is making a comeback
 
            The state-backed China National Textile and Apparel Council estimates the market size of “new Chinese style” clothing reached 1 billion yuan (nearly 138 million dollars) in 2023.
     
            On Xiaohongshu, a 33-year-old user, who goes by the handle Momo and didn’t give her real name for privacy reasons, frequently gives tips on how to style Chinese clothing. In one post, she demonstrated how you can top an oversized pink sweatshirt with a black mamianqun, pairing it with a matching baseball cap and sneakers.
     
            “More and more young people are willing to use traditional culture as a new way to express their attitudes. That’s a good thing and very cool,” she told CNN in a text message.

Dior accused of ‘culturally appropriating’ centuries-old Chinese skirt
 
            It’s mostly young people following the trend, agrees Huang Weizhe, a 32-year-old designer and manager of local fashion brand Longfuji.
     
            On social media, Huang shares ways to dress in “new Chinese style,” and in one post wears a loose silk shirt with jeans.
     
            “There is no set rule in the ‘new Chinese style’ (trend) that you must follow, so it is more inclusive. This is the style that young people like now,” he told CNN over the phone.
     
            Fashion designers like Samuel Gui Yang, whose collections have long taken inspiration from Chinese heritage, are seeing more interest from mainland China turn to their brands due to the “new Chinese style” trend.
     
            But unlike the mamianqun, which is a literal nod to the past – and being mass produced – his 9-year-old brand has been about bridging the gap “between Shanghai and London” and drawing from the rich tapestry of what it means to be Chinese, in China and abroad.
     
            “I think my wider audience (is) really a fan of…the way we bring in this ‘Chineseness’ (the) heritage details in a more subtle way,” he said in a phone interview.
     
            For Yang, the aesthetics and themes of Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee’s 1994 movie “Eat Drink Man Woman” represent his idea of what “new Chinese style” should be. The film about the lives of a master chef and his three daughters navigating the tensions between modernity and traditions, personal freedom and family. Yang said, “subtly reflects the lifestyle of Chinese people, especially the direct connection between a dinner table and interpersonal relationships.” The film, he added, “provides us with a lot of inspiration for our design journey,” and that he always draws from the “80s and 90s Asian dressing style.”
     
            There’s the Lee denim jacket inspired by Hong Kong martial arts and film star Bruce Lee and the Ailing dress, named after Shanghai-born American novelist Eileen Chang. At Shanghai Fashion Week this March, he showcased a long-sleeved bias cut qipao with roll-up sleeves (pictured top), giving the classic silhouette a fresh update.
     
            For Ian Hylton, designer and decades-long China resident, “new Chinese style” is a misnomer. His eponymous menswear label draws heavily on Chinese dress styles and design motifs – think elegant loose silk mandarin collar shirts, Tang puffer jackets and cashmere coats with button knots.
     
            “I’m kind of not a fan of this term ‘new Chinese style,’ because to me that’s like saying new French clothes, new Italian clothes,” Hylton told CNN over the phone. “There’s nothing new. There’s a new way to approach it, but it’s somehow being treated like a trend, like short or long skirts. They’re part of a culture, they’re the fabric and makeup of a culture.”
     
            Hylton’s wife, Min Liu, launched her own Chinese-aesthetics inspired label Ms. Min in 2010, a reaction, he said, to the fact that most people in the country weren’t wearing Chinese clothes. Hylton is the company’s president.
     
            “When I arrived in China…there was not a billboard, there was not an advertisement, there was not an anything that featured a Chinese person,” said Hylton, who moved to China in 2005 as the creative director of luxury fashion label Ports 1961. “Everything was a foreign face…everything that was foreign was good and everything that was local was disrespected.”
     
            The tides he believes have turned in the last decade or so with young Chinese becoming more aware and confident of their place in the world, and embracing China’s culture and history. Domestic fashion labels also saw a boost during the pandemic, as strict travel restrictions prevented mainland Chinese from buying luxury goods abroad.
     
            Meanwhile Momo, the Xiaohongshu user, said the popularity of “new Chinese style” has been down to “serious commercialization,” which she doesn’t necessarily buy into.
     
            Douyin, China’s TikTok released a report in March showing a 841% increase in the sale of the mamianqun skirts that typically retail for around 200 yuan (roughly US$28), on its e-commerce platform compared to the year before. State broadcaster CCTV reported that Cao county in Shandong province, which it said accounts for around half of the country’s mamianqun production, sold 550 million yuan (almost $76 million) worth of skirts in the first two months of the year, a surge attributed to the run-up of the Lunar New Year holiday.

            But some of the “new Chinese style” products are “shoddily made” she said, though she thinks that their designs will improve with time.
     
            Regardless of trends, Momo said she will continue to teach her 33,000 followers how to wear traditional clothing as much as possible – out and about, to study and to work.
     
            “Whenever we wear ‘new Chinese style’ or hanfu and mamianqun, it’s a way we can invite more people, including those around the world, to understand (our) culture.”

            “It will be more comfortable and faster, reducing the travel time by about half, and will cover a wider range of destinations, including popular tourist attraction cities,” John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said in a press statement, referring to the previous overnight train routes that connected Hong Kong with China’s two biggest cities.
     
            Those intercity railway services, Beijing-Kowloon and Shanghai-Kowloon, launched in 1997. The train ride to China’s capital took around 24 hours while the journey to Shanghai was about 19 hours.
     
            The services were suspended during the pandemic in 2020 and have been replaced by the new high-speed options that launched on June 15.
     
            But while the new trips do indeed slash the overnight travel time by almost half, the high-speed sleeper services take slightly longer than the daytime bullet trains already in service connecting Hong Kong and the two cities in mainland China.
     
            Currently, the train company operates one daily high-speed connection to Beijing, which takes around 8.5 hours, and one to Shanghai, which is around 7.5 hours.
     
            Why bother with the longer journey then? The new sleeper trains might not be the fastest way to get between Hong Kong and Beijing or Shanghai, but they are a great option for business travelers who need to arrive well-rested before standard office hours, as well as leisure tourists who don’t want to waste a full day on the train or wish to save money on accommodations.
     
            Each of the electric multiple unit (EMU) trains used to service the routes has 16 carriages, including 13 sleeper cars, two second-class seating cars and one dining car.
     
            There are three types of seats to choose from: Second class (without a bed), sleeper and deluxe sleeper.
     
            A standard sleeper class cabin consists of two bunk beds, sleeping four passengers, in a cabin. The deluxe version, only available on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route for now, features a bunk bed, wardrobe and sofa.
     
Prices range from HKD937 to HKD1,506 ($120-$193) for the Hong Kong-Beijing route and HKD682 to HKD2,128 ($88-273) for the Hong Kong-Shanghai route.
     
            Passengers who want to book a seat can reserve their tickets on China Railway’s official ticketing site 12306.cn. Note that for trains departing from Hong Kong, you have to search “hkwestkowloon.”
     
            International travelers can also book through ticketing platforms such as Trip.com or buy their tickets at the West Kowloon Station directly.
     
            A joint immigration checkpoint inside West Kowloon Station allows passengers to avoid additional checks when crossing the border in and out of Hong Kong. However, travelers still need to have a valid China visa or travel document to ride the train. (Although part of China, Hong Kong is governed under a separate legal framework.)
     
            Opened in 2018, the 26-kilometer Hong Kong high-speed railway is a part of the larger Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL).
     
            Costing more than $10.7 billion to build, the Hong Kong section connects the city with China’s 25,000-kilometer national high-speed rail network.
     
            But the project, which marked the first time mainland Chinese laws were given jurisdiction inside Hong Kong territory, stirred much controversy, even well before its opening.
     
            The massive price tag, the limited traveling speed (the Hong Kong section has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers/hour – much lower than the usual 300 kilometers/hour due to its short distance) and the political implications all cast a shadow over the new railway.
     
            Controversy aside, the introduction of the Express Rail Link provided an alternative way to travel to major Chinese cities through Hong Kong – and avoid China’s notorious flight delays.
     
            The Hong Kong station now offers direct trips to 78 destinations around China and some 70,600 passengers use the network daily according to official figures.

            China will provide a new pair of giant pandas to Australia, Premier Li Qiang said on Sunday, in the latest sign of warming relations between the two countries.
     
            Li made the announcement at Adelaide Zoo as he began a four-day trip to the country, Australian public broadcaster ABC reported.  He said China will send a new pair of giant pandas to the zoo in Southern Australia after its current pair return to China later this year, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Li’s visit to Australia, the first by a Chinese premier in seven years, comes after Beijing lifted high tariffs on Australian wines and rolled back barriers on barley, timber and coal that were imposed following then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call in 2020 for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.
     
            Relations between the countries have thawed however, since the Labor party swept to power in Australia in 2022.
     
            China is Australia’s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly one third of its overseas trade, according to the Australian government. Meanwhile, commodities from Australia are important for Beijing’s efforts to revive its stuttering economy.
     
            China loans pandas to more than 20 countries as envoys of friendship from Beijing – a program that’s often referred to as “panda diplomacy” – which is at times seen as a barometer of relations.
     
            Giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni, the only pandas in the southern hemisphere, have been on loan to Adelaide Zoo since November 2009. In 2019 a deal was struck to extend their stay for another five years, according to Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua.
     
            Li, China’s second-highest ranked official, said he was glad to see that “that though far away from homeland, Wang Wang and Fu Ni have been well looked after and settled down to live a happy life in Australia,” according to a statement from China’s Foreign Ministry.“They have become envoys of friendship between China and Australia, and a symbol of the profound friendship between the two peoples,” Li said in the statement.

            China is grappling with extreme weather as severe drought and record temperatures scorch the north while heavy rains inundate the south, raising concerns about food security in the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            Areas of the country that produce a lot of rice and wheat have been badly affected, disrupting spring and summer planting seasons.
     
            The Ministry of Agriculture said Thursday that drought and heat have had an adverse impact on the planting season in some northern and central provinces, and it warned that temperatures were expected to surpass 35 Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) in the coming days.
     
            An emergency alert covering at least seven provinces, including the major agricultural regions of Henan and Shandong, was already in place because of dry, hot conditions.
     
            “The recent persistently high temperatures have accelerated the loss of water in the soil and (caused) drought in some areas, which has negatively affected the summer sowing season,” the ministry said in a statement. “The drought is likely to continue and the task of protecting the summer planting season is difficult.”
     
            In Henan, China’s top wheat producing region which accounts for a quarter of total output, rainfall in May was 70% lower than the yearly average, Yang Wentao, a provincial official, told national broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday.
     
            Parts of the country are experiencing a major heat wave.
     
            The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) said on Wednesday that 28 regional weather stations broke their respective records for the highest temperature ever recorded in mid June. The city of Fenyang in the northern province of Shanxi registered its highest temperature ever recorded at 40.2 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
     
            China had its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to the National Climate Center. Last year was the country’s hottest year on record.
     
            Meanwhile, southern parts of the country, the top rice growing region, have been grappling with weeks of downpours.
     
            In April, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement that rainfall in parts of the region had risen by 50% to 80%, and had even doubled in some areas. It made a series of recommendations on reducing damage to growing “early rice” saplings, which are planted in March and harvested in June.
     
            The CMA said on Thursday that heavy rainfall had occurred in the Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and Guizhou regions — some of them major manufacturing and industrial centers. Hunan and Jiangxi are two of China’s biggest rice producers.
     
            China’s State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, a national coordination agency, issued an emergency response to both the flooding in the south and the drought in the north on Thursday, warning of a high risk of flash floods and geologic hazards.
     
            These rains appear to be related to a seasonal monsoon pattern that can lead to intense showers over short periods.

            A Dutch warship was harassed by Chinese military aircraft in the East China Sea on Friday, the Netherlands said, becoming the latest country to accuse Beijing’s forces of initiating potentially unsafe encounters in international waters.
     
            In a statement Friday, the Dutch Defense Ministry said two Chinese fighter jets circled the frigate HNLMS Tromp several times, while its marine patrol helicopter was “approached” by two Chinese warplanes and a helicopter during a patrol.
     
            “This created a potentially unsafe situation,” the statement said.
     
            CNN has asked the Chinese government for comment on the Dutch accusations.
     
            The Tromp was operating in the East China Sea in support of a multinational coalition enforcing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, known as the Pacific Security Maritime Exchange (PSMX), according to a statement from the European Union.
     
            The UN Security Council has passed multiple resolutions since 2006 imposing sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear weapons program.
     
            PSMX partner nations include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the US State Department.
     
            Before patrolling in the East China Sea, the Dutch frigate had made a port call in Busan, South Korea, where it participated in exercises with the South Korean Navy, the EU statement said.
     
            Tromp joins a growing list of vessels and aircraft that have accused China’s People’s Liberation Army of conducting possibly unsafe maneuvers in the East and South China Seas and beyond in recent years.
     
            Last month, Australia accused a Chinese fighter jet of firing flares into the path of a naval helicopter operating from the destroyer HMAS Hobart over international waters of the Yellow Sea. The Hobart was also enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea.
     
            “This was an unsafe maneuver which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,” a statement from Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said at the time.
     
China defended that action by its military and rejected Australia’s claim that the interception was unsafe.
     
            “Under the guise of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions, Australian warships and aircraft deliberately approached China’s airspace to cause trouble and provocation, endangering China’s maritime and air security,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters at a regular briefing last month.
     
            “As a warning, the Chinese military took necessary measures at the scene. Relevant operations are legal, compliant, professional and safe.”
     
            The incident was similar to an encounter in late October, when Canada said a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of a Canadian military helicopter over the South China Sea.

CNN took an 11-day cruise through some of the most-contested waters on Earth. Here’s what we learned
 
            “The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN after the October incident.
     
            China also defended its actions in that incident and accused Canadian forces of conducting an unspecified “malicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.”
     
            Two weeks before the South China Sea encounter, a Royal Canadian Air Force patrol plane reported an unsafe intercept by a Chinese jet while it was supporting the UN enforcement of sanctions on North Korea.
     
            China, which says its forces act in accordance with international law while protecting Chinese interests, has repeatedly claimed that US-led alliances in the Pacific are a threat to its security.
     
            Earlier this month in a speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington had made “historic progress” in developing alliances and partnerships that have enhanced security in Asia in the past three years.
     
            In a Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and also blamed NATO for the Ukraine war.
     
            Hours later, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of “creating division and provoking confrontation” in the region.
     
            “The US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,” Jing Jianfeng, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department at China’s Central Military Commission, told reporters in Singapore.

            A major heat wave is forecast to spread across large swathes of northern China this week, bringing record high temperatures to some areas, according to China’s meteorological authorities.
     
            The heat wave, which began on Saturday, has already triggered government weather alerts and follows the country’s hottest spring on record.
     
            The national observatory on Monday issued an orange alert for high temperatures – the second most severe warning – as sweltering heat engulfed the country’s north.
     
            On Sunday, in the coastal province of Shandong, seven national meteorological stations recorded the highest temperature for early June, while temperatures in northern Hebei province and the western region of Xinjiang soared above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC).
     
            The heat wave is forecast to further expand in scope in the coming days, the NMC said in a statement.
     
            Local governments have also issued warnings.
     
            Beijing on Saturday raised its first yellow alert for high temperatures this summer, warning residents to avoid going outdoors during the hottest parts of the day.
     
            The alert came as tens of thousands of high school graduates in the Chinese capital were finishing their national college entrance exam – a two-day, highly competitive test known as the “gaokao.” A school in Beijing’s Chaoyang district handed out free ice cream to parents waiting outside the gate in the grueling heat, state media reported.

World’s biggest polluter just had its hottest year on record, marked by deadly extreme weather
 
            Zheng Zhihai, chief forecaster at the National Climate Center, told the state-run Global Times that temperatures in most parts of China were expected to be higher than usual this summer, and the number of high-temperature days would also be greater than usual.
     
            Zhong said the high temperatures were linked to El Niño, a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific.
     
            China saw its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to the National Climate Center.
     
            Meanwhile, parts of southern China have been grappling with weeks of downpours. In Guangdong province, record rainfall unleashed deadly floods in April, with one tribunal of the Pearl River experiencing the earliest arrival of its annual flood season since records began in 1998.
     
            China also saw its hottest year on record in 2023, as the world’s biggest polluter confronted a series of relentless heat waves and other extreme weather events driven by the human-caused climate crisis.
     
            The average temperature in China last year stood at 10.7 degrees Celsius – the highest since records began in 1961, according to the National Climate Center, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. It broke the previous record of 10.5 degrees set in 2021.
     
            China’s exceptional warmth echoed global trends – with scientists confirming that 2023 was officially the hottest year on record, the result of the combined effects of El Niño and climate change.

            As profit margins get squeezed, temperatures are rising in the world’s biggest car market.
     
            A tense exchange between two major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers in recent days highlights the pressures they face as a price war in the industry intensifies.
     
            It all started on Saturday, when Yu Chengdong, the chairman of Huawei’s smart car unit, implied that rival EV maker BYD is racing ahead because of low prices rather than the quality of its cars.
     
            “Currently, BYD is … number one in the rat race, because it has extremely low costs,” he said at a public forum in Shenzhen.
     
            BYD, a carmaker Elon Musk once laughed at, overtook his Tesla (TSLA) at the end of last year as the biggest seller of electric vehicles on the planet. (Tesla regained its position in the first quarter of this year, but they’re neck and neck.)

A brutal elimination round is reshaping the world’s biggest market for electric cars
 
            “We are not good at competing with ultra-low prices. Rather, we are good at competing with value, intelligence, luxury, comfort, safety, high quality, excellent and comfortable user experience,” Yu added.
     
            While top executives from the EV industry often post on social media about a range of topics, including technology and advertising, they rarely name rival companies, especially when criticizing them.
     
            In recent months, a price war has escalated in China’s hyper-competitive EV industry, with manufacturers battling for consumer attention with deep discounts or newer, cheaper models.
     
            The industry suffered a blow in May when US President Joe Biden quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles from China to 100%, effectively sealing off one of the world’s biggest passenger car markets. It also faces potential extra import duties from the European Union as soon as next week.
     
            Yu’s comments about BYD have gone viral on Chinese social media and provoked a sharp retort from the EV giant.
     
            “Personally I have great respect for Huawei. But I feel that if Mr Yu can make fewer comparisons, either at press conferences or public forums, more people will like him, and Huawei’s brand would also gain points,” Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, said in a video post on Weibo on Thursday.
     
            Li pointed out that Huawei is also trying to “compete with low prices,” as the company has made significant price cuts in the past year.
     
            “We welcome other brands to show their cars at our booth and compete with ours on the same stage,” he added.
     
            On the same day, Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting that its core strength lies in “technology and innovation.”
     
            BYD will invest 100 billion yuan ($13.8 billion) in developing smart EVs in the future, focusing on generative artificial intelligence and large model technologies, Wang added.
     
            Earlier this week, BYD was among a group of nine automakers to receive a green light from the Chinese government for public trials of advanced auto driving.

            Competition in the world’s largest EV market has become cutthroat. The country has more than 200 EV manufacturers who are grappling with huge oversupply and slowing consumer demand.
     
            A brutal price war kicked in last year, with even market leaders like BYD and Tesla rushing to cut prices to retain or expand their market positions.
     
            While deep price cuts by manufacturers and government subsidies for car buyers have boosted the volume of sales, overall profitability has fallen.
     
            Wang said earlier this year that a “brutal elimination round” is coming for the industry, urging companies to form economies of scale and brand advantages “as soon as possible.”

            A record number of high school students across China have begun sitting a highly competitive exam that could decide their future in a country grappling with a slowing economy and diminishing opportunities for young graduates.
     
            The two-day national college entrance exam, known as “gaokao,” is the world’s largest academic test. It has also been billed by Chinese state media as “the world’s toughest” college entrance exam due to its high stakes, competitiveness and intensity, with students pouring everything they’ve learned in 12 years into a handful of subject tests that each last less than two hours.
     
            More than 13.4 million students registered for the exam this year, surpassing last year’s record of 12.9 million to make it the biggest “gaokao” ever held in China.
     
            Chinese students spend years cramming for the punishingly difficult exam, as a high score is the only way to get into the country’s top universities. The exam includes subjects like Chinese literature, math, English, physics, chemistry, politics and history.
     
            The overwhelming majority of students get just one shot at the grueling test, unlike US students who can retake SAT exams.
     
            And the specter of China’s slowing economic growth and soaring youth unemployment has piled on the pressure to perform.
     
            On Friday, the first day of the exam, parents waited anxiously outside school gates after sending their children off into exam halls. Many parents and teachers were dressed in red, the color of victory in China, and some held sunflowers – deemed an auspicious flower for academic success.
     
            Authorities have rolled out a slew of measures to maintain order and stability around the examination sites.
     
            In Beijing, traffic police appeared on the streets as early as 6 a.m. to help smooth and reduce the flow of traffic around a school near the Summer Palace, a famous scenic spot popular with tourists, state news agency Xinhua reported.
     
            In Shanghai, taxi dispatch centers started accepting bookings for students taking the exam from a week ago, according to Xinhua.
     
            Chinese social media was awash with good-luck messages and encouragement, with “gaokao” trending as a top search topic on X-like platform Weibo.
     
            Many Chinese celebrities – and even some international stars – have posted on social media wishing the exam takers good luck.
     
            British soccer legend David Beckham posted his well wishes on Weibo, where he boasts 10 million fans.
     
            “I just want to say ‘good luck’ to all the students that are taking their exams soon. You’ve worked so hard. Jin Bang Ti Ming!” Beckham said in a video, adopting a Chinese phrase meaning achieving honors and success in important exams.

            The US and its closest intelligence partners are warning that China has intensified a campaign to recruit former Western military pilots and other service members to train its own aviators, according to a joint bulletin released by the nations on Wednesday.
     
            Beijing has for years struggled with its air operations — including both pilot proficiency and its technical capabilities to counter western aviation tactics — even as it has built up its air and naval forces in preparation for a possible military takeover of the island of Taiwan.
     
            Western-trained pilots can teach Chinese military personnel everything from air combat tactics to how to land on an aircraft carrier, according to a US official. They can also give China a precious window into how it can counter western combat tactics.
     
            The warning was issued by the so-called Five Eyes nations, which share higher-level intelligence among them: the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
     
            “To overcome their shortcomings, China’s People’s Liberation Army has been aggressively recruiting Western military talent to train their aviators,” said Michael Casey, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, part of the US intelligence community. “Recent actions by Western governments have impacted these operations, but PLA recruitment efforts continue to evolve in response.”
     
            Asked about the bulletin on Wednesday, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon “always expect that our pilots will uphold the standards that they are trained under, and that they keep their training specific to the United States.”
     
            “I think there are national security risks there,” she said.
     
            The bulletin, released by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, warns that Beijing has used private companies that often hide their ties to the Chinese military to attract western pilots, contacting them via headhunters or professional networking sites and offering “lucrative contracts and the opportunity to fly exotic aircraft.” Military pilots, flight engineers, and air operations center personnel, as well as “technical experts with insight into Western military tactics,” it said, have been “the most sought-after targets.”
     
            These private companies have set up notionally independent operations in third countries like South Africa, Singapore and Laos, according to the US official. Former western pilots — which number at least in the dozens — are training Chinese military officials who then return to China and, in turn, train more pilots there, this person said.
     
            The US has sought to crack down on the tactic, in part by sanctioning some of the third-party companies. But China has adapted, according to intelligence officials.
     
            “There have been efforts to incorporate entities in different locations under different names,” said an NCSC official. “There have also been variations in recruitment pitches and approaches.”
     
            The bulletin caps years of growing concern by the US and its allies that the PLA was seeking to gain insight into western military tactics and technology by recruiting its former pilots.
     
            It also comes as tensions have continued to grow between China and Taiwan, just weeks after China launched large-scale military drills surrounding the island in what it said was punishment for “separatist acts” after Taiwan elected a new president.
     
            Adm. John Aquilino, the former head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told Congress in March that combined, the PLA Navy and PLA Air Force “constitute the largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific.”
     
            In September, Gen. Charles Q. Brown — then the Air Force chief of staff and now the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff — warned in a letter to the Air Force that foreign companies were “targeting and recruiting US and NATO-training military talent” to assist the People’s Liberation Army.
     
            “By essentially training the trainer, many of those who accept contracts with these foreign companies are eroding our national security, putting the very safety of their fellow servicemembers and the country at risk, and may be violating the law,” Brown said. “Just as I am asking for your help, I have also asked for help from our allied Air Chiefs to address the same issue within their ranks.
     
            In January of this year, US and NATO officials held a conference focused on countering Chinese recruitment of allied personnel to enhance their own air operations.
     
            The issue burst into the public consciousness in October of 2022, when former US Marine fighter jet pilot Daniel Duggan was arrested in Australia for allegedly training PLA pilots how to land on aircraft carriers.
     
            He has been held in a maximum-security prison in Australia since 2022, CNN has previously reported, after he worked in Beijing for six years. An indictment in 2017 alleged that Duggan trained Chinese pilots while he was still a US citizen, between November 2009 and November 2012.
     
            Duggan, now a naturalized Australian citizen, has denied the allegations that he broke US arms control laws.
     
            That same month, the UK Ministry of Defense issued a security alert after several of its military pilots were also found to have been training the PLA Air Force. The pilots had been contracted through a private South African company that offered high salaries. Canada and Australia announced investigations into the practice that same year.
     
            The US is seeking Duggan’s extradition and is awaiting a final decision from the Australian Attorney General. The Arms Export Control Act, which bans weapons sales, also prohibits the training of foreign military personnel without explicit authorization.
     
            The bulletin on Wednesday also comes after multiple US service members have been arrested for allegedly leaking classified intelligence to China. In March, a US Army sergeant was charged with allegedly leaking classified information about advanced US weapons in exchange for $42,000.
     
            Last August, two US Navy sailors were arrested for allegedly sending sensitive military information to Chinese intelligence officers.
     
            Matt Olson, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for national security, said in a press conference at the time that the charges against the two sailors “demonstrate the (People’s Republic of China’s) determination to obtain information that is critical to our national defense by any means, so it can be used to their advantage.”

            A Chinese government agency established to promote trade with Russia has been trying to source drone detectors and jammers, adding to concerns that Beijing may be supplying dual-use technology to Moscow.
 
            Foreign companies were seeking “unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment,” including drone detectors and jammers, according to a procurement notice posted on May 22 on the official WeChat account of the Guangdong Provincial Association for Promotion of Trade with Russia.
     
            The association, overseen by the province’s Commerce Department, said buyers wanted “interference generators, drone detectors (trade names BorisTone, Assel Labs and Bulat) or other similar technology solutions, drone suppressors, and communication band jammers.”

            Bulat drone detectors were developed by 3MX, a Russian company. They are known for being used by the Russian army during its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
     
            The procurement document has been removed from the association’s WeChat social media account, but it still exists on the account of another government body in the same province.
     
            The Yunfu City’s Association for the Promotion of International Trade posted the same notice on WeChat last week, asking any “interested company” with the products to submit their information.
     
            Drone jammers emit signals at frequencies that drones use to operate and transmit information, overwhelming their ability to communicate.
     
            Ukraine has relied heavily on drones since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion and has piled resources into advancing technology and domestic manufacturing. It has been using them to target Russia’s oil and gas industry, still the biggest source of cash for Moscow’s war effort despite Western sanctions.
     
            The posting of the Chinese notices comes as Beijing faces significant pressure from Western governments to ensure that dual-use products with military applications are not finding their way to Russia’s defense sector or its forces on Ukraine’s battlefield.
     
            The United States has accused Beijing of covertly supporting Moscow’s war by selling such dual-use goods. They include things like semiconductor chips, navigation equipment and jet parts.
     
            Beijing says it is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and has repeatedly said that it does not provide weapons to either side and “strictly controls” the export of dual-use items.
     
            A person who answered the phone at the Guangdong association denied that the document was intended to secure orders for Russian customers. He told CNN that it was removed because it was “improper.” When asked for further detail, he said that the request was made on behalf of buyers in Kazakhstan, before abruptly ending the call.
     
            CNN has also reached out to the Yunfu trade association for comment.
     
            According to its official WeChat account, the Guangdong association’s main responsibilities include supporting the province’s global trade work, connecting with Russian buyers or sellers, organizing exchanges, coordinating trade settlement with Russia and providing Russia-related legal consultation for Chinese traders. 
 
            China has forged deeper ties with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for the country. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, both men praising the close relations between their countries.
     
            Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a meeting of defense chiefs in Singapore that China’s support to Russia would extend the war in Ukraine, adding Ukraine’s voice to concerns raised by the US and European leaders in recent months.
     
            “Beijing does provide a lot of different ways of direct support to Russia’s war in Ukraine, whether it is either the purchase of oil to help fuel its economy or helping them reconstitute the defense industrial base,” said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

            Mastro said she is “not particularly surprised” that local Chinese governments would help Russian companies seek drone equipment. But, she doesn’t believe Beijing will have more “direct” involvement in the war.
     
            Last week, the US warned it could act against Chinese firms and financial institutions in response to Beijing’s alleged backing of Russian war efforts.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April that Washington had already imposed sanctions on more than 100 Chinese entities and individuals for allegedly helping support Russia’s war effort.
 
            “Beijing is trying to walk a very thin line between adhering to what the United States is asking them and, specifically, to their foreign policy principle of not selling weapons and equipment and [engaging in] foreign military interference,” said Mastro.
     
            “What they would say is that they are doing their best to prevent the selling of military material to Russia, but things are always [going to] get through,” she said.

            Any tourist wandering through the glitzy lobby of Singapore’s Shangri-La Hotel this weekend would have stumbled on a rather bizarre scene.
     
            Military officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris.
     
            Every few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts.
     
            This gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious.
     
            The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate.
     
            The stakes this year could hardly be higher.
     
            War rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China’s increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge.
     
            The Singapore summit brought key players together.
     
            Where else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing’s new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance?
     
            There was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine’s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky – and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun.
     
            Given its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia – and in particular China’s behavior in the region – stalked the conference.
     
            In his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea.
     
            “If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,” he said, “that is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.”
     
            Two days later, China’s Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of “blackmail” in the maritime dispute.
     
            “There is a limit to our restraint,” said Admiral Dong Jun.
     
            “I saw that as a threat,” said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago.
     
            “In decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,” she said.  “Now they’re very self confident…they intervene in all the sessions.”
     
            The open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers.
     
            After his speech on Sunday, China’s Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing’s increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms.
     
            The “separatists” in Taiwan’s newly-elected government would be “nailed to the pillar of shame in history,” he said.

            But equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known.
     
            Senior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China’s People’s Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim “the eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.”
     
            “I respectfully disagree,” Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause.
     
            “The Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,” Austin continued. “This was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.”
     
            Later that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt.
     
            “We stand with you,” Ng Eng Hen, Singapore’s minister of defense, later said to Zelensky.
     
            But the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky’s speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit.
     
            He also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine’s mortal enemy.
     
            “With China’s support to Russia, the war will last longer.  That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China – who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,” Zelensky told journalists.
     
            It was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

            Instead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto – the new leader of the world’s most populous Muslim majority nation – spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah.
     
            Another political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in.
     
            The Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial.
     
            Asia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world’s most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines.
     
            Republican Senator Dan Sullivan requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release.
     
            “This is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,” Sullivan’s statement said, calling the verdict a “gross abuse of our justice system.”
     
            But speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America’s “commitment to liberty and democracy,” saying this marked a competitive advantage over “authoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.”
     
            Sullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia.
     
            “The dictators we are allied against…are ally poor,” Sullivan said.
     
            But there are clearly concerns about US reliability.
     
            An academic from Japan – Washington’s closest ally in Asia – asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump’s possible re-election.  He called it a “nightmare” scenario.
     
            That triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage.
     
            Singapore’s Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, “we will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.”
     
            I vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump’s inauguration.
     
            Trump’s then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president.
     
            “Bear with us,” Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the “America First” commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order.

            “Once we’ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.  We will still be there.”
     
            Seven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers.
     
            One by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control
     
            “The world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,” Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts.
     
            In this tense geopolitical environment, it’s far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.

            US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Cambodia on Tuesday to meet with the country’s prime minister and defense minister, as Washington becomes increasingly concerned that Phnom Penh may grant China’s military exclusive access to a key naval base.
     
            Austin’s trip to the Cambodian capital marks his second visit to the Southeast Asian country as Secretary of Defense but is the first time a United States defense chief has traveled to Cambodia specifically to hold a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, Defense Minister Tea Seiha.
     
            The outreach reflects the US’ desire to forge a better relationship with Cambodia, defense officials said, particularly as Beijing’s influence over the country has only continued to grow in recent years.
     
            “We believe there is potentially an opportunity, with leadership transition in Cambodia, for us to sit down and talk about how our relationship might have a more positive and optimistic path in the future,” a senior defense official told reporters, referring to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who took office last year following his father Hun Sen’s nearly four-decade rule. “This isn’t a visit that is about significant deliverables and achievements.”
     
            Austin did express the US’ concerns, however, about China’s funding of and presence at Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, officials said. In December, China docked two warships at the base, which is in a highly strategic position close to the South China Sea.
     
            Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia’s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an “aid project” to strengthen Cambodia’s navy and called assertions otherwise “hype” with “ulterior motives.”
     
            Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea, a characterization the US and many of its Indo-Pacific allies reject. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented harassing others operating in the area, including American ships and planes.
     
            The US has been particularly alarmed in recent weeks by China’s attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea using powerful water cannons. China also carried out large-scale military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan last week as “punishment” for its inauguration of a new president, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island’s sovereignty.
     
            The behavior underscores why the US is worried about the possibility that China could establish a new military outpost so close to the key waterway.
     
            “There are no doubts about where our concerns are,” a Pentagon spokesperson said following Austin’s meetings, when asked about Ream. “Meeting face-to-face gives us a chance not only to speak clearly about our concerns, but to talk about how we might work together in the future to strengthen our relationship. And we don’t ask any country to choose between partners.”
     
            But as China and Cambodia have reaffirmed their military cooperation, relations between Washington and Phnom Penh have grown increasingly strained.
     
            Cambodia canceled military exercises with the US in 2017 and demolished a US-built facility at Ream in 2020, as the US has repeatedly condemned the country’s poor human rights record and democratic backsliding. Last year, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on Cambodian individuals in response to Cambodia’s election, which the State Department characterized as “neither free nor fair.”
     
            On Tuesday, however, Austin met with former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who now serves as president of Cambodia’s Senate after transferring power to his son, a military general. Defense officials are particularly hopeful that Austin can forge a relationship with Prime Minister Hun Manet, who, like Austin, attended the US Military Academy at West Point and is seen as more westernized than his father.
     
            In a readout following Austin’s meetings, the Pentagon said the “officials discussed opportunities to strengthen the US-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on de-mining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia’s access to US PME [professional military education] programs. They also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defense establishments.”
     
            Austin’s visit to Phnom Penh capped a five-day trip to Asia, where he attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and warned of China’s “coercive” activities in the region while working to deepen the US’ relationships with key Asian leaders.
     
            In a meeting with China’s Defense Minister Dong Jun last week, their first face-to-face, Austin said the US wants to keep military-to-military channels open with the Chinese to avoid misunderstandings and escalation.
     
            In a combative speech later on, Dong appeared to agree with that, but he also slammed “external interfering forces” for selling arms and having “illegal official contacts” with Taiwan — a thinly veiled reference to the US, which maintains close yet unofficial ties with the island democracy. In the same remarks, however, Dong said Beijing “never acts from the so-called position of strength.”
     
            A senior US official told CNN that the speech was “at complete odds with the reality” of China’s People’s Liberation Army’s “coercive activity across the region.”

            China’s Chang’e-6 lunar probe departed from the far side of the moon on Tuesday, moving a step closer to completing an ambitious mission that underlines the country’s rise as a space superpower.
     
            In a symbolic moment before takeoff, China also reportedly became the first country to display its national flag on the moon’s far side, which permanently faces away from Earth.
     
            The probe, carrying the first lunar rocks ever collected from the far side of the moon, took off and entered lunar orbit early Tuesday Beijing time, following successful sample collection over the previous two days, according to a statement from the China National Space Administration (CNSA).
     
            Its return journey to Earth is estimated to take about three weeks, with a landing expected in China’s Inner Mongolia region around June 25.
     
            The successful return of the samples would give China a head start in harnessing the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration – an increasingly competitive field that has contributed to what NASA chief Bill Nelson calls a new “space race.”
     
            This is the second time China has collected samples from the moon, after the Chang’e-5 brought back rocks from the near side in 2020.
     
            Earlier this year, Nelson appeared to acknowledge China’s pace – and concerns about its intentions – were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions.
     
            A photo posted by CNSA Tuesday and trending on China’s X-like Weibo platform shows the drilled surface in a shape resembling the Chinese character “zhong,” or “middle” in English – the first character in the Chinese word for “China.”
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe withstood “the test of high temperatures” and collected the samples by drilling into the moon’s surface and scooping the soil and rocks up with a mechanical arm, CNSA said.
     
            After collecting the specimens, Chang’e-6 extended a robotic arm to raise the Chinese flag, according to an animation released by CNSA.
     
            The flag, made from the volcanic rock basalt, was designed to resist corrosion and the extreme temperatures on the far side of the moon with an eye on future lunar missions, a Chang’e-6 engineer told state-broadcaster CCTV.
     
            The rock “was crushed, melted and drawn into filaments about one third of the diameter of a human hair, then spun into thread and woven into cloth,” said engineer Zhou Changyi.
     
            “The lunar surface is rich in basalt,” Zhou added. “Since we’re building a lunar base in the future, we will most likely have to make basalt into fibers and use it as building materials.”
     
            Chang’e-6 successfully landed on Sunday morning in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the moon’s oldest impact basin formed some 4 billion years ago. It marked the second time a mission has successfully reached the far side of the moon, after China first completed that historic feat in 2019 with its Chang’e-4 probe.
     
            If all goes as planned, the mission — which began on May 3 and is expected to last 53 days — could be a key milestone in China’s push to become a dominant space power.
     
            The country’s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole, a region believed to contain water ice.
     
            Samples collected by the Chang’e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say – while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China’s lunar ambitions.
     
            “The enigmatic lunar far side is so different from the lunar nearside in so many ways, that without returned samples, lunar scientists can’t fully understand the moon as an entire planetary body,” said James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has collaborated with Chinese scientists leading the mission. “Returned samples from Chang’e 6 will permit major strides to be made in solving these problems.”
     
            The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang’e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2.
     
            China plans to launch two more missions in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon.
     
            Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration.
     
            Last year, India landed a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia’s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon’s surface.
     
            In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the lunar south pole.
     
            That landing – the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades – is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there as soon as 2026 and build its scientific base camp.

            As Taiwan’s biggest rock band took to the stage in Beijing late last month, their home island was reckoning with the latest act of Chinese aggression.
     
            For two days, the self-governing democracy was encircled by Chinese warships and fighter jets in the largest military exercises in over a year.
     
            Addressing the tens of thousands of fans at the sold-out Bird’s Nest stadium, Mayday’s lead singer Ashin did not mention the aggression. But what he did say has since caused no less friction.
     
            “We Chinese people must eat roast duck when we come to Beijing!” he said.
     
            It may sound like an innocuous travel tip, but his choice of words was freighted with political meaning. Ashin – one of Taiwan’s biggest music stars – had referred to himself as Chinese, instead of Taiwanese.
     
            The choice of words delighted the crowd, but sparked immediate anger back home – reflecting the precarious position of Taiwanese stars with mainland appeal.
     
            Growing numbers of people in Taiwan – especially the younger generation – view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese. Many have no desire to be part of China, whose authoritarian ruling Communist Party views the self-ruled island as its territory, despite having never controlled it.
     
            Beijing has long sought to bolster its claims by emphasizing the cultural and historical ties between the two sides, but polls show only 3% of Taiwan’s population identify primarily as Chinese – while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese, and less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification with China.
     
            Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, Beijing has become more aggressive toward Taiwan, and has abandoned official ties since the island’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016. But there is still considerable cultural overlap. Both sides speak Mandarin, meaning musicians from Taiwan – population 23 million – often seek to enter the lucrative market of 1.4 billion across the strait.
     
            As Beijing and Taipei have drifted further apart politically, these artists have come under increasing pressure to toe Beijing’s political line. The same evening that Mayday was playing in Beijing, Taiwanese pop queen Jolin Tsai proclaimed on stage that fans in “our Chinese city of Nanchang” were the most passionate, as she performed in the southern city. The phrase was taken by some Chinese fans as implying she and her audience were compatriots.
     
            Meanwhile on Weibo, China’s X-like platform, dozens of Taiwanese actors, musicians, and celebrities reposted a state media post championing Beijing’s claims of sovereignty over the island.
     
            “‘Taiwan independence’ is a dead end, and the reunification of the motherland is unstoppable!” broadcaster CCTV said in the post, which has been retweeted nearly 18 million times since it was published last Wednesday.
     
            On Douban, a popular site for reviewing movies, books and music, users compiled a list of nearly 100 Taiwanese celebrities, detailing whether each of them had shared the post.
     
            Despite her on-stage expression of kinship, some lashed out at Tsai for not reposting it. A comment with 14,000 upvotes called for authorities to suspend her concerts in China, because she “had never spoken out directly.”
     
            CNN has reached out to Tsai for comment.
     
            On Saturday, CCTV publicly endorsed Taiwanese celebrities who shared its post, sharing the screenshots of 36 such reposts – fueling a further backlash against those who hadn’t.
     
            “Those who didn’t endorse and take a stand, can you not come to the mainland to make money?” said a top comment with 55,000 upvotes.
     
            Lin Chen-yu, a lecturer at Cardiff University who specializes in China’s censorship of Taiwanese music, said acts such as Tsai and Mayday were facing problems because “both the government and private sectors are increasingly reacting to and engaging with digital nationalism.”
     
            And the marketing apparatus that can launch mainland careers is equally set up to avoid upsetting Beijing authorities.
     
            “For instance, management or touring contracts for activities in China increasingly include clauses that ban celebrities from making statements against the ideologies of the Chinese state,” she said. “This, of course, includes any pro-Taiwan statements.”
     
            Celebrities deemed as crossing Beijing’s political red lines are often blocked from the Chinese market, with their names and works erased from television and online platforms.
     
            “For example, musicians’ work can be easily removed from streaming platforms (in China), often automatically, if their names become keywords for censors on these platforms and media,” Lin said.
     
            Mayday appear to have avoided upsetting officials in China during their Beijing show, but many Taiwanese fans say they are deeply disappointed.
     
            A whole generation of Taiwanese people grew up listening to the band’s happy-go-lucky, pop-infused rock songs about the hope and heartbreak of youth, so much so that the 25-year-old band is sometimes dubbed the “Asian Beatles.”
 
            “As much as I used to like you, now I’m just as disappointed,” said a comment on Mayday’s Facebook page, after the Beijing concert.
     
            “I’m Taiwanese. Goodbye.” a fan said on Ashin’s Facebook page.
     
            CNN has reached out to Mayday’s record company B’in Music for comment.
     
            On Monday, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council weighed in, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of requiring Taiwanese artists to express a political stance.
     
            “Such political maneuvers will not win over the hearts and minds of Taiwanese people, and will only deepen Taiwanese society’s resentment towards the Chinese Communist regime,” the council said in a statement.
     
            The remarks and retweets by Taiwanese artists of the CCTV unification post came against the backdrop of China’s largest show of force around the island in more than a year. The Chinese military called the drills a “strong punishment” for Taiwan’s so-called “separatist acts” and said they were designed to test its ability to “seize power.”
     
            That military muscle-flex was sparked by the inauguration of Taiwan’s new President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island’s sovereignty and distinct identity.
     
            As the backlash mounted in Taiwan against the musicians, Lai struck a conciliatory tone.
     
            “This is not the first time, and probably not the last, that Taiwanese artists are forced to make a political stand in China,” said the leader.
     
            “Under the roof of others, it’s one thing what our artists say, but what’s more important is what they truly feel in their hearts. We should offer them understanding and empathy.”
     
            Beijing officials said the Taipei administration was wrong to say artists were being coerced.
     
            Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwanese celebrities who reposted the Weibo “reunification” message wanted “to express that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are both Chinese.”
     
            “These are natural expressions of true feelings,” Zhu said.
     
            Taiwanese acts in the Chinese market will continue to endure an invidious position, said Lin, of Cardiff University.
     
            “However, it is time for the industries in Taiwan to re-evaluate what this means for our society,” she said. “The circulation of these works comes with a price – a significant loss of freedom and autonomy.”

            China on Monday accused Britain of recruiting a married couple employed by the Chinese central government to spy for its MI6 intelligence service, as the two countries trade allegations of espionage.
     
            In a statement, China’s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), said it had recently cracked a “major espionage case” involving MI6, in which it uncovered two important moles “planted by the British side within our ranks.”
     
            The allegation comes just weeks after British police charged three people with spying for Hong Kong’s intelligence service, following charges laid in April against two other people accused of spying for China, including a former researcher for a prominent lawmaker in the ruling Conservative Party.
     
            Those charges in the United Kingdom came after China’s MSS said in January it had detained the head of a foreign consultancy who had allegedly spied for MI6.
     
            Under Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, the country’s notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit. From a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life.
     
            Over the last six months the MSS has made regular public declarations of dismantling foreign spying operations, claims which are impossible to verify given their nature but paint the agency in a positive light and provide regular reminders to Chinese citizens to be wary.
     
            In its latest statement Monday, the MSS detailed its allegations against the married couple.
     
            It said an alleged spy, identified by his surname Wang, was working at a position “with access to core confidential information” in an unnamed central state organ.
     
            In 2015, Wang’s application to study in the UK under an exchange program was “swiftly approved” because MI6 valued his access, according to the MSS.
     
            While studying in Britain, Wang was allegedly invited to meals and tours arranged by MI6 to understand his “character weaknesses and personal interests,” MSS said.
     
            After finding out Wang had “a strong desire for money,” the British spy agency used an alumnus to lure him into a part-time consulting opportunity with high remuneration, MSS said.

            “The British side started with open research projects and gradually moved into core internal matters of our central state agencies, paying him a fee significantly higher than normal consulting rates. Although Wang was somewhat wary of this, he continued to provide so-called ‘consulting’ services to the British side under the lure of large sums of money,” the MSS statement said.
     
            After a while, MI6 personnel approached Wang to work for the British government with promises of higher monetary rewards and security guarantees, the MSS alleged.
     
            Wang allegedly agreed to the terms and received espionage training before he was told to return to China to gather intelligence, the statement said.
     
            The MSS claimed MI6 also repeatedly urged Wang to persuade his wife – who worked at a “core” government agency – to join the espionage, offering to double the money. Despite his initial hesitation, Wang and his wife, surnamed Zhou, eventually agreed, MSS alleged.
     
            The case is under further investigation, according to MSS.
     
            CNN has asked for comment from Britain’s Foreign Office, which handles media enquiries for the Secret Intelligence Service, the official name for MI6.
     
            In August last year, the MSS made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China’s most popular social app, with a rallying call for “all members of society” to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets.
     
            According to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything – from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has previously posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by Western spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.

            Taiwan is pursuing independence incrementally and those who support it will “end up in self-destruction,” China’s new defense minister warned Sunday in a wide-ranging speech at a security summit in Singapore where the extent of regional tensions was on stark display.
     
            Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun made the comments in a roughly 30-minute speech which comes days after Beijing staged major military exercises encircling the island of Taiwan after it inaugurated its new, democratically elected president last month.
     
            “We will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds,” Dong said speaking through a translator, while slamming “external interfering forces” for selling arms and having “illegal official contacts” with Taiwan, in an apparent reference to the United States, which maintains close, unofficial ties with Taiwan.
     
            “China stays committed to peaceful reunification. However, this prospect is increasingly being eroded by separatists for Taiwan independence and foreign forces,” Dong warned.
     
            His comments come as there has been heightened concern in the region over Beijing’s military and economic intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
     
            In a meeting with Dong on Friday, US defense chief Lloyd Austin called on China not to “use Taiwan’s political transition — part of a normal, routine democratic process — as a pretext for coercive measures.”
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it and has vowed to “reunify” with it, by force if necessary. Taiwan’s new President Lai Ching-te and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), are both openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty.
     
            Lai has said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country” so there is “no plan or need” to declare independence. The US also by longstanding policy does not support Taiwan independence nor the unilateral change of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
     
            “The DPP authorities in Taiwan are pursuing separation in an incremental way. They are bent on erasing their Chinese identity of Taiwan and severing social, historical and cultural links across the Taiwan Strait,” Dong said, reiterating Beijing’s rhetoric that they would be “nailed to the pillar of shame in history.”
     
            Polls show growing numbers of the island’s people – especially young people – view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China, an authoritarian one-party state compared to Taiwan’s democracy. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese – while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese.
     
            Taiwan called Dong’s comments in Singapore “provocative and irrational.”
     
            “Any… coercive actions that disregard public opinion run contrary to democracy and human rights, or any resort to war will eventually be counterproductive,” Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement.
     
            Dong, a former naval commander, is making his debut at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit after being appointed to his position late last year following a surprise shake-up at the top of China’s Defense Ministry.
     
            The gathering plays out amid a contentious security landscape across the region, where China is widely seen by its neighbors as using its military might to assert disputed territorial claims and bid for military prominence in a part of the world where the US has deep security ties.
     
            Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented patrolling and making aggressive maneuvers against others operating in international waters and skies as it asserts disputed claims in the East and South China Seas.
     
            But Dong painted a different vision of China in his speech, framing it as a benign power whose military “never acts from the so-called position of strength,” while taking oblique aim at the US saying, “we will not allow anyone to bring geopolitical conflicts or any war, whether hot or cold to our region.”
     
            The Chinese defense chief also said there was a “limit to” China’s restraint when it comes to “provocations” in the South China Sea, making an apparent reference to US treaty ally the Philippines, which Dong did not name directly.
     
            A “certain country” was “emboldened” by outside powers and had “made mediated provocations,” Dong said, while indirectly referencing the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines in April.
     
            China has militarized islands in the disputed South China Sea, and in recent months its coast guard has fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas, further ratcheting tensions in the key strategic waterway.
     
            China claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim.
     
            Dong’s comments come after Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea at the opening of the same defense forum in Singapore. He also warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be “very close” to an act of war.
     
            The Chinese defense chief also pushed back against concerns voiced by the US that dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia’s defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine.
     
            “We have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual-use items and have never done anything to fan the flames,” Dong said.
     
            The issue was raised during a meeting between Dong and US counterpart Austin – the first face-to-face talks between US and Chinese defense since 2022, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily.
     
            Dong said China “stays open to exchanges and cooperation with the US military.”
     
            The annual security forum in Singapore – which is hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) – is a rare gathering of senior military officials from across the Asia-Pacific region, including those who are geopolitical rivals or view each other warily.
     
            It is also a rare opportunity to hear from, and pose questions to, senior Chinese military leaders.
     
            Many of the questions directed at Dong from delegates revolved around China’s increased assertiveness throughout the region, particularly towards Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.
     
            Robert Ward, IISS Japan chair, told CNN he felt Dong’s tone was “more shrill” than he’s seen in previous speeches by Chinese defense chiefs at the gathering.
     
            “The strategic environment in Asia has actually got more tense and I think we saw that in the Chinese defense minister’s speech today,” Ward said.
     
            “The tone was far harder this year than it was last year,” he added.
     
            Meanwhile a senior US official had the following assessment.
     
            “Every year for three years, a new Chinese defense minister has come to Shangri-La,” the official told CNN. “And every year, they’ve given a speech at complete odds with the reality of the PLA’s coercive activity across the region. This year was no different.”

            China’s Chang’e-6 lunar lander successfully touched down on the far side of the moon Sunday morning Beijing time, in a significant step for the ambitious mission that could advance the country’s aspirations of putting astronauts on the moon.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, where it will begin to collect samples from the lunar surface, the China National Space Administration announced.
     
            China’s most complex robotic lunar endeavor to date, the uncrewed mission aims to return samples to Earth from the moon’s far side for the first time.
     
            The landing marks the second time a mission has successfully reached the far side of the moon. China first completed that historic feat in 2019 with its Chang’e-4 probe.
     
            If all goes as planned, the mission — which began on May 3 and is expected to last 53 days — could be a key milestone in China’s push to become a dominant space power.
     
            The country’s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole – a region believed to contain water ice.
     
            Sunday’s landing comes as a growing number of countries, including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field.
     
            Samples collected by the Chang’e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say – while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China’s lunar ambitions.
     
            Chang’e-6 touched down within an impact crater known as the Apollo Basin, located within the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer-diameter South Pole-Aitken Basin, according to Chinese state media Xinhua. It had orbited the moon for about 20 days as part of a larger probe, which is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a re-entry module.
     
            It is now expected to use a drill and a mechanical arm to gather up to 2 kilograms of moon dust and rocks from the basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago.
     
            The probe will spend two days on the far side of the moon, and 14 hours to collect moon soil samples, Xinhua reported.
     
            To complete its mission, the lander will need to robotically stow those samples in an ascent vehicle that made the landing with it.
     
            The ascent vehicle will then return to lunar orbit, where it will dock with and transfer the samples to a re-entry capsule, according to mission information provided by the China National Space Administration.
     
            The re-entry capsule and orbiter will then travel back to Earth’s orbit and separate, allowing the re-entry capsule to make its expected return later this month to the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in China’s rural Inner Mongolia region.

            The technically complex mission is made more challenging due to where it is being conducted. The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang’e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2.
     
            China plans to launch two more missions in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon.
     
            Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration.
     
            Last year, India landed a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia’s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon’s surface.
     
            In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole.
     
            That landing – the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades – is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there as soon as 2026 and build its scientific base camp.

            The death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be “very close” to an act of war, Philippines President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. warned Friday as his nation faces increasingly fraught clashes with Chinese vessels in the South China Sea.
     
            Marcos delivered the keynote speech of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, a regional gathering of global security leaders, including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun.
     
            The Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a “red line” would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor.
     
            “If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,” he replied.
     
            “And our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,” he added.
     
            China has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.
     
            With confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty.
     
            As part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is “iron-clad” and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it.
     
            That raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally – and even drag the US military into a conflict.
     
            “We already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,” Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China’s coast guard ships.
     
            “But once we get to that point (a fatality)… we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,” he said.
     
            China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea – one of the world’s busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines.
     
            In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China’s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis.
     
            But Beijing has rejected the tribunal’s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China’s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels – which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors.
     
            Marcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech.
     
            “Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,” he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it’s sovereignty to “the last square millimeter.”
     
            “The life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,” he added.
     
            In the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone.
     
            Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA.
     
            A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are “in line with common international practices.”
     
            “As long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,” spokesperson Mao Ning said.
     
            “What I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,” Ning added.
     
            In his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region.
     
            “The strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. This contest is exacerbating flashpoints, it has created new security dilemmas,” Marcos told delegates.
     
            “The continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that rivalry in a responsible manner,” he added.

            US and Chinese defense chiefs held rare talks in Singapore Friday touching on a host of fractious issues including Taiwan and China’s relationship with Russia as well as frictions in the South China Sea as the two powers navigate a contentious security landscape across the Asia-Pacific.
     
            The meeting, between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China’s Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun, is the first face-to-face talks between the two defense chiefs and Austin’s first such discussions with a Chinese counterpart since late 2022.
     
            The meeting, on the sidelines of an annual defense conference in Singapore, takes place against a fraught regional backdrop. Beijing – which wields the world’s largest navy – continues to aggressively assert disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, while decrying Washington’s efforts to strengthen security ties with key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.
     
            At the core of those contentions is that China does not want to see America exercise its military power in Asia – a region where the US it has deep, historic security ties and seeks to maintain open waterways and deter North Korean aggression, but where China is widely viewed as wanting to establish its dominance.
     
            A deterioration of US-China military dialogue in recent years raised international concerns about those tensions leading to miscommunications that could veer toward conflict.
     
            In their roughly 75 minute meeting, both Austin and Dong nodded to their interests in maintaining dialogue, while also pressing each other on key issues, according to statements from each sides.
     
            Austin raised concerns about “recent provocative” Chinese military activity around the Taiwan Strait and China’s “role in supporting Russia’s defense industrial base,” according to a readout from Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.
     
            The US defense chief also “made clear” that the US would continue its operations “safely and responsibly” wherever international law allows – in an apparent pushback on China’s aggressive patrolling of international waters and airspace in the region.
     
            Austin’s counterpart said the “stabilization” of the military-to-military relations “does not come by easily and shall be cherished dearly,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian, told reporters after the meeting, adding that Dong stressed that neither side should “contain or smear” the other side, but build mutual trust.
     
            Dong also said that when it comes to areas surrounding China, especially the South China Sea, commercial ships and aircraft “can always operate safely,” but that “there is a huge difference between freedom and willfulness, between navigation and trespassing.”
     
            “It is important to respect others’ security concerns, and security should be mutually respected. No one can pursue one’s security at the expense of another country’s security,” Dong said, according to the ministry spokesperson.
     
            The two leaders spoke following a period of weeks where regional tensions have been on show.
     
            China earlier this month staged major war games around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island’s new democratically elected president Lai Ching-te. China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it.
     
            Its Coast Guard in recent weeks has also fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stoking already heightened tensions with a US treaty ally in the region.
     
            Beijing has also lashed out at what it sees as provocative moves between the US and its allies, as it conducts joint military exercises in the region.

            Austin in his talks with Dong reiterated the US call for China not to “use Taiwan’s political transition—part of a normal, routine democratic process—as a pretext for coercive measures,” the Pentagon statement said. Dong, meanwhile, slammed the US for offering a congratulatory message for Lai, calling on it to take “concrete actions to correct its mistakes,” according to China’s account.
     
            Dong also condemned the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines last month as a “threat to regional security,” and accused Manila of being “emboldened by outside powers,” according to Wu. “Our tolerance for continued and intensified provocations will have a limit,” the spokesperson quoted Dong as saying in reference to the Philippines.
     
            China claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim.
     
            The two sides also discussed Russia’s war in Ukraine, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting.
     
            The US defense chief “said quite clearly that if China’s support for Russia’s defense sector continues than the United States, with our allies, will have to take further measures,” the official said, while declining to detail what those measures would be.
     
            Washington in recent weeks has said dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia’s defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine and have warned Chinese counterparts against providing lethal aid. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had “honored our promise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict” and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China’s spokesperson.
     
            Austin also discussed US concerns about China’s nuclear buildup and cyber attacks on US critical infrastructure, a second US defense official said.
     
            The sit-down in Singapore follows a call last month between Austin and Dong, who was appointed to his post in late December. The call marked Austin’s first at-length conversation with a Chinese counterpart since November 2022.
     
            Beijing had largely suspended high-level military communications following a visit in August of that year from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which sparked Beijing’s ire.
     
            The silence coincided with a period of significant tensions between the two powers, which included high-profile incidents such as a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the continental US and what the US described as an increase in “coercive and risky” behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft over the East and South China Seas.

            US efforts to re-engage appeared further complicated by the appointment in early 2023 of China’s previous Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who had been sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China’s purchase of Russian weapons.
     
            Austin and Li had a brief exchange during last year’s Shangri-La Dialogue, but no formal talks, with Beijing repeatedly suggesting that the US defense secretary won’t get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked.
     
            Efforts to stabilize that communication hit another complication after Li abruptly vanished from the public eye last August amid a personnel shake-up in Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s military ranks.
     
            Li was formally removed from his post without explanation in October and replaced by Dong, a former naval commander, some two months later.  In China, the defense minister is a largely ceremonial role, serving as the public face of military diplomacy with other countries, while command power resides within the Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Central Military Commission led by Xi.
     
            Xi and US President Joe Biden had vowed to restore high-level military talks during a summit outside San Francisco in November, seen by both sides as a key step in stabilizing fractious relations.
     
            Several weeks later, US and Chinese top generals spoke in a video call, paving the way for this week’s in-person meeting between the defense chiefs.
     
            Following Friday’s meeting, a US defense official said the US side had pressed for calls between China’s five theater commanders in the region and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo, adding that those calls could happen soon but had not been scheduled.
     
            Austin also referenced plans to convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year, the Pentagon readout said.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping decried “tremendous sufferings” in the Middle East and called for an international peace conference as leaders from Arab nations visit Beijing this week amid mounting global concern over Israel’s war in Gaza.
     
            “Since last October, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has escalated drastically, throwing the people into tremendous sufferings. War should not continue indefinitely. Justice should not be absent forever,” Xi said Thursday at the opening of a meeting between top diplomats from China and Arab states, also attended by several leaders from the region.
     
            He also reiterated China’s call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, as well as Beijing’s support for a “more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference.”
     
            The diplomatic gatherings in Beijing come as Israel’s war in Gaza remains an urgent global focus, as Israeli forces intensify operations in the enclave’s southern city of Rafah and a humanitarian crisis worsens by the day. Delegations from 22 Arab states met at Beijing’s Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Later Thursday, Chinese and Arab-nation ministers adopted a strident joint statement condemning Israel’s “aggression against the Palestinian people” and in Rafah, according to the document as published by Chinese state media Friday.
     
            The statement – which adopted some of China’s most pointed language to date on the conflict – decried what it described as a “deadly famine and blockade that has cut off all livelihoods” and “systematic” destruction of residential areas, hospitals, schools, mosques, churches and infrastructure in Gaza.
     
            Israel has repeatedly defended its operations in the enclave as necessary to eradicate the militant group Hamas.
     
China, which has sought to deepen its relations across the Middle East in recent years, has positioned itself in alignment with the Arab world and the broader Global South on the nearly eight-month-long conflict, criticizing Israel and calling for a ceasefire.
     
            Its stance has put it at odds with the United States, long a key power in the region and a primary backer of Israel. Chinese officials have used the conflict to hit out at Washington – fitting into a larger message from Beijing that frames the US as an aggressor unfairly dominating the current world order.
     
            Xi in his remarks hailed a “common desire for a new era of China-Arab relations” and said their relations could be a “model for maintaining world peace and stability.”
     
            “In this turbulent world, peaceful relations come from mutual respect, and lasting security is built on fairness and justice,” said the Chinese leader, who has pushed for an alternative model for global security to the alliance-based one backed by the US.
     
            Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, United Arab Emirates President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and Tunisian President Kais Saied are in China for state visits that coincide with the ministerial meeting.
     
            Following the gathering, Wang told reporters the “strongest call of the meeting was one to firmly support the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights.”
     
            “The joint statement puts forward a just voice to promote the speedy resolution of the Gaza conflict and the comprehensive, fair and lasting resolution of the Palestinian issue,” Wang said, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Israel declared war on Hamas in Gaza following the militant group’s October 7 attack on its territory that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 200 taken hostage, according to Israeli forces. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of Israeli military operations in Gaza, according to its health ministry.
     
            Since the start of the war, Beijing has positioned itself as a champion for the broader issue of a two-state solution, which would see the international recognition of a Palestinian state. The stance is in line with the country’s recognition of the Palestinian state in 1988.
     
            China has also dispatched rounds of envoys to the region to meet Arab counterparts and supported calls for a ceasefire in the United Nations. It has not explicitly condemned Hamas for the October 7 attacks.
     
            Beijing last month hosted representatives from rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas for “reconciliation” talks.
     
            In Thursday’s joint statement, China and its Arab-nation counterparts also called for the “end of the occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine” and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. It also condemned the US for using its United Nations Security Council veto to block a resolution that would have recommended granting full Palestinian UN membership.
     
            With its diplomacy this week, China “wants to demonstrate leadership, consolidate ties, and call for ceasefire (in Gaza). It wants to be a particularly strong leader on this issue, at least rhetorically,” according to Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, speaking ahead of the meeting.
     
            “China has chosen to side with Palestine and the Arab countries. The choice is deliberate as it does suggest a desire to align with Arab countries, and the Global South. But China didn’t create the crisis. It only capitalized on it,” she added.

China notes Iran’s position on Israel attack and does not condemn strikes
 
            Even as Beijing has sought to tighten ties throughout the Middle East in recent years, observers say its influence in the region remains limited.
     
            Beijing has also appeared unwilling to take certain steps to respond to regional effects of the conflict. For example, it said it did not deploy additional naval assets to secure Red Sea shipping lanes that were under attack in recent months by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.
     
            Xi during his opening remarks pledged China will provide an additional nearly $70 million to alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to supporting post-conflict reconstruction, adding to roughly $14 million already contributed, as well as $3 million to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in support of its emergency humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
     
            Thursday’s ministerial meeting is the first such gathering since China held its first joint summit with Arab leaders in late 2022 in Saudi Arabia.
     
            Then, Xi was welcomed to the Gulf state with fanfare – cutting a sharp contrast to a tense visit from US President Joe Biden earlier that year amid American outrage over Riyadh’s alleged role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul.
     
            Xi and other top Chinese officials also held bilateral talks with visiting leaders this week, and announced that China would hold the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026.

China Coast Guard ships have been in waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea for a record 158 consecutive days, according to Tokyo’s latest count released Monday, surpassing the previous record set in 2021.
     
            Analysts fear the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, have the potential to become a flashpoint for conflict between the two Asian neighbors.
     
            “The Japanese government takes very seriously the fact that there have been a succession of vessels sailing in the contiguous zone and trespassing in territorial waters,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a Monday briefing in Tokyo.
     
            The Japanese government’s chief spokesperson did not say how often Chinese ships entered Japan’s territorial waters, though foreign ships are allowed “innocent passage” through such waters.
     
            A contiguous zone extends another 12 nautical miles beyond a country’s territorial waters, the area that stretches 12 nautical miles from the shore.
     
            Foreign warships are allowed into contiguous zone waters – so the Chinese Coast Guard hasn’t broken any international agreements – but the continuous presence of the Chinese vessels there is seen as a provocation.
     
            Hayashi said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has raised Tokyo’s “serious concerns” with Chinese Premier Li Qiang during a trilateral summit with South Korea in Seoul on Monday.
     
            “We will continue to take every possible precaution and surveillance around the Senkaku Islands with a sense of urgency,” he said.
     
            The uninhabited island chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years.
     
            Claims over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China’s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals.
     
            Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims.
     
            It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims.
     
            “Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China’s inherent territory,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said. “It is legal and reasonable for our Coast Guard to conduct normal patrols in waters administered by China.”
     
            Experts have said China makes a statement and sets up a possible legal argument for sovereignty over the islands by keeping government ships near them.

            To present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, “China simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,” James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, told CNN in 2022.
     
            Hayashi, the Japanese government spokesperson, said Monday that Tokyo is answering the Chinese presence around the islands with vessels of its own.
     
            “We ensure a comprehensive security system for territorial waters by deploying Coast Guard patrol vessels that are consistently superior to other party’s capacity,” Hayashi said.
     
            Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan’s mutual defense treaty with the United States.
     
            Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the pact.
     
            The extended Chinese presence around the Senkakus comes as Chinese forces assert themselves in two other East Asian hotspots – around Taiwan and near Philippines-controlled features in the South China Sea.
     
            China staged its largest military exercises this year around Taiwan last week after the island’s new democratically elected leader, President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island’s sovereignty and distinct identity, was sworn in.

            China’s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.
     
            And in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has been taking action against Philippine vessels trying to resupply a contingent of Philippine marines on Second Thomas Shoal, using water cannons that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged their craft.
     
            The developments come as leaders and military officials prepare to gather in Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier defense summit.
     
            Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to give the keynote speech Friday evening, with Chinese-Philippine clashes around Second Thomas Shoal expected to be a prime topic.
     
            The US and Chinese defense chiefs are also expected to address the conference.

            The most important carmaker in the world right now is the Chinese-owned, Warren Buffett-backed company that has Elon Musk in a pickle.
     
            BYD, a carmaker Musk once laughed at, overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the top seller of electric vehicles on the planet (Tesla overtook it in the first quarter of this year, but they’re neck and neck). And now it’s giving Toyota a run for its money, unveiling a new hybrid powertrain that BYD says is capable of taking you from New York to Miami without refueling.
     
            That’s 1,300 miles in one go — hundreds of miles beyond the standard ranges for other hybrids on the market. According to The Wall Street Journal, ranges of major global hybrid carmakers typically top out just above 680 miles.
     
            BYD’s Hong Kong shares shot up more than 5% on Wednesday.
     
            There are a few reasons why all of that matters.
     
            One: Tesla is America’s best-selling EV, but it’s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn’t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point.
     
            That’s why BYD — which makes both EVs and hybrids — is now eating Tesla’s lunch on the global stage.
     
            China is the world’s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year.
     
            On top of all that, BYD’s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.)
     
            BYD’s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview.
     
Related article
How EVs became such a massive disappointment
 
            In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh.
     
            “Have you seen their car?” he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD’s product is not “particularly attractive” and that the technology is “not very strong.”
     
            Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could “pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world” unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.)
     
            Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids.
     
            Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation’s roads lack the infrastructure to support them.
     
            EV ranges have come a long way — most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don’t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea.
     
            The top reason US customers won’t consider an EV — cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey — is lack of charging station availability.
     
            Instead, we’re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly… Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they’re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.)
     
            For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it’s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.

            China plans to invest around 6 billion yuan ($845 million) to develop  next-generation battery technology powering electrical vehicles (EVs), even as its industrial policy has sparked overcapacity concerns and become a key target of US and European complaints.
     
            A total of six companies — including CATL, the world’s biggest battery manufacturer, and major automakers like BYD and Geely — are eligible for government support to develop all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), the official China Daily newspaper reported Wednesday, citing unnamed industrial sources.
     
            The “unprecedented” project will be led by the relevant government ministries and commissions, it said, without giving details.
     
            ASSBs are a new technology that improves on traditional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using a solid, conductive electrolyte instead of liquid or gel-form material. They are less likely to catch fire or explode than conventional batteries and have higher energy density, so they are believed to be safer and more powerful.
     
            However, the powerful batteries are not widely available at the moment due to their high cost and difficulty in being mass produced.
     
            The news of Beijing’s intended investment comes at a fraught time for China’s trade relations with the West.
     
            Earlier this month, the Biden administration imposed major new tariffs on Chinese EVs, advanced batteries and other goods. American officials say they want to protect US jobs and businesses from problems posed by the overproduction of certain products in the world’s second largest economy.

Germany says Europe is open to Chinese cars but not at any price
 
            The European Commission is set to announce early next month its own decision on Chinese EV tariffs, which could spell trouble for Chinese EV makers that export hundreds of thousands of cars to Europe every year.
     
            But Beijing is still ramping up efforts to accelerate EV production as it tries to counter a property-induced economic slowdown and promote a low-carbon economy.
     
            Global automakers and tech companies are also working on ASSBs.
     
            In January, Toyota (TM) said it would launch vehicles with solid-state batteries in a few years, according to Reuters. Samsung SDI said in March that it would begin mass producing solid-state batteries in 2027. Volkswagen has also been trying to develop the batteries with US startup Quantum Scape.
     
            Chinese rivals are also upping the ante. GAC Group, a state-owned automaker based in Guangzhou, said in November that it had achieved a breakthrough in solid-state batteries and would roll out vehicles with them in 2026.

            China has lifted bans on imports from five major Australian beef processing facilities, the Australian government said on Thursday, in the latest sign of improving relations between the two nations.
     
            Beijing has now removed restrictions from eight abattoirs but two remain subject to import bans, the government said.
     
            China imposed the bans between 2020 and 2022, around the same time it barred imports of a swathe of commodities including coal, timber and wine from Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origin of COVID-19.
     
            The bans applied to certain abattoirs but did not affect others, which meant Australia was still able to ship beef to China.
     
            “It was difficult for those particular abattoirs but we still saw beef flowing,” said Matt Dalgleish, an analyst at agricultural consultants Episode 3.
     
            He said the removal of the restrictions should still boost Australian shipments to China, which have already risen to their highest level since 2020 as a shrinking cattle herd in the United States, Australia’s main competitor, reduces US exports.
     
            Lower US supply may have been one reason for China’s action, Dalgleish said.
     
            China was Australia’s second-biggest beef export market last year, receiving 240,000 tons worth around $1.6 billion, Australian trade data shows.
     
            Beijing has lifted most of the barriers it imposed on Australian goods since a change of government in Canberra two years ago. A ban on imports of Australian lobsters remains in place.
     
            “We continue to press China to remove the remaining trade impediments, including for Australia’s rock lobster industry,” Australian foreign minister Penny Wong, trade minister Don Farrell and agriculture minister Murray Watt said in a joint statement.
     
            They said China’s trade impediments at their height impacted Australian exports worth 20.6 billion Australian dollars ($13.6 billion).
     
            The reasons China gave for suspending the Australian beef processors were issues over labeling or contamination or cases of COVID-19 among their workers.

            A rebound in Apple’s iPhone sales in China is gaining momentum, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market to lure back consumers actively hunting bargains in a weak economy.
     
            Shipments of foreign-branded cell phones in China, the vast majority of which are iPhones, surged 52% in April to 3.489 million units, according to CNN calculations based on data released Tuesday by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). The academy is a research firm under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a regulatory body.
     
            The increase is a major acceleration from the 12% growth logged in March by foreign-branded smartphones, according to previous data from CAICT.
     
            The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid known for its patriotic views and promoting Chinese companies, has described the rebound as “impressive.”
     
            Apple (AAPL) had a tough start to 2024 in China.
     
            In the first quarter, it lost the top spot in the country’s smartphone market as shipments tumbled 19%, according to a report by Counterpoint Research. Apple took a hit from growing competition with local brands including Huawei, which saw sales increase nearly 70% in the same period because of the successful launch of its Mate 60 series.

            An economic slump, including worsening job and income prospects, has prompted Chinese consumers to tighten their belts and seek discounts on everything from food to cars.
     
            But iPhone sales started to bounce back in March after Apple and its retail partners slashed prices, according to CAICT data.
     
            The price-cutting intensified recently. Last week, Apple said it would slash prices on some of its smartphones on Tmall, an Amazon-like site owned by Alibaba (BABA), by as much as 23% until May 28. Similar reductions were made on JD.com, another major e-commerce site.
     
            The unprecedented discounts were part of a campaign launched during the annual “618” shopping festival, China’s second-biggest online shopping bonanza of the year, which usually runs from late May to mid-June.
     
            After the discounts, the iPhone 15 is now in the same price range as smartphones made by Xiaomi and Huawei.
     
            The hefty reductions are “the only way” for Apple to defend its market share in China, Jefferies analysts said earlier this week.
     
            “We believe Apple has created significant pricing pressure on the local brands,” especially Huawei’s flagship models, they said.
     
            That will help Apple regain its lost market share but is also likely to put pressure on its competitors to cut prices further.
     
            “The discounts on high-end models could extend into the third quarter of 2024, pressuring all smartphone (makers’) margins,” they added.

            China is doubling down on its plan to dominate advanced technologies of the future by setting up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund, according to information posted by a government-run agency.
     
            Worth $47.5 billion, the fund is being created as the US imposes sweeping restrictions on the export of American chips and chip technology in a bid to throttle Beijing’s ambitions.
 
            With investments from six of the country’s largest state-owned banks, including ICBC and China Construction Bank, the fund underscores Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s push to bolster China’s position as a tech superpower.
     
            With its Made in China 2025 road map, Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G wireless, and quantum computing.
     
            The latest investment vehicle is the third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. The “Big Fund,” as it is known, was officially established in Beijing on Friday, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.
     
            Shares of top Chinese chipmakers have jumped after the news. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), the world’s third largest contract chipmaker, has rallied 7% since Monday. Hua Hong Semiconductor, China’s second largest chip foundry and a supplier for Huawei, has gained 13%.
     
            The first phase of the fund was set up in 2014 with 138.7 billion yuan ($19.2 billion). The second phase was established five years later, with a registered capital of 204.1 billion yuan ($28.2 billion).

            The investments aim to bring the country’s semiconductor industry up to international standards by 2030 and will pump money primarily into chip manufacturing, design, equipment and materials, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said when launching the first phase in 2014.
     
            The “Big Fund” has been hit by corruption scandals in recent years. In 2022, the country’s anti-graft watchdog launched a crackdown on the semiconductor industry, investigating some of China’s top figures in state-owned chip companies. Lu Jun, former chief executive of Sino IC Capital, which managed the “Big Fund,” was probed and indicted on bribery charges in March, according to a statement by the country’s top prosecutor.
 
            These scandals aren’t the only roadblocks that could severely undermined Xi’s ambitions to get China to achieve tech self-reliance.
     
            In October 2022, the US unveiled a sweeping set of export controls that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license. The Biden administration has also pressed its allies, including Netherlands and Japan, to enact their own restrictions.
     
            Beijing hit back last year by imposing export controls on two strategic raw materials that are critical to the global chipmaking industry.
     
            The new chip fund is not only a defensive move to counter Western sanctions, but also part of Xi’s long-held ambitions to make China a global leader in technology.
     
Last year, China’s Huawei shocked industry experts by introducing a new smartphone powered by a 7-nanometer processor made by SMIC.
     
            At the time of the Huawei phone launch, analysts could not understand how the company would have the technology to make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign technology.
     
            In a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in March, Xi said that “no force can stop China’s scientific and technological development.”
 
            The Netherlands is home to ASML, the world’s sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors. The company said in January that it had been prohibited by the Dutch government from shipping some of its lithography machines to China.

    Editor’s Note: Jonathan Chatwin is the author of “Long Peace Street: A Walk in Modern China” and “The Southern Tour: Deng Xiaoping and the Fight for China’s Future.” 
 
            Above Beijing’s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself.
     
            To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen — the Gate of Heavenly Peace — and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city’s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing’s central axis — its so-called dragon’s vein — sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city’s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors.
     
            It’s this aerial view of “Zhongnanhai,” meaning “middle and southern seas,” and the surrounding buildings that today’s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That’s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950.
     
            As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China’s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China’s communist party elite, and among the country’s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it — and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform.
     
            For Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area’s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden.
     
            A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barmé in his book “The Forbidden City” tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor’s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens’ Studio of Convivial Delight, a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of 18 dishes.
     
            As the historian and author of “The Shortest History of China,” Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: “There is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).”
     
            The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens’ Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908.
     
            The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake.

            Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor’s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself.
     
            His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of “The Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China’s Capital Through the Ages,” perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. “In addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,” he told CNN, “it also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.”
 
            For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People’s Republic. “As a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,” Aldrich said.
     
            There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China’s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City — and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration’s headquarters.
     
            The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. “Whatever may be one’s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai ‘exalted his aim’ in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,” wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book “In Search of Old Peking,” “for all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.”
     
            Most notable of these changes — at least to ordinary Beijingers — was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home.
     
            Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing’s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold.
     
            The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China’s political and party headquarters: “Long Live the Great Communist Party of China” reads one; and “Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought” on the other.
     
            On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao’s own calligraphic style declare: “Serve the People.” Facing out onto Beijing’s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public.
     
            Initially, after the communist victory in China’s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing — it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow — Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the Garden of Abundant Beneficence, a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries and live until 1966.
     
            Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes.
     
            “Since 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,” said Aldrich.
     
            In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water — and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit.
     
            “Their interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,” said Jaivin. “The Russian couldn’t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.”
     
            In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. “It was here,” noted Aldrich, “with the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.”
     
            Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the “Northern Sea” of central Beijing’s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the “back garden” of Chinese politics, out to the city’s west.
 
            Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. “In his memoirs, Chairman Mao’s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex’s) residents were always under surveillance,” Aldrich said. “During the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.”
     
            The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai’s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation — the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the “middle lake,” used as the headquarters of China’s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the “southern lake,” meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi).
     
            Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building’s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms.
     
            The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China’s Politburo, the party’s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo’s Standing Committee, the core of China’s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary’s office.
     
            During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four — the political faction that included Mao’s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era — were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao’s Selected Works.
     
            In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year.
     
            However, the compound hasn’t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China’s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including Mao’s former residence, on organized weekend tours. Even early in 1989, a journalist for the New York Times was able to casually drive a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside. During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president Hu Jintao invited a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai.
     
            Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound’s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in 1973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see – and potentially target a sniper rifle – into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view.
     
            Likewise in 2018, when Beijing’s new tallest building was completed – the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the “Zun” – the country’s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the security situation at the time.
     
            Zhongnanhai’s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government.
     
            So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: “Since ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a ‘New Forbidden City’ for China’s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,” he said. “Heck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!”

            China’s military drills around Taiwan are designed to test its ability to “seize power” over the island, the People’s Liberation Army said Friday as its forces kicked off a second day of large-scale exercises encircling its democratic neighbor.
     
            The drills are the largest in more than a year and come just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island’s sovereignty and distinct identity.
     
            Beijing has denounced Lai as a “dangerous separatist” and decried his inauguration speech on Monday, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown much more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
     
            The PLA, which dwarfs Taipei’s outgunned military, kicked off the exercises on Thursday morning, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in what it called “a strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.”
     
            On Friday, the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to “test the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.”
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary.
     
            The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in a generation, has made clear the island’s “inevitable reunification” with the mainland cannot be put off indefinitely.
     
            The two-day exercises, involving joint operations of China’s army, navy, air force and rocket force, are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait – a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China – as well as north, south and east of Taiwan, according to the PLA.
     
            For the first time, the PLA drills also involved China’s Coast Guard, operating in areas around Taiwan’s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off the southeastern coast of China.
     
            CCTV aired footage on Friday that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire.
     
            Taiwan’s Defense Ministry has condemned China’s military exercises as “irrational provocations” and dispatched its own sea, air and ground forces in response.
     
            Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, including 35 that crossed the Median Line, an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected.
     
            A total of 19 Chinese warships and seven coast guard vessels were detected near the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry.
     
            Taiwan’s presidential office said Thursday it is “regrettable to see China threatening Taiwan’s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations,” adding Taiwan has the “confidence and ability to protect national security.”
     
            Lai has had a busy and politically turbulent start to his presidency after taking over from two-term leader Tsai Ing-wen, to kick off a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
     
            The PLA’s drills pose the first real test for the veteran politician in managing tensions with Beijing, which has refused his offer to talk and to resume cross-strait tourism and student exchanges.
     
            On Friday, China’s Defense Ministry accused Lai of pushing Taiwan into “a dangerous situation of war”and “playing with fire.”
     
            “Those who play with fire will burn themselves,” ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters, using rhetoric China frequently deploys for Taiwan’s government. “Whenever ‘Taiwan independence’ (forces) provoke us, we will push our countermeasures forward until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.”
     
            Domestically, Lai is facing chaos in the legislature, where opposition parties who favor closer ties to China hold a majority, and have pushed to subject his administration to tighter scrutiny.
     
            Thousands of mostly young people have taken to the streets to protest the opposition’s attempt to fast-track the proposed bills to grant the parliament more power.
     
            But despite Beijing’s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China’s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years.
     
            “We are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,” an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN.
     
            “If the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won’t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.”
     
            A 42-year-old mother, who gave her surname Tsai, said she wasn’t even aware the PLA drills were taking place.
     
            “I believe leaders will prioritize people’s happiness, so I’m not worried. I think peace will be maintained,” she said.
     
            China’s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally, and state media has ramped up coverage of the drills.
     
            Zhang Chi, a Chinese military expert, told China’s state broadcaster CCTV that the PLA’s exercises focused on “practicing a new mode of blockading Taiwan.”
     
            “Taiwan is an isolated island, suspended in the sea with weak self-sufficiency. Taiwan’s economy is export-oriented, and most of its energy consumption relies on imports. Once besieged and blockaded, it can easily lead to economic collapse, turning it into a dead island,” he said.
     
            The exercises to the south of Taiwan are crucial for the blockade, targeting Kaohsiung port, Taiwan’s largest port and an important base for the island’s navy, Zhang said. Meanwhile, drills to the east of Taiwan are designed to practice cutting off the island’s energy imports, the escape routes for “Taiwan independence” forces and the support line from the US and its allies, he added.
     
            The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself.
     
            Zhang also noted that the drills had achieved “a new breakthrough” by entering waters near Wuqiu and Dongyin, which hold significant geographical importance.
     
            “The Taiwanese military views them as the front outposts for Taiwan Strait defense operations. This exercise further squeezed the activity space of the Taiwanese military,” he said.
     
            Analysts said the China Coast Guard movement close to and around the outlying islands was an important new aspect of the current drills, which follow previous encirclement exercises in August 2022 and April 2023.
     
            “The pressing of Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to those offshore islands is provocative,” said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
     
            He said he expected such Chinese activities to continue and that they “will become the norm,” with Beijing at any point able to then turn an exercise into a real military operation.
     
            Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China’s pattern of exercises around Taiwan does not signal an imminent invasion threat.
     
            “These drills aid in blurring the lines between peace and war, so much so that future exercises could be used as a pretext for an actual invasion,” Singleton said.
     
            But Singleton and others say the exercises are sending a bigger political message than a military one.
     
            “Joint Sword - 2024A aims at reactivating the military pressure lever to assert a degree of influence on the new (Taiwan) administration and its narrative,” said Lionel Fatton, assistant professor of international relations at Webster University in Geneva, using China’s name for this week’s drills.
     
            Beijing will use the pressure of the drills to try to increase divisions within Taiwan, which could “weaken” the island from the inside, he said.
     
            “Constant and visible military pressure on the island will also help polarize the political apparatus, if not the social fabric itself,” Fatton said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,China has launched new drills encircling Taiwan. Why now?,"Tensions are once again ratcheting up in the Taiwan Strait, with China launching military drills encircling Taiwan just days after the democracy swore in a new leader long loathed by Beijing.","May 24, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Jessie Yeung,China,"
            Tensions are once again ratcheting up in the Taiwan Strait, with China launching two days of military drills encircling Taiwan just days after the democracy swore in a new leader long loathed by Beijing.
     
            The exercises began early Thursday, in what China described as “punishment” for “separatist acts” – alluding to the election and inauguration of the self-governing island’s new President Lai Ching-te.
 
            China’s military says the drills are designed to test its ability to “seize power” over Taiwan.
     
            Though relations between the two sides have been steadily worsening in recent years, this latest escalation marks a significant test for Taiwan’s new leader, whose ruling party has championed democracy in the face of growing threats from its authoritarian neighbor.
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. And it has become much more bellicose under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
     
            Here’s what you need to know.
     
            The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan early Thursday morning.
     
            The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait – a narrow body of water separating the self-ruling island from mainland China – as well as north, south and east of Taiwan.
     
            They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan’s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China’s southeastern coast, the command said in a statement.
     
            Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises “a strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.”
     
            As part of the drills on Thursday, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against “high-value military targets” of the “enemy” alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China’s state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            On Friday, the Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to “test the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.” CCTV aired footage that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire.
     
            China’s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. Chinese state media heavily covered the drills while the military also posted footage on social media. The exercises subsequently went viral on China’s heavily regulated internet.
     
            Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces to respond to China’s drills. It expressed regret at “such irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.”
     
            Taiwan has also been closely monitoring China’s warplanes and naval ships that came close to the island. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, 19 warships and seven coast guard vessels.
     
            The island’s presidential office said in a statement that it was “confident and capable of defending national security,” accusing China of “using unilateral military provocation to threaten Taiwan’s democracy and freedom.”
     
            But despite Beijing’s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China’s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years.
     
            “We are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,” an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN.
     
            “If the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won’t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.”
     
            The most obvious answer is Lai’s inauguration on Monday.
     
            Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now in power for a historic third term, views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation with a distinct Taiwanese identity.
     
            Ahead of Taiwan’s elections back in January, Beijing had warned that a Lai victory could inflame tensions and spark conflict – repeatedly framing the vote as a choice between “peace and war.”
     
            Taiwanese voters dismissed those warnings, returning the DPP to power – although two opposition parties that favor closer ties with China now have a majority in parliament.
     
            China’s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, “troublemaker” and “war maker,” while rejecting his repeated offers of talks.
     
            Their vehement dislike of Lai is rooted in his political past, as well as Beijing’s refusal to deal directly with a huge swathe of Taiwan’s leaders.
     
            The 64-year-old former doctor and political veteran was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence – a red line for Beijing.
     
            His views have tempered over the years, and he now says he favors the status quo, saying there is “no plan or need” to declare independence since the island is “already an independent sovereign country.”
     
            But Beijing has never forgiven him for those early comments – making its stance clear with the drills on Thursday.
     
            Lai, too, has set the tone for his new administration’s approach to China – using his inaugural speech on Monday to declare that a “glorious era of Taiwan’s democracy has arrived,” and reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty.
     
            He also called on Beijing to cease its “intimidation” of Taiwan and respect that its people want to decide their own destiny.
     
            The Chinese Civil War ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in the mainland, establishing the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing in 1949.
     
            The defeated Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of their Republic of China (ROC) government from the mainland to Taipei.
     
            Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory.
     
            In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government.

            But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world. Over the decades it has become increasingly isolated, with a number of governments switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. But unofficial diplomatic ties with many Western nations have in fact been bolstered in recent years, in part thanks to China’s saber-rattling.
     
            Meanwhile, under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home.
     
            China has cut official communication with Taiwan since the DPP took office in 2016, and has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island.
     
            At the same time, ties between Taipei and Washington have become more robust, with increased arms sales and high-level political engagement under Lai’s popular predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral.
     
            The US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 – but has long trod a delicate middle path.
     
            In what is known as the “One China” policy, Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the Chinese Communist Party’s claim of sovereignty over the island.
     
            The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, which have been strengthened in recent years. It is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and supplies it with defensive weaponry.
     
            American lawmakers regularly visit Taiwan and have supported legislation to bolster US support for the island and its defensive capabilities.
     
            But it has historically remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”
     
            After the election in January, the US sent a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan, where they met with Lai and Tsai – and promised that American support for Taiwan will continue no matter who wins the upcoming US election.
     
            Beijing on Tuesday also announced sanctions against former US House Representative Mike Gallagher, who led that delegation, citing his “remarks and actions” that “interfere” in China’s internal affairs.

            When Kenyan President William Ruto touched down in Beijing seven months ago, he was welcomed on the tarmac with a red carpet and cordons of Chinese troops standing at attention. Among the goals of his three-day state visit in October: securing another $1 billion in loans from China to help complete infrastructure projects.
     
            On Wednesday, when he arrived at Joint Base Andrews to begin another state visit – this time to Washington – he again found a red carpet and troops. This time, however, a special emissary was sent to greet his plane: first lady Dr. Jill Biden.
     
            President Joe Biden is leaning on the highest trappings of American diplomacy this week to boost ties with the East African nation, including designating Kenya a major non-NATO ally – the first in sub-Saharan Africa – and hosting a sunset state dinner on the White House South Lawn.
     
            Biden offered effusive praise for his Kenyan counterpart, including for Kenya’s leadership on “a historic African green industrialization initiative” as he welcomed Ruto to the White House for the visit.
     
            “Together, the United States and Kenya are working to deliver on the challenges that matter most to our people’s’ lives – health security, economic security, cybersecurity, and climate security,” he said. “Mr. President, your bold leadership on this front has been important and particularly impactful.”
     
            Looming over the pomp and circumstance is China’s expanding role in Africa, which has become a central testing ground for the world’s two largest economies as they jockey for economic and geopolitical influence.
     
            Senior administration officials acknowledge a central factor in scheduling a state visit with Kenya was the desire to counter China’s influence and financial leverage on the African continent, which has outpaced the United States in direct investment.
     
            “For many, many years, it was really the Chinese who showed up in Africa and in Kenya,” US Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman told CNN in an interview. With the first state visit for an African leader in nearly two decades, “there’s a specific message to Kenya and to the continent, which is: America wants to be your partner.”
     
            For decades, China has been making high-interest loans to low-income African nations to help them fund development for domestic projects, including some flagship infrastructure projects within China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Among those: A high-speed rail route from Nairobi to Mombasa that the Kenyan government funded with billions in loans from Chinese state banks.
     
            A decade after the construction of that railway, Kenya and the US plan to announce that an American company will be building a roadway along that same corridor.
     
            “That’s a great opportunity for America to start bidding on these big government contracts that make a difference to the infrastructure” in Kenya, Whitman told CNN.
     
            From 2000 to 2022, Beijing lent $170 billion to African nations – including $6.7 billion to Kenya – to fund these initiatives, according to Boston University’s Chinese Loans to Africa database. Those loans saddled Africa with costly debt that countries have been increasingly unable to service, leading many nations to seek relief from their sovereign lenders. Kenya’s debt is projected to reach a level of 74% of its economic output, with the country paying an increasing share of government revenue on rising interest costs.
     
            “Too many nations are forced to make a choice between development and debt, between investing in their people and paying back their creditors,” Biden said during a joint press conference with Ruto.
     
            Kenya has been forced to choose between servicing its debt and advancing its development, one reason Kenya’s Ruto has continued to seek new funds from Beijing.
     
            “These countries, I think, have to stay friends with as many people as they can,” Whitman told CNN of Ruto’s continued financial relationship with Beijing. “The needs are great … we have to come with a better offer.”
     
            During the state visit, the US and Kenya are set to announce the “Nairobi-Washington Vision,” calling on creditor countries – and likely China in particular – to provide grants, budget support and debt suspension to help alleviate the burden.
     
            Ruto, meanwhile, has called on African leaders to lean more heavily on Western nations and lower-interest loans from the World Bank to fund their development.
     
            “There’s some real China fatigue in Africa,” said a former senior administration official. “The administration sees an opening there.”
     
            And the US has already begun stepping into that opening. At the Group of 20 summit last year, the US and European Union announced they would back the buildout of a rail corridor connecting Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia that would facilitate the transit of the region’s critical minerals back to the West.
     
            In his meetings with Biden, Ruto has sought to emphasize Kenya – and the broader African continent – as an area worthy of investment. In a gathering of CEOs on Wednesday at the White House, he told his American counterpart that old perceptions of the continent were changing.
     
            “You’re all past thinking about Africa as a place of war and destruction instead of opportunity, and we’re making that real,” Ruto told the president during the meeting, according to a senior US administration official who paraphrased the leader’s remark.
     
            Still, Ruto’s visit to Washington comes at a moment of political instability in many African countries. Military coups over the last year have toppled governments and underscored a fragile rule of law, while traditional American allies on the continent have demonstrated new willingness to break from the United States. One of the goals of Thursday’s state visit is to demonstrate the ability of democracies – like Kenya’s – to deliver for their people.
     
            Biden, who hosted African leaders at the White House for a summit earlier in his term, has been consumed since then by conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Since the December 2022 gathering, during which he declared he was “all in” on Africa, he’s hosted only one African leader for talks at the White House: Angolan President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço.
     
            “It’s no secret that the world has had a lot going on the last year and a half,” a senior administration official said this week, pointing to a stream of Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials who have visited Africa as a sign of the Biden team’s commitment.
     
            Yet the spate of foreign conflicts has prevented Biden himself from paying a visit, which he vowed to do within a year of the summit. He still intends to travel to Africa as president, his national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday, though he couldn’t say when.
     
            Biden said as he welcomed Ruto to the White House on Wednesday he planned to visit Africa next year – after, he hopes, securing reelection.
     
            “I plan on going in February,” Biden told reporters. It wasn’t clear whether Biden was joking; he asked afterward how questions about his travel plans were “relevant.”
     
            Relevant or not, a presidential trip to Africa would come only after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the continent last year for talks with leaders of the BRICS emerging economies.
     
            Advisers say Biden remains intent on focusing attention on Africa, particularly amid jockeying for strategic influence from Russia and China. A comparison with former President Donald Trump – who privately referred to some African countries as “shitholes” and never himself visited Africa when in office – is also not lost on Biden’s aides.
     
            Thursday’s state visit to Washington will be the first for an African leader since 2008.
     
            “We believe that what today will showcase is not questions about the US commitment but answers that the US is actually delivering for Africa, for the African people – in this case, for the country of Kenya, but also with Kenya for the broader continent,” Sullivan said Wednesday.
     
            In choosing Kenya for Thursday’s state visit, Biden and his team are signaling they view Ruto and his country as among the most critical US allies in a region where allegiances toward Washington have shifted.
     
            Kenya has been a key partner for the US in combatting al-Shabab militants in neighboring Somalia and earlier this year joined a US-led international coalition meant to beat back attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes by Houthi rebels in Yemen.
     
            “Around the world, Kenya and America are also standing united against the terror of ISIS and Al-Shabaab, that they continue to perpetrate in East Africa, the aggression that Russia is inflicting on Ukraine, the violence that has toppled too many democracies across both our regions,” Biden said Thursday as he welcomed Ruto to the White House.
     
            Kenya is also preparing to deploy 1,000 paramilitary police officers to Haiti in a bid to quell gang violence, a mission largely funded by the United States that is expected to last at least one year, according to Whitman.
     
            Biden on Thursday defended his administration’s decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters that doing so could raise “all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we’re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States.”
     
            Biden said the US was instead focused on finding “a partner or partners who would lead that effort that we would participate in, not with American forces, but with supplies and making sure they have what they needed.”

            This week, a delegation of Kenyan “command staff” arrived in Haiti, according to a law enforcement source in the country, ahead of the Kenyan-led multinational security support force. The delegation was expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready – an assessment that will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN.
     
            Despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, however, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council.
     
            “This is not something that is a completely straight line. It is a dynamic operating environment, to say the least, in Haiti, and this is going to require an adaptive, flexible approach but one guided by certain core functions and operations,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.

            PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is blowing past market expectations with a massive surge in profit and revenue as American and Chinese consumers swarm its bargain shopping apps for low-cost products.
 
            The Shanghai-based company reported Wednesday that net profit soared 246% to 28 billion yuan ($3.9 billion) in the first quarter of 2024, more than double the average analyst estimate of 12.62 billion yuan ($1.7 billion), according to LSEG data.
     
            Revenue jumped 131% to 86.81 billion yuan ($12 billion) in the period, also comfortably beating expectations. Nomura analysts said that the growth momentum was coming from “both home and abroad.”
     
            The strong results boosted shares of PDD’s (PDD) Nasdaq-listed shares Wednesday, propelling its market value past $204 billion and making it China’s most valuable e-commerce company, ahead of Alibaba (BABA).
     
            Hangzhou-based Alibaba has long dominated China’s online industry, but it has been facing stiff competition from rivals and increased regulatory scrutiny from Beijing.
     
            PDD was founded by Colin Huang in 2015, who stepped down in 2021 as chairman, to pursue a personal interest in life sciences. He is still the company’s biggest shareholder, with a stake of 25% stake, and ranks as China’s second richest man with a fortune of nearly $52 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

            Temu, PDD’s international app, was launched in 2022, and as of last November it had acquired nearly 17% of the US online discount store market, according to Earnest Analytics.
     
            Its Pinduoduo app also continues to grow in China. By mid-2023, Pinduoduo had seen its e-commerce market share rise to 19% from 7.2% in 2019, according to Chinese analytics firm Yinma Data Research. It trailed behind Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall, which owned a combined 44%, and JD.com, which held 24%.
     
            Just eight years old, the startup has successfully leveraged a shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            As the Chinese economy slows and job prospects worsen, people are penny-pinching on everything from groceries to electronics and cars. Discounts and special deals are being offered across brands, including Western companies that primarily target premium markets.
     
            American consumers are also becoming more price aware after two years of elevated inflation. A slew of retailers have announced price cuts in recent weeks to entice people to spend money on things like new clothes and decorative items for the home.
     
            Several investment banks and brokerage firms, including Morgan Stanley and Nomura, increased their price targets for PDD stock after it disclosed the results.
     
            But the company acknowledged that the competition is going to get more intense as rivals try harder to lure consumers with more price cuts.
     
            “We are seeing that our industry peers have significantly stepped up their efforts,” said Lei Chen, co-CEO and chairman of PDD at an earnings call on Wednesday.
     
            Chen said the company must do its best to keep up with consumer market changes.

            “In addition to offering more savings, we are also expected to meet consumers’ needs for higher quality products,” he said.
     
            PDD is also facing potential regulatory hurdles in international markets as it expands globally.
     
            Earlier this month, a European consumer group accused Temu of using “manipulative techniques” to get consumers to spend more than they might want, and called for a regulatory probe into the app.
     
            Last month, South Korean regulators investigated Temu on suspicion of false advertising and unfair ppractices, according to the Yonhap news agency.
 
            Chen said Wednesday that the company is “actively” engaging with regulatory bodies in various countries with “a learning mindset.”
     
            “As our business grows, consumers and regulatory bodies are holding us accountable for ever-higher compliance requirements and also the merchants doing business with us,” he said.

            Apple is offering unprecedented price cuts in China as big brands and retailers launch promotions for the annual “618” shopping festival in the face of sluggish consumer demand.
     
            The hefty discounts by the iPhone maker come at a time when it is battling stiff competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, such as Huawei and Vivo, and declining market share in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            On Monday, Apple said it would slash prices of some of its smartphones on Tmall — an Amazon-like site owned by Alibaba — by as much 23% till May 28.
     
            Customers can now get an iPhone 15 for 4,599 yuan ($639), down 1,400 yuan ($194) from the original price, according to promotions on Apple’s official store on Tmall.
     
            Apple is hoping to boost its sales during China’s second biggest online shopping bonanza of the year, which usually runs from late May to mid-June. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
     
            Launched by e-commerce firm JD.com in 2008, “618” is beaten only by Singles Day, which was created by Alibaba in 2009.

            Today, both festivals eclipse Black Friday and Cyber Monday in terms of total sales, and all major Chinese e-commerce sites and many brick-and-mortar retailers offer weeks of promotions across their platforms to lure customers. Stars often get in on the act, too.
     
            Rihanna appeared in Shanghai Tuesday, making a popular Chinese breakfast crepe and hosting livestream sessions showcasing her Fenty Beauty products on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.
     
            While Apple has been slashing prices of its iPhone 15 models and iPads sold in China since October, the discounts this month are the biggest the company has ever offered in its biggest overseas market, according to Chinese state media.
     
            “Apple needs to aggressively defend market share [in China],” said Jefferies analysts in a note on Tuesday.
     
            Apple’s China market share slid to 15.7% in the first quarter of this year, compared to 19.7% a year earlier, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research. Huawei, meanwhile, saw sales surge 70%, closing in its gap with Apple.
     
            After Monday’s price reductions, Apple’s iPhone 15 is now in the same price range as smartphones made by Xiaomi and Huawei.
     
            Smartphone makers aren’t the only companies waging a price war in China.
     
            Almost every sector, from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, is offering big discounts reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the country.
     
            The 618 shopping festival, a key barometer of consumption in the country, has seen growing competition by e-commerce sites and retailing brands to offer discounts.
     
            But the price cutting has become so brutal that some companies are boycotting the event.
     
            More than 50 book publishers issued joint statements on Monday, saying that they would not participate in the this year’s shopping festival because of aggressive pricing policies that required them to offer discounts of 20% to 30% on JD.com.
     
            One statement, issued by 10 publishing houses in Beijing, said the boycott was a necessary move to “maintain the stability and prosperity” of the book publishing market.
     
            The other statement, published by 46 companies in Shanghai, said they were against “disorderly” competition in the market.
     
            Even major state-owned publishing companies voiced opposition to “chaotic” price wars.
     
            “We hope there will be a wider resistance to the chaos of discounting, or more effective control,” a subsidiary of Shanghai Century Publishing said Monday on its official account on Xiaohongshu, the country’s Instagram-like social platform.

            There’s a reason why Rihanna is a billionaire. She’s a business mogul in every sense: Aside from a prolific music career, she’s launched successful brands including her cosmetics empire Fenty Beauty – worth an estimated $2.8 billion according to Forbes – and her lingerie label Savage X Fenty.
     
            Her latest move in China to promote makeup products is something of a masterclass in how to tap into its lucrative – mostly online – Gen Z market.
     
            On Tuesday night, the chart-topping singer attended a Fenty Beauty pop-up held at a Shanghai photography museum, “servin’ face” according to brand’s Instagram, and “jianbing” – a popular Chinese breakfast crepe that costs about a dollar.
     
            Dressed in a head-to-toe black ensemble, Rihanna cracked an egg, spread yolk, sprinkled scallions, brushed sauce and placed a crunchy cracker onto the savory street food favorite, made on a glittery food cart.
     
            Influential makeup bloggers invited to attend captured the spectacle and Chinese social media sprung to life.
     
            “She makes crepes but not her new album,” joked one user on Douyin, China’s TikTok, while another wrote on Weibo, “She’s so good at it, it’s hard to believe it’s her first time.”
     
            Rihanna is already a beloved star in China, recently appearing on April’s Vogue China cover. She has been viewed as appreciating Chinese culture, famously wearing a glorious golden yellow creation by master couturier Guo Pei to 2015’s China-themed Met Gala.
     
            And the decision to serve up jianbing was a savvy move – one that embraced the star’s moniker among Chinese fans and displayed knowledge of her audience.
     
            In 2011, Chinese fans dubbed her the “Queen of Shandong,” after her hit “We Found Love” was phonetically translated to “weifang de ai” – meaning love of Weifang, a city in eastern China’s Shandong province.
     
            Jianbing is believed to have originated from the same province more than 2,000 years ago and for many in China, the 36-year-old’s turn at making the humble crepe was a full circle moment, with one viral comment on Weibo reading “she’s certified her own Chinese nickname” with the act.
     
            The jianbing buzz only added to the chatter online about the singer’s appearance earlier in the day on Douyin, where she hosted three livestream sessions showcasing Fenty Beauty lip glosses, blushes and other products.
     
            Rihanna then became the number one trending topic on Weibo, with the hashtag #RihannasfirstlivestreaminChina viewed over 81 million times. Another hashtag, #RihannashowsupinShanghai was viewed over 75 million times.

            Besides being a video app, Douyin is a major platform for online shopping – with products and discounts displayed on-screen during livestreams and purchases just a swipe or a click away. In 2022, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing’s commerce ministry.
     
            Other foreign luxury brands have already hosted their own livestream sessions, including Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. China is now the world’s second largest beauty market.
     
            Rihanna’s appearance was part of the platform’s wider “618” (or June 18) campaign, one of China’s most important online shopping events after Singles Day in November, that sees widespread promotions starting nearly a month ahead.
     
            While Fenty Beauty products have been available in the country since 2019, the brand announced this March that it would be expanding its presence via Sephora stores on the mainland. In 2017, the brand launched with an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation and has since added more. Its outsized profitability has dramatically shifted the beauty landscape, with many companies now offering their own more diverse and inclusive range of cosmetics.

            Beijing has launched its most ambitious plan yet to rescue its property market, a development that investors have eagerly anticipated for months. But it’s far from certain that the measures will work.
     
            The package is centered around Beijing’s adoption of a policy that has already been tested in a major city — asking local governments to buy unsold homes from developers and convert them into social affordable housing. It also features a reduction in mortgage interest rates and downpayment ratios, and more importantly, 300 billion yuan ($41.5 billion) in cheap central bank cash to fund state purchases of unsold properties.
     
            The announcement last week swiftly followed an April meeting of the Politburo, China’s top ruling body, indicating that stabilizing the property sector has become a top priority for Beijing as it tries to revive growth in the world’s second biggest economy.
     
            “The policymakers recognize the urgency to prevent an outright property crisis,” said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ Research. “The new rescue plan demonstrates the policymakers’ resolution to turn things around.”
     
            While the urgency is welcome, experts say the current package may be far too small in scale to be effective and could suffer problems with funding.

Biggest fraud in Chinese history? Beijing accuses Evergrande of inflating revenues by $78 billion
 
            According to Goldman Sachs, the total value of unsold homes, unfinished projects and unused land in China is about 30 trillion yuan ($4.1 trillion).
     
            To reduce the supply of housing to levels last seen in 2018, the year the real estate boom peaked, may require more than 7 trillion yuan ($967 billion) for all cities, the Goldman analysts wrote in a Monday research note. That’s more than 20 times the amount of funding announced by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).
     
            Even though China’s economy expanded faster than expected at the start of this year, growth is being weighed down by the all-important real estate sector, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity.
     
            Despite the flurry of announcements last week, it’s still unclear exactly how the government purchases will be implemented and how much is needed to fund the buying. Most importantly, there is lack of clarity on where cash-strapped local governments can get the money to pay for it.
     
            On Friday, Tao Ling, deputy governor of the PBOC, said the relending program could eventually underpin 500 billion yuan ($69 billion) worth of bank loans to support the buying.
     
            But even this figure is much less than what could be needed. Some analysts estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars might be necessary to clear the backlog of millions of empty or unfinished homes across the country.

            Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, who has called the country’s housing problem “epic,” says just finishing construction of pre-sold homes would require at least 3.2 trillion yuan ($442 billion). He estimated that there are currently 20 million pre-sold homes that remain unbuilt.
     
            Helen Qiao, chief economist for Greater China at Bank of America, said the funding size of a maximum of 500 billion yuan was “rather underwhelming.”
     
            Without further expansion, the plan was unlikely to make a “notable difference” to the inventory of empty or unfinished homes, she added.
     
            It’s also unclear where indebted local governments can get the funding, beyond the relatively small amounts the PBOC is channeling via state banks.
     
            The Housing Ministry said Friday that local governments can instruct local state-owned enterprises to help purchase some unsold homes from developers. But local government financing vehicles (LGFV), which are already carrying a huge amount of “hidden” debt, are not allowed to make the purchases, according to Tao from PBOC.
     
            That leaves fewer options for local authorities to find the cash.
     
            Chinese cities have already racked up about $15 trillion in debt, much of it hidden, having borrowed heavily in recent years to cover the cost of pandemic-related spending and infrastructure projects.

             The housing market slump has exacerbated their financial woes, as land sales typically account for more than 40% of local government revenue.
     
            The debt distress has forced many Chinese cities to slash spending, including suspending basic services, such as heating people’s homes in winter.
 
            “It’s debatable whether it’s a good idea to put more debt on already highly-leveraged local governments,” Jing Liu and Taylor Wang, China economists for HSBC, said in a note on Monday.
     
            China’s property industry began to cool in 2019 and fell into a deep trough about three years ago after a government-led clampdown on developers’ borrowing.
     
            Policy rescue efforts started as early as 2022, when the slump triggered crises at some developers and sparked protests by tens of thousands of homebuyers in response to delayed or stalled projects.
     
            But the measures have been largely ineffective, resulting in a deterioration of cash flow among developers. The most recent saga at Vanke, a major real estate company, suggests every developer is at risk, Xing said.
     
            Addressing the oversupply of unsold homes is only the first step, experts say. Broadly speaking, the government needs to tackle three problems, according to Goldman analysts.
     
            The first step involves bailing out developers and helping them complete pre-sold but unfinished homes, which is what the new measures are intended to tackle.
     
            “This is important for maintaining overall social stability and stemming further declines in new home sales,” they said.

China unveils ‘historic’ rescue for crisis-hit property sector as home prices slump again
 
            But the second and third steps involve boosting housing demand and mitigating the contraction in property construction, they said. That requires more detailed measures to revive consumer confidence and boost housing prices.
     
            Making matters worse, the external environment has become increasingly difficult.
     
            Last week, the US government announced new tariffs on China, which could be followed by similar action by the European Union. Former President Donald Trump has threatened to go even further by slapping 60% tariffs on imports from China if he is re-elected.
     
            Xing estimated that Trump’s proposed tariffs could cut China’s growth rate by as much as 0.9%.
     
            “The rescue is not a game-changer for low-tier cities’ housing, which will likely remain depressed,” Michelle Lam and Wei Yao, China economists at Société Générale, said in a research note on Monday.
     
            They also think the rescue plan needs to be expanded, with more detailed policies to be announced. But what matters the most is that Beijing has taken the bold initiative, which will help stabilize expectations.
     
            Taking a long-term perspective, the plan could reduce the risk of China sliding into a “deflationary spiral” like Japan did, as a key lesson from there is that policy makers should avoid doing too little, too late, they said.
     
            “[This might be] the beginning of the end of China’s housing crisis,” they added.

            Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing to cease its intimidation of the democratic island after he was was sworn in as president Monday, marking the start of a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has championed democracy in the face of years of growing threats from authoritarian China.
     
            Lai, 64, a former doctor and vice president, was inaugurated alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States.
     
            Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty. China’s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.
     
            Lai used his 30-minute inaugural speech to broadcast a message of peace and declare that a “glorious era of Taiwan’s democracy has arrived,” describing the island as an “important link” in a “global chain of democracies,” while reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty.
     
            “The future of the Republic of China Taiwan will be decided by its 23 million people. The future we decide is not just the future of our nation, but the future of the world,” Lai said, using the formal name for Taiwan.
     
            Lai takes up the mantle from his DPP predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, who bolstered the island’s international standing and recognition during her eight years in office. Tsai, Taiwan’s first female president, was unable to stand again because of term limits.
     
            Lai emerged victorious over rivals in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party and the Taiwan People’s Party in a January election, which was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose.
     
            Then, voters shrugged off warnings from Beijing that the DPP’s re-election would increase the risk of conflict. The DPP holds the view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China’s threats and deepen relations with democratic countries.
     
            In his inaugural address, Lai called on China “to cease their political and military intimidation against Taiwan, share with Taiwan the global responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from the fear of war.”
     
            A soft-spoken political veteran, Lai hails from a more radical wing of the DPP, and was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence – a red line for Beijing.
     
            Though his views have tempered since then, China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a “practical worker for Taiwan independence.”
     
            Lai has now said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country” so there is “no plan or need” to declare independence, in a deliberately nuanced stance that mimics the one held by outgoing Tsai.
     
            When asked about Lai’s inauguration in a regular briefing Monday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said “Taiwan independence is a dead end. No matter what pretext or banner one uses, promoting Taiwan independence and secession is doomed to fail.”
     
            Lai’s inauguration ceremony was attended by national leaders from a handful of countries with which Taiwan still maintains formal diplomatic ties, several former American officials, and lawmakers from other countries, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
     
            In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered his congratulations to Lai and “the Taiwan people for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust and resilient democratic system.”
     
            “We look forward to working with President Lai and across Taiwan’s political spectrum to advance our shared interests and values, deepen our longstanding unofficial relationship, and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Blinken said.
     
            Lai takes office during a particularly contentious period between Taiwan and China, which in recent years has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-governing democracy as Taiwan’s leaders tightened informal ties with Washington.
     
            In his inaugural address, Lai said he hoped China would “face the reality of the Republic of China’s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan,” and “engage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan’s people.”
     
            He called for the resumption of tourism on a reciprocal basis and enrollment of degree students in Taiwanese institutions as steps to “pursue peace and mutual prosperity.”
     
            But the new president also warned against harboring delusions, even as Taiwan pursues “the ideals of peace.”
     
            “So long as China refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to understand, that even if we accept the entirety of China’s position and give up our sovereignty, China’s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear,” Lai said.
     
            Beijing has sought to portray Lai as inciting conflict, repeatedly framing the elections earlier this year as a choice between “peace and war.”
     
            On Monday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that rhetoric, slamming “the leader of the Taiwan region” as “sending dangerous signals of seeking independence, provocations and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”

Tsai Ing-wen: the leader who put Taiwan on the map and stood up to China
 
            Xi has placed “reunification” with Taiwan as a key part of his goal to achieve China’s “natural rejuvenation.” But under the strongarm tactics of his more than one decade in power, Taiwan’s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3% identify primarily as Chinese.
     
            The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing.
     
            Beijing has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP refused to endorse the so-called “1992 consensus” that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to “one China,” but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue.
     
            Official communication between Beijing and Taipei is unlikely to resume as Lai takes office – with China repeatedly rebuking his offer for talks and denouncing him as a dangerous separatist.
     
            Lai is also set to face challenges – and scrutiny – in pushing through his agenda for Taiwan in parliament during his term.
     
            Unlike his predecessor, Lai will not have a parliamentary majority in the next four years. In January’s election, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party only won 51 out of 113 seats.
     
            Those challenges were on show last Friday, when Taiwanese lawmakers’ disagreements over new, controversial reform bills erupted in a brawl on the parliamentary floor – a chaotic display that saw some lawmakers leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor, with a few members taken to hospital.
     
            In his address, Lai said that “a lack of absolute majority means that the ruling and opposition parties are now all able to share their ideas, and that we will be undertaking the nation’s challenges as one.”
     
            But he also called for cooperation so Taiwan could “continue down a stable path.”

            China has hinted at possible tit-for-tat action against trade barriers imposed by the United States last week, as relations between the two economic superpowers become increasingly fraught.
     
            On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into polyoxymethylene or POM copolymers, a thermoplastic used in various industries ranging from auto parts to electronics, imported from the US, the European Union, Taiwan and Japan.
     
            Thermoplastics are malleable when heated but become fixed in a solid shape when cooled, and can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc.
     
            The investigation should take a year to complete, but may be extended by another six months, the ministry added.
     
            The announcement comes days after President Joe Biden said that tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and an array of other products would soar over the next two years.
     
            EVs imported from China will see their tariffs nearly quadruple from 27.5% to 100%, a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing’s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports.
     
            The White House said the measures were designed to protect American workers and businesses in the face of China’s unfair trade practices, including “flooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.”
     
            In response, China has vowed to take “all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.”
     
            The EU is also investigating state support for Chinese EV makers and, if it finds that their prices are artificially low, it will announce extra import duties by early July.

            Tsai Ing-wen never set out to be a leader. Growing up shy, she aspired to become an archeologist, because “people that are dead already wouldn’t jump up and argue with you.”
     
            But instead of picking over the remains of history, the self-described introvert ended up charting a new course for Taiwan in some of the world’s choppiest geopolitical waters.
     
            “At this very moment, Taiwan faces a difficult situation,” Tsai said in her inauguration speech when she became the island’s first female president in 2016. She was handed a flatlining economy, a lagging military and a groundswell of discontent over her predecessor’s push to forge closer ties with neighboring China, an authoritarian giant that has vowed to one day absorb the self-ruled democracy.
     
            Eight years on, as the 67-year-old prepares to step down after two terms in office, she leaves the island of 23 million people with an elevated international profile, a firmer partnership with the United States, ongoing defense reforms and a consolidated sense of its distinct Taiwanese identity.
     
            It is also left with the looming threat of invasion by China, which has grown more assertive and belligerent under strongman leader Xi Jinping. Xi has ramped up pressure on Taiwan and vowed to never renounce the use of force to bring it under control.
     
            While supporters applaud Tsai for standing up to China, defending Taiwan’s sovereignty, freedom and democracy, critics blame her for straining ties with Beijing, stoking cross-strait tensions.
     
            Under Tsai, Taiwan, which has its own past of brutal authoritarian rule and repression of minorities, has championed LGBTQ rights and become a bastion of democracy and liberal values in Asia, offering a stark contrast to Xi’s authoritarian, socially conservative and patriarchal vision for China.
     
            Domestically, there have been mounting public grievances over livelihood issues, especially Taiwan’s stubbornly low wages and unaffordable housing. But according to multiple polls, Tsai is leaving office with a net-positive approval rating – unprecedented among Taiwan’s outgoing leaders in the democratic era.
     
            On Monday, Tsai will hand the baton to her former premier and vice president Lai Ching-te, who will be sworn in as Taiwan’s new president after winning the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) an unprecedented third term in January.
     
            Days before the election, Tsai summed up the island’s transformation over the past eight years in her last New Year’s address as president. “What has changed is that Taiwan is no longer overlooked,” she said. “If someone were to ask me what my legacy for Taiwan is, I would say that I am leaving behind a Taiwan of the world.”
     
            Tsai is an unconventional politician in Taiwan. Reserved by nature, she cut a quiet figure in a boisterous democracy known for its festival-like rallies and emotional political speeches. She never married or had children and is an animal lover whose beloved pets frequently featured on her social media accounts, something that endeared her to many young people.
     
            She used to be so shy that she would lower her head to avoid meeting people’s eyes when walking down the street, Wellington Koo, her national security advisor, said in Taiwan in Transition, a documentary on Tsai’s presidency. In another documentary, Invisible Nation, Tsai admitted she never dreamed of becoming a president and dreaded talking to people when she was young.
     
            “I wanted a quiet life. I thought I would become a historian or an archeologist to study things that happened in the past, (because) people that are dead already wouldn’t jump up and argue with you,” she said.
     
            But she ended up studying law and becoming a professor, before working as a trade negotiator for Taiwan and a government minister responsible for China policy. Years working as a non-partisan technocrat imbued her with a “modest, quiet and calm” style of leadership, according to Invisible Nation’s director Vanessa Hope.
     
            Tsai entered politics at 48 years old, when she joined the ruling DPP in 2004. Four years later, the political latecomer faced little competition to become DPP’s chairperson as the party reeled from a crushing presidential election defeat. She first ran for president in 2012, but lost to incumbent Ma Ying-jeou from the Kuomintang (KMT).
     
            She succeeded at the second try, making history not only as Taiwan’s first woman president, but also one of the first women in Asia elected to top office without hailing from a political dynasty.
     
            “People always think that I’m a very cold person,” Tsai said in Invisible Nation. “But the day I was elected president, that was the most emotional moment in my life.”
     
            Since Tsai took office, Taiwan has been caught in an intensifying battle for dominance between China and the US, a global pandemic and the geopolitical and economic fallouts from raging wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
     
            Through it all, the island has boosted its international standing and recognition, bolstering its role as a key democratic partner and an indispensable link in the global microchip supply chain.
     
            In 2019, Taiwan became the first Asian jurisdiction to legalize same-sex marriage. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, it won international praise for its exemplary response and efforts to help other countries, despite its exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO). Taipei has also enjoyed a surge of international backing from like-minded partners, including the US, Japan and the Czech Republic.
     
            “She’ll be known as the one who put Taiwan on the map internationally,” said Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.
     
            During China’s rapid rise to become the world’s second-largest economy and a major power, Taiwan had at times found itself something of an afterthought. Now, the island’s strategic importance – it is the world’s largest producer of advanced semiconductors – has thrust it to the center of geopolitical calculations, with peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait becoming a matter of global concern.
     
            Amid hardening global fault lines, Tsai worked to strengthen ties with the US during both the Trump and Biden administrations. The two sides bolstered economic cooperation, reciprocated high-level political visits and expanded US arms sales to Taiwan. Support for Taiwan has become one of the few issues of bipartisan consensus ahead of the US presidential elections.
     
            “We have seen a normative shift in the way that Western governments talk about Taiwan, in ways that legitimize its sovereignty,” said Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group.
     
            “US-China competition and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine were also factors that accelerated this trend. But she took advantage of the geopolitical winds.”
     
            Despite tightening ties with its most important security guarantor, the island lost 10 diplomatic allies to Beijing during Tsai’s tenure. It has also been excluded from the WHO’s annual assembly since 2016, losing its previous observer status since Tsai took office.
     
            Poaching Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies and blocking it from attending the World Health Assembly as an observer is widely seen as part of Beijing’s efforts to pressure Tsai into toeing its political line. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP have refused to endorse the so-called “1992 consensus” that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to “one China,” but with different interpretations of what that means.
     
            Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue, has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. In addition to the diplomatic squeeze, Xi has ramped up economic and military coercion, slapping tariffs on Taiwanese imports and routinely sending warplanes close to the island.
     
            Tensions came to a head in August 2022, when China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.
     
            But Tsai also maintained a deliberately cautious stance, avoiding provoking Beijing with endorsement of Taiwan’s formal independence, something many in her party openly favor and advocate for. Instead, she argued that Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is already “an independent country” and therefore has no need to declare independence.
     
            Analysts say Tsai moved the DPP’s position on cross-strait relations closer to the center of politics in Taiwan, from a more fiercely pro-independence stance.
     
            Polls show growing numbers of Taiwanese – especially young people – view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese – while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese.
     
            But Huang Kwei-bo, professor of diplomacy at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, criticized Tsai’s pivot toward the US at the expense of ties with China.
     
            “Taiwan needs to work closely with the US…but it would be unwise of Taiwan to lose political communication channels with Beijing,” he said, noting that Taiwan can’t simply rely on deterrence or military operations to defend itself.
     
            “Maintaining political relations with Beijing is another necessary approach to better security for Taiwan,” he added.
     
            Weeks after Tsai was sworn in, she attended a graduation ceremony at Taiwan’s Military Academy and delivered a stern message: “Our armed forces need to be reformed in a big, bold way…We also need to reform our national defense systems and culture.”
     
            Since then, she has often shown up at military events, sometimes donning bulletproof vests and helmets among soldiers – challenging prejudices that question women’s ability to command the military.
     
            Over her tenure, Tsai has boosted military spending, extended mandatory military service from four months to a year and accelerated the development of its indigenous weapons program to boost combat readiness, including the island’s first domestically produced submarine. These developments “give confidence to Taiwan’s security partners in terms of the island’s determination for its own fair share for providing its own security,” Sung said.
     
            Taipei has also been talking with Washington to establish a “contingency stockpile” of munitions on Taiwanese soil. The US is bound by law to supply Taiwan with weapons to defend itself, and for decades the Taiwanese military has been purchasing fighter jets and missiles from Washington.
     
            But under Tsai, Taiwan has sought to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities, developing and procuring cheaper and more mobile weapon systems that could be instrumental in halting a potential Chinese invasion.
     
            Taiwanese military experts have increasingly advocated for such an approach, noting that Taiwan can never match China in military might and assets. Despite the increases, Taiwan’s defense budget is still dwarfed by that of China, accounting for less than 10% of Beijing’s military spending.
     
            But Taiwan can still make itself an enormously costly place for China to try and overrun without having to match its far larger, wealthier neighbor. The war in Ukraine has shown Taiwan the effectiveness of portable missiles and drones on the battlefield in fending off a more powerful enemy, experts say.
     
            “The international environment shifted and that contributed to this awareness in Taiwan of how close war could be,” Hsiao said. “Tsai opened the door to defense reform and the idea that defending Taiwan requires a whole-of-society effort.”
     
            Tsai has also left a mixed domestic legacy.
     
            Her push to legalize same-sex marriage angered conservatives, especially in rural regions, but made Taiwan the envy of LGBTQ communities across Asia. This week, days before stepping down as president, Tsai invited Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind to perform the first ever drag show at the presidential office, following her win on hit TV series “RuPaul’s Drag Race” last month.
     
            Tsai has also sought to revitalize economic growth and address social inequality, nurturing emerging industries such as renewable energy and launching pension reforms. During her tenure, Taiwan’s economy grew at an average rate of over 3%, but many residents say the economic benefits are little felt in their everyday lives. Instead, Tsai’s administration has faced mounting discontent over stagnant wages, skyrocketing housing prices and cost of living.
     
            She has also been criticized for sluggish judicial reforms, failure to rein in online scams and a plan to phase out nuclear energy, as well as not going far enough in implementing transitional justice and promoting indigenous rights.
     
            “Under her reign, there has been a squeeze on airtime for more local and bread-and-butter issues,” said Sung. “And you see this reflected in the election results as well.”
     
            Tsai’s DPP suffered huge losses in two mid-term elections, where local issues normally trump national security as voters’ primary concern.
     
            Near the end of her first term, Tsai’s approval ratings plummeted and her chance for a second term was looking increasingly uncertain – until pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong in 2019 against Beijing’s tightening grip. She campaigned heavily on promises to not allow Taiwan to become another Hong Kong, and received a landslide victory.
     
            In January’s presidential elections, public grievances over livelihood issues became a focal point of criticism against the DPP, splitting votes – especially from young people – to a third-party candidate who promised a more “scientific and pragmatic” approach in addressing those issues.
     
            The DPP also lost its majority in the national legislature, leaving more potential political gridlock for the incoming Lai administration to push through policies and legislation.
     
            As Tsai hands the baton to Lai, analysts say it might still be too early to draw conclusions on her legacy.
     
            “How we ultimately judge her legacy will depend on what happens in the next administration as well, as in what they do with what Tsai has achieved,” Hsiao said.

            China has unveiled wide-ranging measures to rescue its property sector, including asking local governments across the country to buy unsold homes from beleagured developers and easing rules on purchases.
     
            Even though China’s economy expanded faster than expected at the start of this year, growth is being weighed down by the all-important real estate sector, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity.
     
            He Lifeng, vice premier and the Communist Party’s top economic official, said Friday that municipal governments should buy unsold homes and convert them into affordable social housing, in a plan that has been trailed as a major solution for the country’s crisis-ridden property sector.
     
            In a coordinated move, the People’s China of China (PBOC) announced that it will set up a nationwide program to provide 300 billion yuan ($41.5 billion) in loans to fund state purchases of unsold homes.
     
            Tao Ling, deputy governor of the central bank, said at a press conference in Beijing that it will encourage commercials banks to support local state-owned enterprises to buy unsold homes and turn them into social housing. The 300 billion yuan provided by the central bank could eventually underpin 500 billion yuan ($69 billion) worth of credit to support such purchases, she estimated.

            Expectations that Beijing was preparing a plan to have local governments across the country buy millions of unsold homes have successfully buoyed China stocks. Investors have been steadily pouring money back into Chinese shares since last month.
     
            China Real Estate Business, a newspaper run by the country’s housing ministry, described the measures as “heavyweight policies” that marked a “significant historic moment” for the real estate sector. 
 
            Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, said the move to buy unsold homes was “positive” for the industry, but that the plan was missing key details such as how much would be funded.
     
            “Looking ahead, the key is when and at what scale the central government can provide a funding source,” he wrote in a Friday research note.
     
            China’s local governments have already racked up $15 trillion in debt, much of it hidden, having borrowed heavily in recent years to cover the cost of pandemic-related spending and infrastructure projects. 
 
            Over the past two years, the Chinese authorities have introduced many measures to revive the depressed real estate sector — to little avail. Analysts have long been calling on them to do much more.
     
            Friday’s sweeping rescue measures come as new data suggested the property downturn worsened in April.
     
            Government data published Friday showed that property investment declined 9.8% in the first four months of 2024, accelerating from the 9.5% fall recorded in the first quarter.
     
            New property sales plunged 28.3% in the January-to-April period, compared with a 27.6% drop in January-March. New home prices fell for a 10th consecutive month by 0.6% month-on-month in April, the fastest decline since November 2014, according to Reuters.
     
            “All this bad news seems to have finally triggered a sense of urgency that’s strong enough to force material action,” analysts from Société Générale wrote in a note on Friday.
     
            The analysts were referring to the government’s announcement, PBOC cuts to mortgage rates and the first batch in the sale of one trillion yuan ($138 billion) of ultra-long Treasury bonds on Friday.
     
            On Friday, He also urged local governments to buy back or directly purchase land that has been sold to developers but not yet used. The move would help ease financial difficulties of property companies.
     
            In China, land is mostly owned by the state. The government can sell the rights to use the land to property developers, which is a significant source of fiscal revenue.
     
            The PBOC also made major additional moves to rescue the housing market.
     
            It effectively allowed banks to set their own mortgage rates, removing a nationwide minimum; cut the minimum down-payment ratio for first-time buyers to 15% and 25% for second-home buyers; and lowered the interest rates for housing provident fund loans by 0.25 percentage points, according to three separate statements by the central bank.

            Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin’s meeting in Beijing on Thursday left no question of how closely the Chinese and Russian leaders are aligned in their vision for the world – and on bolstering the “powerful driving force” of their autocratic double act.
     
            The two vowed to deepen their strategic partnership, and took aim at a United States they painted as a destabilizing aggressor.
     
            In a sweeping 7,000-word joint statement outlining their shared view on issues from Taiwan to the war in Gaza, they proclaimed: “Russian-Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history.”
     
            The meeting made for a deeply incongruous split-screen. As Xi and Putin sipped tea from wicker chairs in manicured gardens of the official Zhongnanhai compound and discussed how to “promote world peace and common development,” Ukrainian civilians called for evacuation from villages under assault from Russian forces.
     
            Putin’s two-day state visit comes as Western leaders have leant on Xi to ensure that soaring exports from his country aren’t propping up the Russian war effort – a claim Beijing denies.
     
            But even as Putin’s pomp-filled welcome in the Chinese capital seemed to fly in the face of Western concerns about the partnership, Putin appeared to depart Beijing with few, publicly acknowledged gains — though it remains unclear what happened in discussions behind closed doors.
     
            Here are three key takeaways from the meeting.
     
            Xi and Putin used their meetings and hefty statement to take aim at what they described as a global security system defined by US-backed military alliances – and pledged to work together to counter it.
     
            “[We] intend to increase interaction and tighten coordination in order to counter Washington’s destructive and hostile course towards the so-called ‘dual containment’ of our countries,” the leaders pledged in their joint statement.
     
            The joint statement also called on the US not to arm its allies with missile systems, and condemned US cooperation with allies as “extremely destabilizing.”
     
            The US considers China the “most serious long-term challenge to the international order,” and Russia “a clear and present threat.”
     
            The strident declaration comes as both Russia and China have criticized US support for Israel and its war against militant group Hamas and sought to bolster ties across the Global South, where there is mounting backlash against Israel’s actions in Gaza.
     
            On that conflict, they called for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, while also voicing their points of alignment on a range of other contentious geopolitical issues including Taiwan and North Korea.
     
            While slamming US military alliances, the two leaders pledged to “deepen” military “trust and cooperation,” saying they would expand joint exercises and combat training, regularly conduct joint sea and air patrols, and improve the “capabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.”
     
            The two nations have grown their military drills around the world in recent years, continuing after Russia launched its war in Ukraine in February 2022 – drawing concern from Western observers that the two US rivals are working to enhance their military interoperability.
     
            Putin also traveled to Beijing with top security officials who the Russian president said Thursday would join informal talks on Ukraine. Newly appointed Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, and his predecessor Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu, both attended.

            It wasn’t clear if Chinese defense officials joined those talks, which took place, according to Russia state media, during four-hour informal negotiations behind the gates of the heavily secured Zhongnanhai compound — the residence for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
     
            The Chinese Foreign Ministry quoted Xi as reiterating a call for a “political solution” in Ukraine, as well as his support for a peace conference recognized by both sides.
     
            Observers say Putin was likely interested in discussing material support for Russia’s war or defense industry, including dual-use items the US has said China is exporting to Russia, which power its defense industrial base. Beijing, which says it is neutral on the war, has repeatedly defended its trade with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations.
     
            But such negotiations may show the limits of the partnership, at least when it comes to China increasing its support to include weapons. Xi, analysts say, is seeking to keep Putin as a close partner, while not stepping over Western red lines.
     
            “Putin has gone to China in order to ask for more help from China, help he is unlikely to receive … he’s not going to get weapons and ammunition and other types of direct support from China for Russia’s war effort,” former US ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told CNN.
     
            Despite the lofty rhetoric, information on any major deals brokered during the meeting was scant as Putin departed Beijing for the second day of the visit in northeastern China’s Harbin.
     
            One deal apparently left un-inked was on plans for a “Power of Siberia 2” pipeline, which would funnel Russian natural gas to China. Beijing is widely seen as hesitating on the long-hyped deal, which Putin wants to replace revenue lost as Europe reduces its reliance on Russian fuels after the Ukraine invasion.

            Instead, the leaders in broad strokes pledged to “jointly promote the implementation of large-scale energy projects,” while upping energy cooperation across oil, liquified natural gas, natural gas, coal and electricity.
     
            They also called for strengthening industrial cooperation across a range of fields including civil aviation construction, electronics, chemical industry, shipbuilding and industrial equipment.
     
            These pledges, however vague, do signpost more economic coordination in the years to come.
     
            “For Putin, it’s a glory moment that Russia is still on its feet (economically) … mostly because of the lifeline provided by China,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
     
            For that reason, she added, “he’s okay with on-going dependency between Russia and China – and with inequality in this relationship.”

            Microsoft has asked at least 100 of its employees in China to consider moving to other countries, according to Chinese state media reports.
     
            The reports come as relations between Beijing and Washington deteriorate over technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and clean energy.
     
            Microsoft employees, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet The Paper said in a report Wednesday, citing an unnamed source.
     
            “Providing internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. It did not specify the number of workers who had received the offer.
     
            The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating. The Journal, which cited unnamed sources, reported last year that the Biden administration was preparing to restrict Chinese firms’ access to US cloud services.
     
            The company entered China in 1992 and for decades has counted on its well-known Beijing-based research lab, Microsoft Research Lab Asia, to help it build influence.
     
            “Everyone is confused,” an employee told the Paper, as the affected staff has been given less than a month to decide.
     
            Yicai, a Chinese state-owned financial media outlet, wrote that more than 100 employees were affected. It added that people had the option not to move.
     
            The reports come in the same week President Joe Biden announced tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and an array of other products. Biden said he was trying to prevent unfair competition from China decimating US industries.
     
            The tech war between the two economic superpowers has been intensifying for years. In October, the Biden administration limited the types of semiconductors that American companies can sell to China.
     
            In recent months, the United States has also enlisted its allies in Europe and Asia in restricting sales of advanced chipmaking equipment to China.
     
            Beijing has hit back by imposing its own curbs on exports of germanium and gallium, two elements essential for making semiconductors.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in Beijing on Thursday, in a stark show of their growing alignment as Moscow’s troops advance in Ukraine.
     
            Putin — whose delegation includes top defense and security officials — was welcomed by Xi to Beijing’s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of the Russian president’s two-day state visit.
     
            A sweeping joint statement released by the two leaders laid out their countries’ alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine, Taiwan and conflict in the Middle East.
     
            The visit — Putin’s symbolic first overseas foray since starting a new term as Russia’s president last week — is the latest sign of tightening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy friction with the West.
     
            The statement proclaimed that China-Russian relations have stood “the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,” the two leaders calling each other “priority partners.”
     
            Putin, whose country’s economy has become increasingly reliant on China since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, hailed the countries’ “practical cooperation” in meetings with Xi, noting their record bilateral trade last year, while stressing the importance of bolstering energy, industrial, and agriculture cooperation, according to Russian state media Tass.
     
            Their meeting is Putin and Xi’s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine — weeks after the two declared a “no limits” partnership on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.
     
            This week’s state visit comes amid mounting international concern about the direction of the war in Ukraine amid delays to aid for Kyiv and as Russia’s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions — a situation that United States officials have alleged is linked to Chinese support, which Beijing denies.
     
            Putin says he and Xi will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening, which are expected to include Russia’s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia’s Security Council.
     
            Putin’s red-carpet welcome to Beijing comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced via his office that he would halt all upcoming international visits, as his troops defend against a surprise Russian offensive in his country’s northeastern Kharkiv region.
     
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Kyiv earlier this week to reaffirm the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine after months of Congressional delay in approving American military aid to the embattled country. Blinken pledged $2 billion in foreign military financing and said much-needed ammunition and weapons are being rushed to the front lines.

            Pressure has also been mounting on Xi from both the US and Europe to ensure soaring exports from China to Russia since the start of the war aren’t propping up the Kremlin’s war effort.
     
            White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support for Russia’s defense industrial base — in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and microelectronics exported from China. Beijing has slammed the US as making “groundless accusations” over “normal trade and economic exchanges” between China and Russia.
     
            Beijing has never condemned Russia’s invasion, rather it claims neutrality in the conflict and has released a vaguely articulated 12-point position on its resolution. Ahead of an expected peace conference in Switzerland next month, Xi has called for peace talks that take both sides’ positions into account.
     
            “China hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role,” Xi said in a joint press appearance with Putin.
     
            On Ukraine, Russia said in Thursday’s joint statement that it welcomed the readiness of China “to play a constructive role” in the political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict and that “it is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,” in an apparent allusion to their shared view that NATO is responsible for the conflict in Ukraine.
     
            This week’s visit marks the leaders’ 43rd meeting in the more than one decade that Xi has been in power. Xi and Putin, known for their close personal chemistry, have steadily expanded their countries’ diplomatic coordination and economic and security cooperation in that time — as both faced mounting frictions with the US and its allies.
     
            Even as Xi seeks to repair frayed relations with Europe and stabilize his country’s ties with the US, he is widely seen as unwilling to sacrifice his partnership with Putin, who the Chinese leader sees as an indispensable partner in reshaping a world order both believe is unfairly dominated by the US and seeking to contain them.
     
            This shared worldview was also on show Thursday as Xi, speaking alongside Putin, decried a lingering “Cold War mentality,” and said “unilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country” — using language typical of Beijing and Moscow’s criticisms of the US and its allies.
     
            The two leaders said in the joint statement they will “deepen trust and cooperation” in the military field by expanding the scope of joint exercises and combat training, regularly conducting joint sea and air patrols and improving the “capabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.”
     
            Putin nodded to Xi’s concerns about rising engagement between NATO and like-minded countries in Asia, calling for a “reliable and adequate architecture of security in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there will be no place for closed military-political alliances.”
     
            “We think the creation of such alliances to be counterproductive and harmful,” Putin said following meetings Thursday.
     
            In the statement, the two countries also expressed “very deep concern” over what they described as US military activity with allies “that have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation,” calling the actions “extremely destabilizing.”
     
            The two leaders “reaffirmed there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be fought,” and called for revisions to global security arrangements to prevent military confrontation.
     
            Besides engagements in Beijing, which are expected to include a “gala” marking the two countries’ 75 years of diplomatic ties, Putin is also expected to attend trade and cooperation forums in Harbin, the capital of China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province bordering Russia’s Far East.
     
            The region is historically a site of long-simmering border tensions between the two neighbors, which erupted in conflict between China and the Soviet Union in 1969. It has seen increasing connectivity with parts of Russia’s Far East in recent years.
     
            Putin is also expected to meet with the students and faculty of the Harbin Institute of Technology, a university sanctioned by the US government in 2020 for its alleged role in procuring items for China’s military.

            Chinese stocks surged on Thursday after officials in a major city announced plans to buy unsold homes in what some analysts believe could be a trial run for a much bigger solution to the country’s property crisis.
 
            Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 1.6%, hitting its highest level since August. The index has rallied nearly 30% from its January low, having entered a bull market earlier this month.
     
            Property developers, which were up 3.1% on average, led the way.
     
            Longfor Group, the ninth largest homebuilder in China, surged 11%, becoming the top performing stock on the Hang Seng Index. Sunshine 100 China Holdings, a Beijing-based developer, soared 127%, the best performer on the broader market.
     
            The rally comes after a district in the megacity of Hangzhou announced that the government would directly purchase unsold residential homes from the market and convert them into affordable housing.
     
            The announcement reinforced expectations that the Chinese government is considering a proposal to have local governments across the country buy millions of unsold homes, dubbed a “major solution” by Chinese media for the crisis-ridden property sector.
     
            Adding to the expectations, the National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s top economic planner, pledged on Thursday to “promote affordable housing” and explore “a new model” for the real estate sector.
     
            “We think this is a largely symbolic move to show support for the sector with a ‘national team’ for the housing market,” said Citi analysts.

Hong Kong stocks are back from the dead. Here’s why
 
            Speculation about just such a bailout has been rife since last month, when a Chinese media outlet reported that Beijing was learning from Japan’s experience of decades of stagnation and considering a plan to acquire unfinished housing units across the country. These units would then be turned into low-cost housing and would be sold or rented out.
     
            “[The proposal is] a much bigger support measure than the current pilot initiatives across the country, and one that is helping ease the negative spillover [for stocks] from fresh US tariffs on Chinese exports,” said analysts from ING Group.
     
            But fund managers are more cautious.
     
            “We are cautiously optimistic about the ‘government-led buying on unsold units’ as it’s still being rolled out in more cities, “ said Jeff Zhang, an equity analyst at Morningstar. “Funding issue could remain a key concern.”
     
            Beijing has struggled to contain the country’s prolonged property crisis, which has become a major drag on the economy and sparked nationwide protests by homebuyers.
     
            Many big cities have relaxed home-purchase restrictions over the past few weeks, including Hangzhou, Xi’an and Chengdu.
     
            At the end of last month, the Politburo, the top decision-making body of China’s Communist Party, vowed to explore new measures to tackle the housing crisis, including implementing “city-specific” policies to reduce housing inventory.
     
            Investors have been steadily pouring money back into Chinese shares since last month. The rebound follows a prolonged sell-off that sent key indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai to their lowest levels in years, wiping trillions off the value of listed companies.
     
            Nasdaq Golden China Index, which tracks Chinese companies listed on Wall Street, has gained 11% since the start of April. It hit the highest level in more than seven months on Monday.

            Australian police are seeking two people for allegedly vandalizing a century-old Chinese parade dragon and other valuable artefacts at a museum in a small town known for its historic links to China.
     
            The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum.
     
            Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5.
     
            “Investigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,” police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time.
     
            Among the artefacts attacked was Loong – described by the museum as the “oldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.”
     
            “Loong” is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture – usually translated as dragon in English – and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals.
     
Dragon dances have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets.
     
            Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town’s residents.
     
            Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called “Dai Gum San” - or “Big Gold Mountain,” according to Bendigo Tourism.
     
            To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital.
     
            The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 “to document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia” according to the museum’s website.
     
            Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired.
     
            Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong’s nose.
     
            Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon’s tongue.
     
            Other parts of the museum were also targeted.
     
            Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip.
     
            Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said.
     
            “With these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,” he said.
     
            The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act “may have been racially motivated.”

            As countries around the world ramped up sanctions on Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became clear that the Russian president still had a powerful friend in Xi Jinping.
     
            The Chinese leader, who declared a “no limits” partnership with Russia weeks before the full-scale invasion, set a policy of decrying sanctions and continuing to strengthen ties with Putin. On Thursday, Xi welcomed the Russian president to China for a two-day state visit — their fourth in-person meeting since Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine began.
     
            The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together — with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel.
     
            The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases of related goods that are consistent with those claims.
     
            China has repeatedly defended its trade with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace.
     
            Here’s how the two sides have upgraded their ties since February 2022.
     
            The European Union, the US and many of its allies and others across the world have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications.
     
            Despite these efforts to isolate Putin’s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia’s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That followed a contraction in 2022, according to Russian state media.
     
            The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with — and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline, greatly expanding trade ties with its northern neighbor. The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade, hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule — a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi.
 
            That’s driven China to rank as Russia’s top trade partner, Putin declared last year, with his presidential aide later confirming to Russian state media that the country had surpassed the EU to take that spot.
     
            As the EU slashed purchases of Russian fuel and limited exports ranging from high-tech goods to transportation equipment, China bolstered its own exports of industrial and commercial goods to the country, such as vehicles, machinery and home appliances, data and official statements show.
     
            Russia has also become China’s main oil supplier, overtaking Saudi Arabia, according to official Chinese trade data. China, however, is not alone in taking advantage of Russia’s need to find new markets for its fuel, with India also among buyers upping imports in the wake of the war.
     
            The wartime surge in trade, and growing purchases of oil, have sparked criticism in the West that China was helping to fund Russia’s war.
     
            Western governments and independent analysts also raised alarm that dual-use goods with potential military applications are part of these surging imports.
     
            White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing’s substantial support for Russia’s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.
     
            In a visit to Beijing late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Chinese leaders that the US and other countries would act if Beijing didn’t move to stem this flow.
     
            French President Emmanuel Macron and his European Commission counterpart Ursula von der Leyen also pressed Xi on such supplies during the leader’s state visit to France last week, with Von der Leyen saying after the meeting that “more effort is needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia that find their way to the battlefield.”
     
            Beijing has previously slammed the US as making “groundless accusations” over “normal trade and economic exchanges” between China and Russia. But analysts have pointed to nascent, potential signs that China may be seeking to dial down such imports — with China’s monthly exports to Russia declining in both March and April compared with the same periods in 2023, according to official Chinese customs data.
     
            Xi and Putin’s relationship has also appeared to strengthen as both leaders consolidated power, rewriting previous term limits in recent years to extend their respective lengthy rules.
     
            The war has not changed that dynamic. Putin’s overseas travel has declined since the outbreak of the conflict, but this trip marks his second to China since the invasion and the two leaders’ fourth in-person meeting in that time.
     
            Xi has made a single known phone call to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during that period and met US President Joe Biden in person twice on the sidelines of international summits since Biden took office in 2021.
     
            Xi and Putin have a history of marking milestones together. This week’s visit is Putin’s symbolic first international trip since starting a fifth term in office following his victory in a tightly controlled election in March. It mirrors Xi’s state visit to Russia in March 2023, which was the Chinese leader’s first overseas trip after starting a norm-shattering third term as president.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/us-intelligence-china-iran-deepfakes-2020-election/index.html,"Exclusive: US intelligence spotted Chinese, Iranian deepfakes in 2020 aimed at influencing US voters","Operatives working for the Chinese and Iranian governments prepared fake, AI-generated content as part of a campaign to influence US voters in the closing weeks of the 2020 election campaign, current and former US officials briefed on ...","May 15, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Zachary Cohen,China,"
            Operatives working for the Chinese and Iranian governments prepared fake, AI-generated content as part of a campaign to influence US voters in the closing weeks of the 2020 election campaign, current and former US officials briefed on the intelligence told CNN.
     
            The Chinese and Iranian operatives never disseminated the deepfake audio or video publicly, but the previously unreported intelligence demonstrates concerns US officials had four years ago about the willingness of foreign powers to amplify false information about the voting process.
     
            The National Security Agency collected the intelligence that gave US officials insights into China and Iran’s capabilities in producing deepfakes, one of the sources said.
     
            Now, with deepfake audio and video much easier to produce and the presidential election just six months away, US officials have grown more concerned over how a foreign influence campaign might exploit artificial intelligence to mislead voters.
     
            At an exercise in the White House Situation Room last December in preparation for the 2024 election, senior US officials wrestled with how to respond to a scenario where Chinese operatives create a fake AI-generated video depicting a Senate candidate destroying ballots, as CNN has previously reported.
     
            At a briefing last week, FBI officials warned that AI increases the ability of foreign states to spread election disinformation.
     
            It’s unclear what was depicted in the deepfakes that the Chinese and Iranian operatives prepared in 2020, according to the sources, or why they were not ultimately deployed during that election.
     
            At the time, some US officials who reviewed the intelligence were unimpressed, believing it showed China and Iran lacked the capability to deploy deepfakes in a way that would seriously impact the 2020 presidential election, a former senior US official told CNN.
     
            “The technology has to be good; I don’t think it was that good,” the former official said. “Secondly, you have to have a risk appetite. China, no. Iran, probably yes.”
     
            Sources pointed to no evidence of coordination between the two countries.
     
            The NSA has continued to collect intelligence on foreign adversaries developing deepfakes and the potential threat they pose to US elections now that the technology has advanced dramatically over the last four years, the former senior official added, pointing out that in 2020, there wasn’t, for example, a large language model like ChatGPT that was easy to use.
     
            The NSA declined to comment.
     
            US officials have maintained a high level of visibility into the AI and deepfake advancements made by countries including China, Iran and Russia since the 2020 election. But putting that intelligence to use inside the US remains a challenge, the former official said.

            “The question becomes how quickly can we spot an anomaly and then share that rapidly within the United States,” the former official told CNN. “Are we winning the race against a series of adversaries that might operate within the US? That’s the challenge.”
     
            The threat of deepfakes and foreign influence is poised to come up in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday, when lawmakers will get a rare opportunity to publicly interrogate the director of national intelligence and other senior officials on foreign threats to elections.
     
            “Other adversarial nations know that it is relatively easy and, frankly, cheap to try to interfere in our election,” Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s John Berman Wednesday morning. “I think we should expect China, Russia, Iran, potentially other nation-states to try to both either cyberattack our infrastructure or, more likely, spread misinformation to try to pit Americans against Americans.”
     
            While they didn’t deploy their deepfakes in 2020, Iranian government operatives did undertake a brazen attempt that year to influence voters by imitating the far-right Proud Boys group and disseminating a video purporting to show the hack of a US voter registration database, according to US prosecutors.
     
            “The fact that the Iranians pulled the Proud Boys crap but didn’t try deep fakes was either a lack of faith in the capabilities or a sign of no clear internal guidance,” one person familiar with the intelligence told CNN.
     
            For foreign influence operations to be effective, they also need to resonate with the American public, something China has struggled with, the former senior US official said.
     
            “I think it’s clearly a cultural piece,” the former official said. “They really have a very difficult understanding of the issues that that are divisive or necessarily how to play to those issues, where the Russians do not.”
     
            Generative AI, or AI used to create video, audio, imagery or text, has made foreign influence actors more efficient in creating content, but “there is no evidence that it has made them or their campaigns any more effective,” said Lee Foster, an expert in tracking foreign influence operations online.
     
            “Generative AI has so far not helped actors resolve the main bottleneck they face: distribution,” said Foster, who is a co-founder of AI security firm Aspect Labs. “Actors have rarely struggled with creating content. Getting it in front of the right eyeballs at a meaningful scale has been and continues to be the sticking point, one that AI so far has not helped them overcome.”
     
            Foster and other experts have cautioned against exaggerating the impact of foreign influence operations, including those that use AI, because it benefits the propagandists themselves.
     
            But the US remains fertile ground for conspiracy theories, whether domestic or foreign in origin.
     
            Nearly 70% of Republicans and Republican-leaners said that President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win was not legitimate, according to a CNN poll released in August.
     
            And positive views of many government institutions are “at historic lows,” with just 16% of the public saying they trust the federal government always or most of the time, according to a Pew Research Center survey released in September.
     
            “Americans, for whatever reason, are a lot more willing to believe crazy conspiracy theories and a lot less willing to accept, as truth, things coming from the federal government,” Warner said on CNN Wednesday.
     
            The 2024 US election will present new opportunities for foreign influence operations. US military aid to Ukraine is essentially on the line, with Democrats largely backing Biden’s support for Ukraine and some leading Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, increasingly backing away from foreign aid.
     
            FBI officials are concerned that the war in Ukraine – and US support for Kyiv — might be an “animating event for the Russians” in terms of conducting interference or influence operations aimed at the US election, a senior FBI official told reporters last week.

            US President Joe Biden has quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles from China to 100%, effectively sealing off one of the world’s biggest passenger car markets to the largest global producer of EVs.
     
            “I’m determined that the future of electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers,” Biden said Tuesday. But the real battleground over EVs may lie far beyond US shores — in Europe.
     
            The United States currently buys very few EVs from China. It’s a very different matter in Europe — by far the biggest export market for Chinese EV manufacturers. Washington’s drastic measure piles pressure on the European Union to defend its automakers, which are likely to face even fiercer competition from Chinese EV imports if they’re all but priced out of the United States.
     
            Joseph Webster, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the latest US tariffs on EVs and other goods from China, including semiconductors and batteries, might “force Brussels’ hand” since higher US tariffs could divert much of the trade to Europe.
     
            “Brussels will have to act quickly, either to put its own tariffs in place or to accept a flood of Chinese-made products,” he added in comments on the think tank’s website.
     
            The EU is already investigating state support for Chinese EV makers and, if it finds that their prices are artificially low, it will announce extra import duties by early July. Brussels suspects that subsidies by Beijing may be creating unfair competition for European carmakers.
     
            Agatha Kratz, a director at research provider Rhodium Group, said the hike in US tariffs on Chinese EVs makes it “easier” for the EU to take its tariffs “all the way to 30%,” triple their current level.
     
            But it would be “very hard” for Brussels to match US tariffs, she told CNN. The EU “can’t justify going much higher (than 30%) as the duties need to be aligned with the findings of the investigation on the scale of subsidization in China.”
     
            “This means that the EU will need to explore other tools and defensive instruments to try and stem the flow of China-made EVs coming into Europe,” she added. They could include measures targeting data security, and strict enforcement of environmental and labor standards.
     
            According to Citi, the EU accounted for 36% of Chinese EV exports last year, more than the next five largest markets combined. By contrast, the United States currently receives just 1.1% of China’s EV exports. That amounts to less than $365 million, according to consultancy Capital Economics.
     
            Chinese brands enjoy much lower production costs than their European rivals. This means that duties of 40% to 50% would probably be necessary “to make the European market unattractive for Chinese EV exporters,” Kratz and other researchers at Rhodium Group argue.
     
            For BYD, China’s biggest EV maker, the tariffs would likely have to be even higher to be effective, they add. Duties at such levels are unlikely, however, according to Rhodium Group.

            That’s also because they could ultimately hurt European automakers, many of which manufacture cars in China that they then sell in Europe.
     
            On an earnings call with reporters last week, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse warned Europe to proceed with caution.
     
            “We don’t think that our industry needs protection,” he later told analysts, adding that operating on a global basis is an advantage. “You can easily endanger that advantage by introducing import tariffs.”
     
            The EU will also want to avoid provoking retaliation from Beijing, which could make life difficult for European carmakers selling in China.
     
            “The EU’s situation is very different than the US… since the German automakers rely so heavily on the China market for significant sales (and) profits,” said Tu Le, managing director at Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. “That makes the chances of (the EU) doing something heavy-handed very low.”
     
            Biden’s tariffs speak to a growing sense of urgency among Western officials to prevent domestic jobs and strategically important industries from being wiped out by cheap Chinese imports.
     
            As a trade partner, China is more important to the EU than to the United States — crucially, it represents a much bigger market for EU goods exports. Nonetheless, Brussels is taking a more protective stance on trade.
     
            In addition to the probe into Chinese EVs, the EU is investigating alleged dumping of industrial products by China or unfair state support for Chinese makers of wind turbines.

            “The EU is using its whole toolbox at the moment to defend its economy and European jobs from what it perceives to be unfair trade practices from China,” said Kratz from Rhodium Group, who suggested the EU and China are already engaged in a low-level trade war.
     
            “I’d say we are entering a very tense period in terms of trade interactions and trade defense,” she added.
     
            The United States may also pressure the EU and other allies to reduce their reliance on trade with China, as it has successfully done with semiconductors.
     
            In a statement announcing the tariffs Tuesday, the White House said it would continue to work with allies “to strengthen cooperation to address shared concerns about China’s unfair practices.”
     
            Leaders from the Group of Seven developed economies will discuss how to protect their industries from Chinese competition at a summit in Italy next month.
     
            “The next few weeks will be telling,” said Josh Lipsky, a senior director at the Atlantic Council. “If Europe and the G7 countries match or mirror US policies… it may cause Beijing to realize that this time is different,” he wrote in comments Tuesday.
     
            “On the other hand, if Europe hedges (its bets), coming out of its own anti-dumping review, it could affirm China’s view that their challenge is primarily with the United States, not the rest of the advanced economies.”

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping will welcome Vladimir Putin to China on Thursday for the Russian president’s second visit in less than a year – the latest sign of their growing alignment amid hardening global fault lines as conflict devastates Gaza and Russia makes advances in Ukraine.
     
            Putin will arrive in China just over a week since entering a new term in office, extending his autocratic rule until 2030 – the result of an election without any true opposition.
     
            His visit, set to take place May 16-17, according to Chinese state media, mirrors Xi’s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president – like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve.
     
            Their meeting comes months ahead of the American presidential elections and as Washington faces mounting international backlash over its support for Israel’s war on Gaza. It’s set to provide a platform for the leaders to discuss how all this can advance their shared ambition to degrade and offer an alternative to American power.
     
            The visit also comes as the two leaders operate within what observers say is a loose but growing coordination of interests between avowedly anti-American countries Iran and North Korea. Pyongyang – which has an economy almost entirely dependent of China – is believed by Western governments to be aiding Russia with war supplies. So too, the US says, is Tehran, which is being bolstered economically by Russia and China and is a powerful player in the conflict in the Middle East.
     
            Putin will arrive for the two-day state visit emboldened by the survival of his wartime economy and amid a major new offensive along key points of the front line in Ukraine. For Xi, freshly returned from a European tour, the visit is an opportunity to showcase that his allegiance to Putin has not broken his ability to engage with the West.
     
            In an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua published Wednesday ahead of his travel, Putin hailed the “great prospects” of the countries’ partnership and their joint efforts to “strengthen the sovereignty, protect the territorial integrity and security of our countries.”
     
            The leaders aimed to deepen cooperation in “industry and high-tech, outer space and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and other innovative sectors,” Putin added.
     
            But the optics of the strident allegiance belie a more challenging picture.
     
            Pressure is mounting on Beijing from Washington over its alleged support for Russia’s defense industry. In Europe, Xi had to navigate sharp tensions in France – only welcomed with fanfare in Serbia and Hungary, while China’s key partner, Russia, remains isolated on the world stage.
     
            Xi has ramped up his calls for Europe and other countries to help the world avoid a “Cold War,” suggesting they resist what Beijing sees as US efforts to contain China.
     
            But the leader himself – including as he hosts Putin this week – is seen to be tightening relationships to underscore a growing global split that could deepen divisions with the West, whose technology and investment, experts say, China needs.
     
            “We live in a more dangerous world, authoritarian powers are increasingly aligned. Russia is receiving support for its war of aggression from China, Iran and North Korea,” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned last month.
     
            “This reminds us that security is not regional, security is global. And we must work with our like-minded partners around the world to preserve and protect transatlantic security.”
     
            Looming over Xi’s meeting with Putin this week are Western threats of more sweeping actions against his country if it continues sending certain goods to Russia. The US government says dual-use exports are enabling Russia to build up its defense industry.
     
            “The pressures are arguably bigger than they were in the past two years,” said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, pointing to a new raft of sanctions from the US earlier this month targeting Chinese firms – and the potential for more, including from the EU.
     
            China has said it closely monitors exports of dual-use goods and denies its trade with Russia is anything outside of normal bilateral exchange. Bilateral trade between the two countries reached a record $240 billion last year.

            Even close observers of Xi’s opaque decision-making are divided on whether all this means the Chinese leader will seek to use his time with Putin this week to advocate for a settlement in the conflict soon.
     
            But China’s official trade data from March and April both show declines in exports to Russia compared with the same periods the previous year – indicating Beijing may be taking steps to protect against Western sanctions hitting deeper into its commercial and financial sectors.
     
            Any recalibration there, however, is unlikely to stem deepening of cooperation across a range of areas between the two countries, who hold regular military drills and diplomatic exchanges. It’s also unlikely to change Beijing’s bottom line when it comes to Russia’s war, analysts say.
     
            “Russia is fundamental to China’s grand strategy,” said Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in Bangalore. While Beijing doesn’t want escalation, “there is a deep interest in making sure that Russia doesn’t lose the war,” he said.
     
            The war in Gaza — also expected to be a touchpoint in Xi and Putin’s discussions — has opened opportunity for the two countries’ shared goals, analysts say.
     
            Those goals, broadly speaking, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov put it during a joint presser with his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing last month, include establishing a “fair multipolar world order” free from American “hegemony and neo-colonial” practices, as well as working together to “consolidate the nations of the Global South.”
     
            When it comes to Gaza, both powers have declined to condemn Hamas for its October 7 terror attack on Israel. They have also criticized Israel and the United States – converging with mounting global backlash, especially across the Global South against Israel’s war. More than 35,000 have died in Gaza during the war, according to the health ministry there, and a mass humanitarian worsens with every week.
     
            China has limited hard influence in the region, while Russia has had some level of presence, but “they see each other as force multipliers,” said Kewalramani in Bangalore, referring to the overlap in their response to this conflict.
     
            The conflict has also impacted how China and Russia view their relations with countries there, he added. That includes with Iran, which in the past year joined two Beijing and Moscow-founded international groups, BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
     
            “They see Iran as part of the new order (they are working to create), whereas they see Israel as a proxy for the United States … that has become much sharper since October 7,” he said.
     
            But as Xi continues to strengthen his relationship with Putin and Russia in an increasingly fractured world, this also raises questions – including from within China’s policy circles and the public sphere – about where that leads the world’s second largest economy.
     
            Unlike internationally isolated Russia or Iran, China is still viewed throughout the West as an important player and potential partner on global issues like climate change, despite concerns about its human rights record and aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan.
     
            “Chinese like me feel shameful to receive Vladimir Putin, because his country defies the UN charter … (and is viewed by) 141 countries as an aggressor,” said Shanghai-based international scholar Shen Dingli. China “wants to use Russia” for its aims, but Russia is making China weak, he said.
     
            Popular suspicions and concerns about Russia were on show in China earlier this month, when an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo was set up in the name of prominent Russian ultranationalist thinker Alexander Dugin.

            Social media users flocked to the unverified page, where some voices called for Ukrainian victory and others pointed to the two countries’ historical frictions, with one user comment that received hundreds of likes calling for Moscow to return lands in the Russian Far East ceded to the Russian empire in the 19th century.
     
            CNN was unable to confirm if the account, which garnered more than 100,000 followers, was authentic.
     
            Some observers argue that historical mistrust – linked to border tensions only formally resolved in the early 2000s and China’s Cold War realignment with the US – mean even Xi and Putin’s close relations are transactional in the face of shared tensions with the West – or at least lacking trust within their broader government ranks.
     
            All this comes into great focus ahead of the upcoming US elections, where the outcome could have a sweeping impact on the future of the war in Ukraine and US engagement with China – with the re-election of former president Donald Trump perhaps playing to Russia’s benefit.
 
            “We know some Chinese policy analysts would quietly, privately make the argument that is despite American pressures on China and geopolitical contestations in the past few years … China could have maintained slightly better relations with the US and the West, at the same time, could have avoided developing relationship with Russia to the extent that is so close today,” said Li in Singapore.
     
            But in Xi’s China there appears to be little space for such questions.
     
            Instead, the summit this week is poised to underline the strength of the partnership – and an opportunity for both to check in on an aspiration Xi voiced to Putin during his state visit to Moscow just over a year ago.
     
            There, he proclaimed that “changes that have not happened for 100 years” were afoot. “Together, we should push (these changes) forward,” he said.

            Countries have long imposed tariffs as a means of protecting and shoring up domestic industries.
     
            However, history and research have shown that the economic effects often fail to live up to the hype.
     
            On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced the latest iteration of American import taxes: a wave of new and heightened tariffs on Chinese exports across a slew of industries deemed strategic to national security.
     
            Economists expect that the newly announced $18 billion in tariffs likely will have a minimal near-term impact on GDP, inflation and monetary policy — some equating it to a mere “rounding error.” However, on a broader level, the picture could be more complex.
     
            “The tariffs announced on China by the Biden administration foreshadow what is going to be a long, cold winter of economic conflict between the US and China,” economist Joe Brusuelas at RSM US told CNN.
     
            The latest tariffs build upon former President Donald Trump’s sweeping $300 billion program in 2018 and 2019, which levied tariffs heavily against China and a variety of other trading partners and is still in effect.
     
            Trump has made campaign trail promises for even steeper tariffs if he were elected — not just for China but an across-the-board 10% tariff on all imports, which economists have said would not only result in significant job losses in the US but also stoke inflation.
     
            The latest tariffs, which would roll out some time between now and 2026, come amid a solid job market, robust economic growth and strong consumer spending — but also a continuing battle against decades-high inflation that is keeping interest rates higher.
     
            Biden’s tariff plan likely won’t move the needle for monetary policy, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
     
            “The additional tariffs are essentially a rounding error for inflation and GDP, carrying no implications for monetary policy,” Sweet wrote in a note issued Monday, when reports first indicated that changes to the US tariff policy were forthcoming. “The Fed will not make a mountain out of a mole hill, so the tariffs will not provide additional ammunition to justify keeping interest rates high for longer.”
     
            On Tuesday, after learning the fuller scope of the Biden administration’s tariffs, Sweet told CNN those expectations shouldn’t change significantly.
     
            In 2002, when President George W. Bush placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, studies show that while it only cost the economy $30 million, it resulted in higher prices for American steel-consuming industries and led to a steep loss of jobs throughout the steel industry, especially among smaller firms that didn’t have the market power to influence prices.
     
            Seven years later, when President Barack Obama increased tariffs on tires imported from China, the initiative was credited with saving about 1,200 jobs in the US tire manufacturing industry, but came at a $1.1 billion cost to Americans in the form of higher prices, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found.
     
            The 2018 tariffs imposed by Trump did not result in an immediate boost to manufacturing employment but instead led to a net loss of jobs and rising prices for consumers due to higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs, Federal Reserve economists noted in a 2019 paper.
     
            Tariffs typically make more political sense than economic sense, Sweet noted.
     
            “Most economists view tariffs as a bad idea because they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization, disrupt the movement of goods and services, and lead to a misallocation of resources,” Sweet wrote. “Consumers and producers often pay higher prices when tariffs are implemented.”

            That’s because tariffs tax imports when they come ashore, adding costs for US distributors, retailers and, ultimately, consumers.
     
            The US International Trade Commission said in a 2023 study that US importers “bore nearly the full cost” of the Trump tariffs.
     
            Worse, some businesses appeared to take advantage of the trade war by bumping up prices even higher.
     
            Goldman Sachs found that tariffs allowed US producers and non-Chinese exporters to the US market to “opportunistically raise their prices as well.”
     
The New York Fed found that the 2018 tariffs cost US households $419 per year because of higher tax burdens and market efficiency losses. Researchers estimated that would double as the tariffs went into effect in 2019.
     
            As more time has passed, the positive economic effects have become even less clear cut.
     
            The net economic effect of the import tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies “was at best a wash, and it may have been mildly negative,” to US jobs and businesses, economists wrote in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published in January 2024.
     
            The trade war did appear to have political benefits in strengthening support for the Republican party in the US heartland and communities most affected by the tariffs, researchers noted in the NBER working paper.
     
            “Residents of tariff-protected locations became less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to vote for President Trump,” they wrote. “Voters thus appear to have responded favorably to the extension of tariff protections to local industries despite their economic cost.”
     
            The Covid-19 pandemic’s discombobulating effects on supply chains distort the full picture of how the 2018-2019 tariffs affected US manufacturing and trade.
     
            US importers had started to substitute away from Chinese goods, but once the pandemic struck and US consumer demand increased, domestic inventory levels drew down quickly and China imports ramped back up, Wells Fargo economists wrote in an April note.

            However, by the end of 2023, imports from China were down 3% relative to 2019 while there was a 50% growth in imports from South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.
     
            “There’s definitely some data to suggest that we’ve seen stronger imports from countries outside of China, and some of it may be that Chinese businesses are perhaps relocating some of their operations to these other countries that are not being affected by the Section 301 tariffs,” Cervi said.
     
            Recent ocean and air freight data gives further rise to suspicions that China may be trying to circumvent US tariffs via Mexico, said Peter Sand, chief analyst with Xeneta, an ocean and air freight analytics and logistics company.
     
            Container shipping imports from China to Mexico rocketed higher by 60% in January and 34% for the first quarter, Xeneta data shows.
     
            “That’s a lot,” Sand told CNN in an interview. “It’s staggering.”
     
            What was once an immature trade lane is now one of the busiest in the world, he said.
     
            “It’s obvious that imports to this extent are not only for domestic purposes in Mexico,” he said.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/biden-tariffs-chinese-imports/index.html,Biden increases tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports in a new warning to Beijing,President Joe Biden is increasing tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security – an attempt to cripple Beijing’s development of critical technologies and instead prioritize US production.,"May 14, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Kayla Tausche,China,"
President Joe Biden is increasing tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security – an attempt to cripple Beijing’s development of critical technologies and instead prioritize US production.
     
            The increases will apply to imported steel and aluminum, legacy semiconductors, electric vehicles, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products. The new tariff rates – which range from 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% for solar components, to 25% for all other sectors – will take place over the next two years.
     
            “China’s using the same playbook it has before to power its own growth at the expense of others,” said Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “China’s simply too big to play by its own rules.”
     
            Announcing the new tariffs during a speech in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Biden said he seeks “fair competition with China, not conflict.”
     
            “The fact is, American workers can out-work and out-compete anyone, as long as the competition is fair,” Biden said. “For too long, it hasn’t been fair.”
     
            Biden’s predecessor, former President Donald Trump, enacted a sweeping tariff program on $300 billion in Chinese imports during his administration, drawing authority from a provision in US trade law that allows tariffs to be used to stifle competition that would threaten national security interests. That same trade law also requires the effectiveness of such tariff programs to be evaluated every four years, and the Biden administration decision is the result of that study. CNN previously reported on the forthcoming changes.
     
            White House officials said they also redrew the parameters of the program to reflect the Biden administration’s policy priorities, most notably the transition to clean energy.
     
            “China can’t be the only country that produces clean technology for the world we need,” a senior administration official said. “We need diversified, not concentrated, production of our most critical goods and technologies. … That’s the kind of dynamic we think will produce resilient supply chains and clean technology.”
     
            Electric vehicles imported from China will see their tariffs more than quadrupled from 27.5% to 100% – a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing’s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports.
     
            “We’re not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automobile manufacturers to compete fairly,” Biden said on Tuesday.
     
            He added, “Folks, look, I’m determined that the future of electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers, period.”
     
            Chinese manufacturer BYD’s Seagull electric vehicle retails for roughly $10,000, a fraction of what rival American products cost.
     
            “It was important to have a large enough step-up in the tariffs to ensure that we try to level the playing field,” a second senior administration official said.
     
            Beijing has been known to introduce costly counterpunches. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday that China opposes “the unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.”
     
            After Trump unveiled his wide-ranging tariff policy, China slapped tariffs on $101.4 billion in US exports, retaliation that the Brookings Institute estimated affected 294,000 American export-related jobs.
     
            Biden acknowledged Tuesday that he expects China will likely retaliate in some way to the newly announced tariffs against Beijing.
     
            “It’s about saving American jobs,” Biden said in an interview with Yahoo Finance posted Tuesday. “I’m sure China will talk a lot about it, but the fact is that China already is … way over their skis on this. I don’t think it’ll lead to any international conflict or anything like that but I think they’ll probably try to figure out how they can raise tariffs maybe on products that are unrelated.”
     
            Responding to news of the impending tariffs, Trump, speaking outside of the New York courtroom where he is standing trial on Tuesday, suggested Biden should have taken these steps at the beginning of his term.
     
            “China is eating our lunch right now,” Trump said outside the courtroom. Asked to respond to Trump’s statement after he signed the tariffs, Biden said his predecessor has “been feeding them a long time.”
     
            The White House has declined to speculate on how Beijing may hit back now. Officials have pointed to parallel investigations by partners in Europe, Brazil and Turkey as bolstering their position.
     
            “China is producing [goods] at a rate and with a trajectory that’s far in excess of any plausible estimate of global demand,” the first senior administration official said.
     
            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken each raised that point with Chinese counterparts during formal visits to the country in April. Administration officials discussed releasing the changes in April to set the stage for a tariff speech Biden delivered mid-month, but ultimately held off to preserve the diplomatic visits, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
     
            On April 17, Biden spoke at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh, calling for a tripling of tariffs Trump placed on certain steel and aluminum products imported from China, and a new investigation into unfair shipbuilding practices. The Chinese government, Biden argued, is providing state money to Chinese steel companies to make more steel than the economy demands, pushing down the price and making it impossible for other companies to compete.
     
            “They’re not competing,” Biden said of China. “They’re cheating.”
     
            It’s a message that plays favorably across the so-called blue wall, the handful of Midwest manufacturing-heavy states that will be critical for either candidate during an election where trade will once again figure prominently.
     
            It played less favorably across the Pacific, with China’s Ministry of Commerce accusing the US of “false accusations” and “wrong practices.”
     
            In a separate executive order issued on Monday, Biden forced MineOne, a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining company, to sell its land near the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The order said MineOne’s close proximity to the Air Force base raises national security risks due to the company’s use of “specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities.”
     
            The decision comes amid recent attempts by Washington to limit Chinese companies’ influence on US consumers and national security, especially ahead of the 2024 presidential elections in November.

            China has vowed to resolutely defend its interests in the face of huge new US tariffs and warned that the trade barriers would affect the wider relationship between the two economic superpowers.
     
            President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced that tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and an array of other products would soar over the next two years.
     
            The White House said the measures were designed to protect American workers and businesses in the face of China’s unfair trade practices, including “flooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.”
     
            China “firmly opposes” the new tariffs, the country’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

Biden to increase tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports in a new warning to Beijing
 
            “The increase in … tariffs by the United States contradicts President Joe Biden’s commitment to ‘not seek to suppress and contain China’s development’ and ‘not to seek to decouple and break links with China,’” it said. “This action will seriously impact the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation.”
     
            EVs imported from China will see their tariffs more than quadrupled from 27.5% to 100% — a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing’s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports.
     
            In addition to EVs, increased tariffs will apply to imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, legacy semiconductors, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products.
     
            Tariffs on solar cells and semiconductors will double to 50%, while the remainder of the targeted imports will attract tariffs of 25%.
     
            “China opposes the unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday shortly before the widely anticipated White House announcement.

            China’s global trade surplus in goods has soared in recent years and is now approaching $1 trillion, stoking tensions with the United States and Europe.
     
            The Biden administration and European Union officials fear Beijing is trying to tackle a subsidy-fueled overcapacity problem in its decelerating economy by dumping excess products on global markets. Leaders from the Group of Seven developed economies will discuss how to protect their industries at a summit next month.
     
            Responding to a separate question during the briefing, Wang added that the growth of China’s new energy industry — including EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products — is built on “continued technical innovation, complete industrial and supply chains, and full-on market competition.”
     
            “Our leading edge is a result of comparative advantage and the rule of markets combined, not (of) subsidies,” Wang said.

            For decades, Western companies made a fortune betting on the inexorable rise of the Chinese consumer. Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt.
     
            Discounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            One of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival.
     
            Tesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier.
     
            The sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries.
     
            “Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.”
     
            Last month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a series of price reductions that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022.
     
            Last year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
     
            Consumers have curtailed spending as their job and income prospects worsened. A prolonged crisis in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, and a stock market meltdown have added to their woes.

            In the 1990s, “every company in the West” was hiring consultants and having boardroom meetings about how to do more in China, according to Stevenson-Yang. But now the consultants are gone and rather than talking about how to tap into rapid growth, the C-suite discussions are all about “getting out, protecting one’s operations or balancing supply among several countries.”
     
            “China now is somewhere around the status of a Brazil — big, important but difficult,” she added.
     
            The country’s economic woes aren’t confined to Tesla and the EV industry either. They’re hitting other American corporate giants like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (STUX) and McDonald’s (MCD): all struggling to adjust their business strategies for a rapidly changing market.
     
            Worries about the future have forced Chinese consumers to be more budget-conscious, said Yang Wang, senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. As a result, purchases associated with premium or luxury have taken a back seat.
     
            “Certainly Chinese consumers are experiencing ‘downgraded consumption’ in general,” he said.
     
            Apple’s overall revenue in Greater China — including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao — fell 8% to $16.4 billion in the fiscal quarter ending March 30.
     
            Meanwhile, Huawei, a Chinese tech champion that the West once tried to kill off, has been advancing rapidly. Its smartphone sales soared 70% in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the successful launch of its Mate 60 series, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.

            “[China] is the most competitive market in the world,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, at an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. He added that he continues to feel optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term.
     
            The US smartphone maker has cut prices for iPhones sold in China, which helped its shipments jump in March, according to data published last week by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government-backed research firm. It marked a turnaround from the previous two months of 2024, when Apple saw a deep slump in iPhone sales.
     
            The price reductions were led by Apple and third-party retailing platforms, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 20%.
     
            Coffee chains have also scrambled to undercut each other’s prices. Last February, Cotti Coffee, a startup founded by two former Luckin Coffee executives, began a campaign to slash latte prices to as low as 9.9 yuan ($1.4).
     
            The move prompted Luckin, which is the country’s largest coffee chain, to match that price. Cotti then slashed latte prices again to 8.8 yuan ($1.2).
     
            The aggressive discounts have affected global brands. Even Starbucks, which had signalled it had no interest in a price war in China, started offering coupons that effectively lowered its latte prices to below 20 yuan ($2.8). They normally sell for 30 yuan ($4.2).

            The average check paid by a Starbucks customer declined 9% in China in the first quarter of the year, mainly because of promotions and lower sales of higher priced merchandise, the company said.
     
            “Our consumers are now more cautious in their spending,” said Belinda Wong, chairwoman and co-CEO of Starbucks China, on an earnings call in January. “You see mass influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial.”
     
            Fast food chains have also gotten into the act.
     
            “Poor man’s deal” has become a trending term among Chinese youth since 2022. It initially referred to McDonald’s “1+1 = 13.9-yuan pair as you wish” $1.90 set meal, which was extremely popular among customers.
     
            Other Western fast food chains have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon, launching their own low-price set meals.
     
            Online guides for getting weekly fast food discounts have gone viral on social media.
     
            “Mondays at McDonalds for free McNuggets, Tuesdays at Tastien for a ‘one-for-one’ offer, Wednesdays at Dominos for 30% off, Thursdays at KFC for the ‘crazy Thursday’ deal, Fridays at Burger King for a half-priced weekday set deal, then heading to Wallace for the weekends. Repeat next week,” according to one guide.
     
            Nanchengxiang, a Beijing-based fast food chain, has even launched an ultra-cheap “3 yuan (41 cents) breakfast buffet,” setting a record for all-you-can-eat meals.
     
            The set, dubbed by many netizens as “a must-have for poor people working in Beijing,” has more than doubled sales during breakfast hours, according to canyin168, a data tracking and analytical website in the catering industry.
     
            The “depressed” consumer sentiment is likely to stay for a while, said Yang from Counterpoint Research.
     
            Some Western brands “inevitably” will be forced to reconsider pricing to defend market share.
     
            However, that will be “no easy fix,” as foreign brands are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis domestic brands due to higher operating costs, he added.

            He doesn’t think they’re likely to pull out of the country though.
     
            Over the medium to long term, China is still set to drive global economic growth and contribute to the largest growing cohort of middle-class consumers.
     
            “With depressed economic prospects in most developed countries, and still some catching up to do for key emerging market growth markets like India, China could still offer the most lucrative market globally, even with depressed consumption levels,” he said.
     
            But expectations will have to be lowered.
     
            “I think the fundamental mistake that many Western companies made in China was to believe in the myth of a rising middle class,” said Stevenson-Yang.
     
            “In reality, Chinese people had a ton of money from capital gains in real estate and the stock market; They never had big increases in income. The economy is not reverting to the poverty levels of the 1980s, but there is a lot of dialing back being done.”

            A Chinese citizen journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict.
     
            Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage.
     
            She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists.
     
            Zhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups.
     
            Supporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule.
     
            “So far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,” said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign.
     
            “I understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends’ calls are also left without answers… these are extremely worrying signs,” she added.
     
            Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on “the international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,” in a post on social platform X Friday.

            In early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media.
     
            For more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube – the latter two of which are blocked in China.
     
            “I can’t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) ‘rumors,’” she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask.
     
            “Even our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom…If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.”
     
            Her posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai.
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon.
     
            “I don’t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,” said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.
     
            “At the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,” he added.
     
            Human rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison.
     
            “While Zhang is released from prison, it won’t mean she will be free,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House.
     
            “If the Chinese government’s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan’s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.”
     
            Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang’s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted.
     
            “Zhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,” she said.
     
            “The Chinese government’s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.”
     
            Supporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang’s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison.
     
            The 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang’s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care.
     
            During a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture.
     
            China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang’s mistreatment in detention.
     
            In a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who “exercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet” during the pandemic.
     
            “In China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,” the statement said. “The Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.”
     
            Zhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing’s response as effective and timely.
     
            China is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index.
     
            Authorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.

            China has “panda diplomacy,” Australia parades koalas at global summits and now Malaysia plans to join the Asia-Pacific trend for adorable ambassadors – by gifting orangutans to countries that buy its palm oil.
     
            But the idea has come under heavy criticism from conservationists, who note that palm oil has been one of the biggest factors behind the great apes’ dwindling numbers – with one leading conservation professor calling the plan “obscene.”
     
            The world’s most widely consumed vegetable oil, palm oil is used in everything from shampoo and soaps to ice cream. Clearing land for palm oil plantations has been a major driver of deforestation, the greatest threat to the survival of critically endangered orangutans.
     
            Malaysia is the world’s second-biggest exporter of palm oil after Indonesia.

            Production is vital to the economy and government officials have gone to great lengths in recent years to defend and rebrand the industry by introducing initiatives to support sustainability – such as improving agricultural practices and issuing government-endorsed green certificates to companies that meet sustainability standards.
     
            At a biodiversity summit outside the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, Malaysia’s minister for plantations and commodities announced plans for “orangutan diplomacy.” Hoping to emulate Chinese panda diplomacy – in which Beijing exerts soft power by loaning its beloved national animal to zoos overseas - the Malaysian government hopes to gift orangutans to some of its biggest trading partners, he said.
     
            Those partners “are increasingly concerned over the impact of agricultural commodities on the climate,” said minister Johari Abdul Ghani. “It is a diplomatic strategy where it would be advantageous to trading partners and foreign relations, especially in major importing countries like the EU, India and China.”
     
            Ghani did not provide further details such as a timeline or how the animals would be acquired – but welcomed palm oil giants to “collaborate” with local environmental groups in caring for the endangered giant apes.
     
            “This will be a manifestation of how Malaysia conserves wildlife species and maintains the sustainability of our forests, especially in the palm oil plantation industry,” he said.
     
            The announcement drew swift backlash from conservationists and environmental groups.
     
            “It is obscene, repugnant and extraordinarily hypocritical to destroy rainforests where orangutans live, take them away and give them as gifts to curry favor with other nations,” Stuart Pimm, chair of conservation ecology at Duke University, told CNN. “It totally goes against how we should be protecting them and our planet.”
     
            Pimm also noted that cuddly-animal charm offensives were normally followed by wider long-term conservation efforts.
     
            “There is a huge difference between what Malaysia is proposing and what China has done for giant pandas,” he said. “China has state-of-the-art facilities for pandas and more importantly, has established protected areas that safeguard wild panda populations. What Malaysia’s government is proposing is hardly anything comparable.”
     
            CNN has reached out to Ghani, and Malaysia’s Ministry of Plantation and Commodities, for further comment about the proposed orangutan program and how it plans to ensure that it will support conservation and sustainability.
     
            Environmental and conservation groups also strongly opposed the idea, calling on Malaysian officials to instead work on reversing deforestation rates, which they largely blame on palm oil.
     
            Between 2001 and 2019, the country lost more than 8 million hectares (19 million acres) of tree cover, according to a 2022 report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), an area nearly as large as South Carolina.

            “Malaysia’s land surface area was once almost covered with forest,” the WWF said in its forestry report, which cited enduring threats such as palm oil cultivation and unsustainable logging.
     
            According to a 2023 report by climate watchdog Rimba Watch, 2.3 million hectares of forests in Malaysia are at threat of deforestation. “Deforestation for palm oil in Malaysia has generally been on a downward trend but still represents a significant driver of deforestation,” Adam Farhan, the group’s director, told CNN. “We believe there is an urgent need to bring deforestation rates in Malaysia to zero rather than co-opt an endangered species as a commodity for diplomacy,” he added.
     
            Heng Kiah Chun, a regional campaign strategist for Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said orangutan diplomacy “would not solve Malaysia’s deforestation crisis.” “If the Malaysian government is truly committed to biodiversity conservation, it should implement policies against deforestation instead,” Heng told CNN.
     
            Orangutans are the largest tree-dwelling animals, known to spend most of their lives swinging through canopies of tropical rainforests.
     
            Researchers have noted their incredible intelligence and ability to demonstrate skills such as instinctively treating wounds with medicinal herbs or using tree branches, sticks and stones as tools to break open hard objects like nuts.

            The gentle apes, once found in greater numbers across Southeast Asia, have experienced sharp population declines, according to a WWF Malaysia report – particularly on Borneo, the large island shared between Malaysia, Indonesia and the tiny sultanate of Brunei.
     
            “In 1973, Borneo was home to an estimated 288,500 orangutans. By 2012, their numbers had dropped by almost two-thirds, to 104,700 and the decline has continued,” the WWF report said.
     
            There are still believed to be around 100,000 orangutans left on Borneo, and 14,000 on Indonesia’s Sumatra island, it added. “Orangutans are critically endangered,” WWF Malaysia told CNN in a statement. “Therefore it is crucial that all remaining orangutan habitats are conserved.”
     
            A commitment to improving forest management and the sustainable production of palm oil would be “the best way to showcase Malaysia’s commitment to biodiversity conservation,” WWF Malaysia said.
     
            “Orangutan conservation is best achieved by ensuring the protection and conservation of their natural habitats – and that no further forest conversion into palm oil plantations is allowed.”

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/china/china-xi-jinping-europe-putin-intl-hnk/index.html,China’s Xi Jinping highlights Europe’s divisions ahead of expected Putin visit,"Xi Jinping ended his European trip by projecting a stark message: that despite frictions with much of the continent, China still has fans in some European capitals.","May 13, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
            Xi Jinping may have started his recent European trip by fielding tough questions in France about trade and Russia’s war in Ukraine, but the Chinese leader ended the sojourn late last week by projecting a stark message: that despite frictions with much of the continent, China still has fans in some European capitals.
     
            Beijing’s pulling power was on show in Belgrade and Budapest, where streets were festooned with Chinese flags. As Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan touched down at both cities’ airports, folk dancers performed on the tarmac and, in contrast to the subdued welcome the couple received in Paris, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were on hand to greet them.
     
            Chinese state media played up the warm diplomacy, with headlines proclaiming China’s “ironclad” bond with Serbia and “golden friendship” with Hungary. Both countries, major recipients of Chinese investment, announced upgrades of their relations with China during the visits – a symbolic win for Xi that analysts say could play a role softening European policy on China in fraught areas such as trade, security and human rights.
     
            But in the rest of Europe, the red-carpet welcome afforded Xi by Vucic and Orban – both widely seen as illiberal and Russia-friendly – may not play as well, analysts say, and emphasizes the shrinking number of European capitals where Xi would meet such a warm embrace.
     
            China-Europe relations have been frayed by the European Union’s growing list of economic grievances with China, which could yet spiral into a full-blown trade war. Also in the mix are suspicions across Europe about Beijing’s global ambitions and influence, especially over its support for Russia – including allegations it is supplying dual-use parts which help the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.
     
            Making his first visit to Europe in five years, Xi was pressed on these issues early last week by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are sure to closely watch any summit between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, expected to happen soon.
     
            In Paris, Xi stressed that China was playing no role other than “contributing to reaching peace” in Ukraine, and denied there was industrial “overcapacity” in China flooding the European market.
     
            Such tensions vanished when Xi met Vucic and Orban.
     
            His visits to Serbia and Hungary “send a very good message to a Chinese (domestic) audience that ‘we have close friends in Europe… Hungary and Serbia are real friends that we can do business with,’” said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, speaking at an event hosted by the center as Xi’s tour got underway last week.
     
            But the countries’ inclusion in his itinerary was “embarrassing” for Paris, because both Orban and Vucic attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing last October alongside Putin, Le Corre added.
     
            Xi’s visits to Serbia and Hungary helped him toward another goal – chipping away at a world order he sees as dominated by the United States.
     
            With the inking of a joint statement, Serbia’s Vucic became the first European leader to commit to joining China in building a “community with a shared future.” The loosely formulated concept calls for a collaboration on shared interests, suggesting countries shouldn’t interact based on alliances, or be judged on their domestic politics and human rights record.
     
            “That is the highest level of cooperation of two countries and I am proud that as a president of Serbia I had an opportunity to sign that declaration with President Xi,” Vucic said Wednesday of the accord, which came alongside a free-trade agreement and other pledges from Xi on expanding agricultural imports and direct flights.
     
            Xi also marketed a shared worldview during his meeting with Orban in Hungary, which is a member of both the EU and NATO. Orban, whose increasingly authoritarian rule has raised alarm within the EU, defied mounting concerns within both blocs to upgrade his country’s relations to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.”

            As well as being another symbolic win for Xi, this could encourage Orban to push back against efforts within the EU to “derisk” supply chains and slap tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts say. Speaking in Budapest Thursday alongside Orban, Xi appeared to allude to that, saying he hoped Hungary would use its rotating EU presidency beginning in July to “promote the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations.”
     
            The two leaders also signed some 18 cooperation agreements, which Orban said covered sectors such as railways, IT, and nuclear energy. Xi declared the two countries would “deepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation” and advance “key projects,” including the Budapest-Belgrade railway.
     
            Both Serbia and Hungary are already key destinations for Chinese investment, with Hungary emerging as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including electric vehicle (EV) makers. In France earlier this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists that Chinese company BYD was “welcome” to open a factory in France; but the EV giant appears to have already chosen its first foothold for car production in Europe, pledging late last year to open a plant in Hungary.
     
            Beijing may also be hoping other countries on the continent take note, with analysts saying all this plays into Xi’s efforts to frame parts of Europe as benefiting from clearheaded views on China, versus others who are mimicking American efforts to contain it.
     
            “Being close to these countries fits China’s domestic narrative that there are ‘smart countries’ in Europe who really understand China and do not support the United States – and China is working with these countries for the good of Europe,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at Hong Kong’s City University.
     
            But Xi’s itinerary also underscores his limitations within Europe, others say, including in Central and Eastern Europe where Beijing previously made extensive efforts to deepen connections and win goodwill, including through Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure drive.
     
            A Chinese mechanism to bolster relations with 16 Central and Eastern European nations has slowly lost support, in part because investments didn’t materialize at the expected scale, and also because China’s support for Russia soured relations in a region with a recent history of Soviet domination.
     
            “The unlimited partnership and Beijing’s moral and material support to Moscow has infuriated many (Central and Eastern European) countries’ leadership and population,” said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “This has definitely weakened China’s position in Europe.”

            Meanwhile, longstanding tensions with Nordic countries and Italy’s exit earlier this year from the Belt and Road, as well as recent visits to China by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meant none of those countries were ideal for Xi to visit, Matura added. France, he said, was likely seen by Beijing as creating a potential for a diplomatic opening given its advocacy for Europe’s strategic autonomy from the US.
     
            But there were few tangible signs from the trip that friction with Western European countries and the EU would abate, despite both Macron and Von der Leyen stressing the importance of dialogue and Xi’s two-day visit with the French president, which included a more personal trip to the Pyrenees and the signing of 18 cooperation deals.
     
            And despite their limited economic heft – with 16 million people between them, and a combined GDP about a tenth of France’s, according to IMF figures – Serbia and EU member Hungary may become increasingly valuable to Beijing as tensions with the bloc continue, and the threat of a trade war looms.
     
            “Orban and Vucic are both the kind of illiberal leaders who are positioning their countries between the rivaling geo-political blocs, hoping to avoid too strong dependence on any one of them,” said former Hungarian member of Parliament Gabor Scheiring, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Georgetown University in Qatar. “They don’t care about democracy or human rights. For them, foreign policy is strictly pragmatically about economic interests.”
     
            And that could be a boon for China.
     
            “Hungary and Serbia are strategic gateways for Beijing toward Europe…  the value of the two countries as gateways to Europe will increase as the trade war escalates,” he said.

            A Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job.
     
            Qu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, often dubbed China’s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure.
     
            In a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports.
     
            In one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines.
     
            “Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law,” Qu said. “I’m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn’t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can’t stand it?”
     
            In another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son’s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn’t regret it because she “chose to become a career woman.”
     
            “If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,” she said in a third video. “Keep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.”
     
            In another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn’t get another job in the industry.
     
            The American Psychological Association describes “toxic workplace” as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity.
     
            Following the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company.
     
            Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of “Baidu’s vice president” from her account on Douyin.
     
            Qu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu.
     
            The controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China’s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of promoting a toxic workplace.
     
            “In her voice and in her tone, there’s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,” said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy.
     
            “A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,” she said.
     
            “This is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,” Yang added.
     
            China’s young workers have increasingly spoken out against the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector.
     
            In 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the “996” trend, meaning working from 9am to 9pm six days a week, and calling it a “huge blessing.”
     
            Yang called the backlash against Ma a “watershed moment” that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves — a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows.
     
            China’s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems — including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — are piling up.
     
            “When companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there’s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,” Yang added.
     
            As public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu’s personal Douyin account were taken down.
     
            After days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for “causing such a big storm” in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China’s most popular social media app.
     
            “I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,” Qu wrote.
     
            She also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company’s stance.
     
            “There were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company’s values and culture, causing serious harm,” Qu wrote.
     
            A person familiar with the matter said Qu’s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu’s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China.

            Qu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity.
     
            “The main purpose is to improve everyone’s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,” said the person, referring to Qu’s English name.
     
            Qu worked as a reporter for China’s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging “wolf culture,” where employees are expected to emulate wolves’ bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience.
     
            Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously said in interviews that its corporate culture was misunderstood. “Wolf culture,” he has said, meant “sensitivity, team spirit and resilience” and that the company didn’t have a “996 culture.”
     
            A former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei’s “aggressive” corporate culture with her to Baidu.
     
            “(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,” the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity.
     
            The PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said.
     
            Qu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be “disciplined” and “able to win battles,” the former employee said.
     
            CNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.

            Two major cities in China have eliminated all remaining curbs on home-buying, in yet another sign that local governments are trying to revive the beleaguered real estate sector and spur growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            Hangzhou, a city of 12.5 million which is home to tech giant Alibaba and EV maker Geely, has been relaxing restrictions in the property market since early 2022. Last October it removed curbs in most districts, and in March loosened restrictions on purchases of second homes.
     
            Now it’s going a step further. Starting from May 9, the city will no longer check the social security records or the “hukou” household registration status of potential buyers, among other qualifications, according to a statement released by Hangzhou Housing Security and Real Estate Administration on Thursday.
     
            Under China’s hukou system, each citizen is required to have only one registered place of residence, determining their access to welfare and other public services.
     
            Xi’an, a northwestern city with a population of 13 million, announced a similar move Thursday.
     
            Other cities have also taken major steps to make the process of buying property easier.
     
            Chengdu, home to 21.4 million residents, announced last week that it will completely scrap restrictions on home purchases starting from April 29. It would no longer review the eligibility of potential homebuyers, including their household registration status, social security payments, or other conditions. No restrictions would be imposed on how many homes people can buy, it said.
     
            Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province,  has also lifted home purchase curbs since last month.
     
            China’s property market has been in crisis since 2020, when the government cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers to rein in their high debt. The crackdown led to the eventual collapse of Evergrande, once the nation’s second largest homebuilder. Other big developers have since become insolvent and millions of apartments have been left unfinished.
     
            Beijing has scrambled to contain the crisis, which has become a major drag on the economy and sparked nationwide protests by homebuyers.
     
            But the stimulus measures rolled out so far, including a series of mortgage rate cuts and piecemeal measures to relax home purchase curbs, have failed to revive the sector as demand has remained weak.

            Last week, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of China’s Communist Party, pledged to explore new measures to tackle the housing crisis, including implementing “city-specific” policies to reduce housing inventory.
     
            But a UBS survey on Wednesday said that Chinese people’s home purchase intensions remain tepid.
     
            The share of respondents planning to buy a house in the next two years stayed weak at 23%, the same level as in March 2023, the survey said. The share of respondents having no plan at all to buy a home reached 47%, an all-time high.
     
            Respondents identified income growth and policy measures, such as rate cuts and government subsidies, as the most important factors in boosting confidence.
     
            “Looking forward, job promotion and salary increase remain the top factor that may boost confidence for those with weaker sentiment,” the survey said.
     
            The analysts expect the government might try to orchestrate a bail out of the sector soon by allowing local authorities to buy empty properties.
     
            “The April Politburo meeting set a more supportive tone for the property sector, prioritizing the reduction of existing home inventory,” they said.
     
            “This may suggest that more local governments may be allowed to purchase homes directly from the market for social housing purposes.”

            At least two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in China’s southwestern province of Yunnan on Tuesday, local authorities said.
     
            The attack took place just before midday at Chengnan Hospital in Zhenxiong, the county’s public security bureau said in a statement.
     
            A 40-year-old man was arrested and the case is under investigation, local police said.
     
            Authorities said they do not know the motive for the attack.
     
            The alleged attacker’s cousin said he had previously been jailed for three years for injuring others in a dispute over a motorcycle transaction, according to the state-owned Henan Daily.
     
            “Before he was imprisoned, his character was still good. He used to behave well. But after he came out…he felt that he had been wronged,” the cousin was quoted as saying.
     
            The report has since been deleted from Chinese news platforms, where censors routinely scrub content.
     
            Another report from the Cover News, a state-owned media outlet, confirmed the suspect was sentenced to three years in jail for “intentional injury” in 2013, citing a court document.
     
            China, where private gun ownership is illegal is for most civilians, has faced a spate of mass stabbings in public places in recent years.
     
            Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning knife attack outside a kindergarten in southern China’s Guangdong. A 2020 knife attack at an elementary school injured 37 children and two adults in the southern Guangxi region, while a 2022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injuring six in eastern Jiangxi province.
     
            Yunnan was also the location of a 2014 knife attack at a train station in the provincial capital of Kunming, where multiple assailants killed 33 people and wounded 133. Authorities blamed terrorists from its Northwestern region of Xinjiang for that attack.
     
            Violence at hospitals is also not unheard of in China, where health professionals have a history of facing assault from patients or their families, often over concerns about high costs and standard of treatment.

            Mount Everest isn’t the only peak in the world experiencing overcrowding.
     
            Earlier this week, groups of travelers climbing Yandang Mountain in eastern China were stuck partway up a cliff, clinging to a rope along a fixed climbing route, for more than an hour.
     
            Images of the climbers hanging off the cliffside as they waited for others to progress along the via ferrata – metal rungs secured to the mountain – went viral on Chinese social media.
     
            “This is frightening! Someone like me afraid of heights might just wet myself up there!” wrote one Chinese online commenter.
     
            “I won’t even go even if I’m offered cash to do this,” another said.
     
            Another commenter asked what would happen if one of the climbers fell and needed rescuing, but all were shown wearing helmets, harnesses, and safety gear.

            Wenzhou Dingcheng Sports Development Co., Ltd, which manages the via ferrata, said it had underestimated the number of people interested in climbing the mountain.
     
            “Due to our misjudgment of how many customers would come, the lack of effective traffic controls such as a ticket reservation system, and shortcomings in onsite management, customers were blocked and trapped on the climbing route,” the company said in a statement.
     
            The company added that it was temporarily halting ticket sales while it handled the situation internally, and would be rolling out a traffic-control system for visitors in the future.
     
            Yandang Mountain is about 410 kilometers (255 miles) south of Shanghai, in Zhejiang province, and is 1,150 meters (3,773 feet) high.
     
            The first week of May is the Labor Day holiday in China, which contributed to the large numbers of tourists in the area.
     
            A popular site for holidaymakers in China, Yandang Mountain was submitted for UNESCO World Heritage site designation in 2001 and remains on the tentative list.

            Xi Jinping pushed back against allegations of his country’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine during meetings with European leaders, as the Chinese leader makes a six-day visit to the continent amid a period of rising China-Europe tensions spurred by concerns of Beijing’s close to ties Moscow.
     
            “China is neither the creator of the crisis, nor a party to it or a participant. But we are also not a bystander, we have always been actively contributing to reaching peace,” Xi said during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris Monday, following a day of meetings that also included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
     
            “We also oppose using the Ukraine crisis to shed responsibility or defame a third country and provoke a new Cold War,” Xi added, in an apparent reference to allegations from Washington about the role of Chinese “dual use” exports like machine tools and microelectronics in supporting Russia’s defense indust﻿ry.
     
European trade frictions with China and suspicions over its global ambitions ramped up in the wake of the war, after Beijing refused to condemn the invasion and instead emerged as a key lifeline for the heavily sanctioned Russian economy.
     
            Xi’s visit to Europe – his first in five years – is viewed by Beijing as an opportunity for the leader to present China’s own narrative on its role in the conflict playing out in Europe directly to leaders there – while seeking to open up space between the views of Washington and its European allies.
     
            The trip will also see Xi visit Serbia and Hungary, with the leader’s visit to Belgrade coinciding with the 25th anniversary of NATO’s bombing of the Chinese embassy in the city that killed three.
     
            “The Chinese people cherish peace, but will never allow a repeat of historical tragedy. The friendship of people of both countries forged by blood has become a shared memory and will encourage both sides to make strides forward,” Xi wrote in an article for Serbian media released ahead of the visit.
     
            The attack, which the US said was an accident, was part of a wider bombing campaign by NATO in the Balkans during the spring of 1999 and drove Beijing’s deep enmity for the alliance – a view that’s since driven it closer to Russia.
     
            Xi’s visit to the continent comes as American officials in recent weeks have raised concerns with Chinese counterparts about dual use goods exported from China to Russia, which they say are enabling Russia to expand its defense industrial base as it continues its onslaught against Ukraine.
     
            The support China is providing includes significant quantities of machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and technology for cruise missiles, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, which Russia uses to make propellant for weapons, senior Biden administration officials said last month.
     
            Beijing has defended its trade with Russia as part of normal bilateral ties; it also says it does not provide weapons to parties in conflict. It has not been accused of sending lethal weapons to Russia, but rather goods with military use.

            Macron said that during their meetings Xi “reiterated” a commitment that he’s made a year ago on “not sending weapons and aid to Moscow as well as (to) strictly control China’s export of goods that could be used in a military way.”
     
            “The length and quality of our exchanges on this subject is a source of reassurance [for me],” Macron said during their joint presser.
     
            He also thanked Xi for agreeing to visit France before an expected visit from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Beijing in the coming weeks, so that Europe can clearly express to China its thoughts on Russia’s war in Ukraine and willingness to support Kyiv for “as long as it takes.”
     
            Xi and Macron together called for a global Olympic truce, which would see a pause in fighting in all conflicts during the upcoming Summer Games in Paris.
     
            The Chinese leader also called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war on Monday, with Xi and Macron releasing a joint statement saying it was “imperative to achieve an immediate and sustainable ceasefire,” while ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid, protection of civilians and “immediate and unconditional” release of hostages.
     
            Xi’s visit to Europe comes as the threat of escalation in the war continues to loom, with Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering Russian forces to rehearse deploying tactical nuclear weapons, as part of military drills to respond to what he called “threats” by the West.
     
            In comments following her meeting with Xi and Macron, von der Leyen said Xi “played an important role in de-escalating Russia’s irresponsible nuclear threats” and that she was “confident” he would “continue to do so against the backdrop of the ongoing nuclear threats by Russia.”
     
            “We count on China to use all its influence on Russia to end Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,” she said, adding that “more effort” was needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia “that find their way to the battlefield.”

            While claiming neutrality in the conflict and seeking to position itself as a peacemaker, Beijing has so far given little appearance of using its leverage with Russia to push the country toward a resolution that would be favored by Europe.
     
            Xi is also widely seen by analysts as being careful to ensure that any outcome of the war doesn’t weaken Putin, who he sees as a key partner in pushing back against US “containment.”
     
            In comments Monday, Xi reiterated China’s call for “all parties” involved in the conflict to restart dialogue and “gradually accumulate mutual trust.”
     
            He also appearing to push back against peace conferences which have not included Russia, such as the one expected in Switzerland next month. Beijing supports efforts recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with “equal and just discussions of all possible peace plans at the conference,” he said.

            When Xi Jinping arrived in Italy for a state visit in 2019, he was given a lavish welcome, with private tours of Roman landmarks and a dinner serenaded by opera singer Andrea Bocelli, topped with a crowning flourish – Italy’s decision to join Xi’s signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
     
            Five years later, the Chinese leader has returned to Europe in a very different climate. Xi landed in France Sunday and, while the pomp and ceremony may remain during his six-day European tour, views on China across the continent have shifted dramatically since his last visit.
     
            In the past weeks alone, the European Union has launched trade probes into China’s wind turbines and procurement of medical equipment, and raided offices of Chinese security equipment maker Nuctech as part of an investigation into subsidies. Germany and the United Kingdom in recent days also arrested or charged at least six people for alleged espionage and related crimes linked to China.
     
            And in March, Italy formally exited the Belt and Road, costing the program its only G7 member country, in a blow to China and its leader.
     
            Behind these developments are mounting economic grievances that have the EU preparing for a potential major trade confrontation with China — as well as growing suspicions about Beijing’s global ambitions and influence, driven by alarm over China’s deepening ties with Russia as it wages war against Ukraine.
     
            “China is seen increasingly as a multi-faceted threat in many European capitals. But there are divisions within Europe over how fast and far to go in addressing concerns about China, both in the economic and security spheres,” said Noah Barkin, a Berlin-based visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
     
            Now, Xi’s trip — with stops in France, Serbia and Hungary — is an opportunity to woo his critics, but also showcase that even as views are hardening in some parts of Europe, others still welcome China with open arms.
     
            Beijing is keen to dampen Europe’s push to address alleged trade distortions, which would come at a bad time for China’s flagging economy. It also wants to ensure Europe doesn’t draw any closer to the United States, especially amid uncertainty over the outcome of the upcoming US election.
     
            Major breakthroughs with China’s toughest critics will be hard to come by unless Xi is ready to make surprise concessions. And the trip could instead serve to underscore divisions — not only between Europe and China but those within Europe that could play to China’s favor, analysts say.
     
            Xi’s visit started with one of his toughest critics.
     
            The Chinese leader met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen alongside French President Emmanuel Macron Monday.
     
            Von der Leyen has spearheaded the EU’s rallying cry to “derisk” its supply chains from China over concerns about securing key technologies, and is driving a high-stakes anti-subsidy investigation, backed by France, into the influx of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports to Europe.
     
            China earlier this year opened an investigation into the price of brandy imported from the EU in a move that could hit France’s cognac sector and is widely seen as retaliation for the probe.
     
            During a joint press conference in Paris Monday, Macron said Europe was not looking to stir up trouble with its trade policy, but simply trying to stay sovereign. He also thanked Xi for keeping an open mind on the issue of French cognac. The two countries would continue their trade discussions, Macron said.
     
            “China’s direct investment in France is three times lower than that of France in China. We need to rebalance this,” Macron added. “In sectors like electric vehicles, batteries as well as most cutting-edge technologies, digital platforms etc, I would like to see us (the Franco-Chinese cooperation) go a lot further.”
     
            As for Xi, he called for closer relations between the two nations in fields including agriculture, finance, aerospace, nuclear power, and cultural exchanges.
 
            According to Xi, China and France signed a total of 18 interdepartmental cooperation agreements during the visit.

            Ahead of the visit, Macron signaled his desire to push Xi on economic ties, and reiterated concerns made by Europe and the United States that China is flooding global markets with cheap goods it can’t sell at home.
     
            “I’m calling for an ‘aggiornamento’ because China is now in excess capacity in many areas and exports massively to Europe,” the French president said in an interview Sunday with French outlet La Tribune Dimanche, using the Italian word for ‘update.’
     
            Xi, however, may win more goodwill during his one-on-one time with Macron, which is expected to include what Elysee sources described as more “personal” time in the Pyrenees mountains of southern France.
     
            “France has built this reputation of being a fairly independent actor in the EU and willing to create some space with the US,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.
     
            “Xi may want to work on Macron to see if he can get more European distance from North America,” as well as tightening his rapport with this important EU player, Chong said.
     
            In a statement released by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his arrival, Xi said the two countries had throughout their relations set “a model for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different social systems.”
     
            The war in Ukraine — a crucial sore point in Europe-China relations — is also on the agenda this week.
     
            Beijing has appeared to do little to move the Kremlin toward European visions for peace in Ukraine, despite repeated efforts to push Xi to use his rapport with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin has said he plans to visit China this month, according to Russian state media.
     
            In their joint press conference, Xi reiterated China’s stance on Ukraine, stating that Beijing has been playing an active role in promoting peace. He added that China is against any parties using the Ukraine crisis to incite a “new Cold War.”
     
            Macron said: “The length and quality of our exchanges on this subject is a source of reassurance (for me).”
     
            Xi’s visit comes as the United States and its European allies grow increasingly vocal about concerns that China’s exports of dual-use goods to Russia are powering its war machine. Beijing defends that trade as a regular part of its bilateral relations.
     
            “At some point soon” Europe could decide to move more aggressively in sanctioning Chinese firms selling such goods, according to Barkin at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
     
            Xi’s stops in Serbia and Hungary are likely to be much less contentious — something the Chinese government likely factored in when mapping out the visit, observers say.
     
            “In Belgrade and Budapest, Xi will not have to listen to the criticism he hears in other European capitals,” said Barkin. “Their leaders welcome Chinese investment, and they don’t have a problem with China’s deepening ties to Russia.”
     
            Xi’s visit to Belgrade will coincide with the week of the 25th anniversary of NATO’s bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade that killed three. The attack, part of a wider bombing campaign by NATO in the Balkans during the spring of 1999, drove Beijing’s deep enmity for the alliance, even as the United States said it was an accident.
     
            Any commemoration of the event by Xi could underscore the deep divisions between China and NATO, which Beijing sees as an embodiment of American overreach and a source of Europe’s security challenges – a view that has driven it closer to Russia.
     
            Xi may also look to highlight Chinese investments in both Belgrade and Budapest in a message to the rest of Europe.

            Non-EU member Serbia, which Beijing earlier this week described as an “iron-clad” friend, has seen growing trade and investment ties with China under President Aleksandar Vučić.
     
            In January, the Balkan nation announced a deal that could see more than $2 billion of Chinese investment in wind and solar power plants and a hydrogen production facility, Reuters reported at the time.
     
            In Hungary, Xi will look to deepen his relationship with increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban – a useful ally for China in the EU, where he has blocked or criticized EU efforts to hold China to account on human rights issues.
     
            The central European country has also emerged as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including EV makers – a situation that analysts say could help Chinese firms maneuver around existing and potential EU tariffs.
     
            That means Xi is likely to exit his European trip on a very different note from the one he begins with.
     
            “There, at least, the optics will be that there’s a lot of acceptance of Xi,” said Chong at the National University of Singapore.

            China has reported a surge in tourism during the just concluded  Labor Day holiday, but travelers cut back on their spending, in a sign that consumption in world’s second largest economy remains sluggish.
     
            Tourists made a total of 295 million trips within mainland China during the five-day-long holiday, which ended on Sunday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism said on Monday.
     
            That was 28% more than the number of trips taken during the Labor Day holiday period in 2019, which lasted only four days. Months later, in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic would strike China and the world, largely shutting down travel.
     
            This year’s Labor Day tourism revenue was 166.89 billion yuan ($23.6 billion), only 13.5% higher than the 2019 level.
     
            That means tourists were spending less money per trip compared to five years ago, as their average spending dropped 6% to 565.73 yuan ($80).
     
            There was a similar pattern at China’s box office.
     
            During the holiday period, 37.77 million people went to the cinema, exceeding 2019’s 35.09 million.
     
            But ticket sales were about the same as 2019 levels, reaching 1.527 billion yuan ($215.7 million).
     
            Chinese consumers have curtailed spending as the economy weakens and job prospects worsen. A record downturn in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, is weighing on consumer sentiment.
     
            “[Chinese] consumer sentiment appears shaky judging by the sluggish retail sales spending momentum and the sharp reversal in the April services PMI,” analysts from TD Securities said in a recent research note.
     
            On Monday, a private sector survey showed that the Caixin/S&P Global services PMI fell to 52.5 in April from 52.7 in the previous month.
     
            The services sub-index under the government’s official non-manufacturing PMI also dropped sharply to 50.3 in April from 52.4 in March, according to statistics released by the National Bureau of Statistics last week. It was the weakest reading since January.
     
            In March, retail sales growth slowed to 3.1% from 5.5% in February. Consumer inflation increased by a muted 0.1% in March from a year earlier, down from 0.7% in February, which was the first increase in six months.

            Hainan, a Chinese island that’s geographically closer to Hanoi than Beijing, is known as the Hawaii of China due to its sandy beaches and temperate weather.
     
            But there’s another reason tourists from around China are flocking to Hainan these days: space.
     
            The city of Wenchang is home to a rocket launch center – and a tourist industry that caters to a growing interest in space-related tourism.
     
            China has made no secret of its desire to develop tourism here, drawing inspiration from Florida’s Cape Canaveral – the launchpad for many famous NASA space missions.
     
            CNN visited Wenchang, on Hainan’s northeast coast, to experience the thrill firsthand ahead of the May 3 launch of the Chang’e-6 probe, which aims to explore the far side of the moon in its 53-day mission.
     
            The interior of the Hilton Wenchang looks more like a space center than a typical tropical resort. From celestial scenes in the corridors to a rocket on the breakfast buffet, the sprawling property is inspired by the nearby Wenchang Launch Center.
     
            At the hotel gift shop, visitors can find space-inspired kids’ toys, stuffed animals and models. Ahead of the May moon mission, the hotel offered a special aerospace-inspired afternoon tea. For around $30, guests were served a platter with planet-style bite-sized cakes, chocolate planes and astronauts, and a mousse-filled rocket, garnished with blue and pink sugar crystals representing the heavens above.

Hainan: Is this where Hawaii meets Dubai?
 
            The space theme continues around Wenchang.
     
            Rocket designs hang from light poles and there are several displays of Chinese spacecraft – perfect for a selfie or family portrait. Bottled water sold in stores comes in containers shaped like rockets.
     
            The growth of China’s space program has fueled more interest in all things aeronautic. Hotel representatives tell CNN that room rates at the Hilton Wenchang can be seven times higher when there’s a launch. Visitors can watch the takeoff from the hotel’s beach.
     
            State media in China reports that 1.5 million people have visited Wenchang in the past two years, while the number of hotels has gone from five to more than 50.
     
            Unsurprisingly, the space program has instilled a sense of national pride in China.
     
            That’s certainly the case for photographer Yan Zehua, who has a stand in Wenchang where he sells his work on postcards.
     
            “Although it’s my 24th time, maybe, to see the rocket launch, I’m still excited about this,” he told CNN.
     
            Parents also brought their children for the big moment. Several told CNN that they hoped getting to see a launch up close would give the kids an interest in science and technology.
     
            “This is our first time digging lunar soil from (the far side of) the moon,” one mom said. “So we are happy to watch (how it is done). And I brought my daughter to watch this together.”
     
            Space-inspired attractions are just one way that China is diversifying its tourism offerings on Hainan beyond the beach.
     
            A Hello Kitty-themed resort and park is under construction with a tentative opening date in 2025.
     
            In addition, it’s easier for tourists from around the world to visit Hainan than other regions of China. The island is visa-free for residents of more than 50 countries, including the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Malaysia and Japan.

            China launched an uncrewed lunar mission Friday that aims to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time, in a potentially major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe – China’s most complex robotic lunar mission to date – blasted off on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China’s Hainan island, where space fans had gathered to watch the historic moment. The country’s National Space Administration said the launch was a success.
     
            The launch marks the start of a mission that aims to be a key milestone in China’s push to become a dominant space power with plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research base on its south pole.
     
            It comes as a growing number of countries, including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field.
     
            China’s planned 53-day mission would see the Chang’e-6 lander touch down in a gaping crater on the moon’s far side, which never faces Earth. China became the first and only country to land on the moon’s far side during its 2019 Chang’e-4 mission.
     
            Any far-side samples retrieved by the Chang’e-6 lander could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon and the solar system itself – and provide important data to advance China’s lunar ambitions.
     
            “The Chang’e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology of the moon’s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent technologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,” Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administration’s (CNSA) Center of Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering said last week from the launch site.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe will be a key test for China’s space capabilities in its effort to realize leader Xi Jinping’s “eternal dream” of building the country into a space power.
     
            China has made rapid space advancements in recent years, in a field traditionally led by the United States and Russia.
     
            With the Chang’e program, launched in 2007 and named for the moon goddess of Chinese mythology, China in 2013 became the first country to achieve a robotic lunar landing in nearly four decades. In 2022, China completed its own orbital space station, the Tiangong.
 
            The technically complex Chang’e-6 mission builds on both the Chang’e-4’s 2019 record of landing on the far side of the moon, and Chang’e-5’s 2020 success returning to Earth with near-side moon samples.
     
            This time, to communicate with Earth from the moon’s far side, Chang’e-6 must rely on the Queqiao-2 satellite, launched into lunar orbit in March.
     
            The probe itself is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module.
     
            The mission plan is for the Chang’e-6’s lander to gather moon dust and rocks after touching down in the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer diameter South Pole-Aitken basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago.
     
            An ascender spacecraft would then transport the samples to the lunar orbiter for transfer to the reentry module and the mission’s return to Earth.
     
            The complex mission “goes through virtually every step” that will be required for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon in the years ahead, according to James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has collaborated with Chinese scientists leading the mission.
     
            In addition to returning samples that could yield “fundamental new insights into the origin and early history of the moon and solar system,” the mission also serves as “robotic practice for these steps” to get astronauts to the moon and back, he said.
     
            China plans to launch two more missions in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon before building a research station in the following decade on the lunar south pole – a region believed to contain water ice.
     
            Chang’e-7, scheduled for 2026, will aim to search for resources on the moon’s south pole, while Chang’e-8 roughly two years later could look at how to utilize lunar materials to prepare for building the research base, Chinese officials have said.
     
            Friday’s launch comes as multiple nations ramp up their lunar programs amid a growing focus on the potential access to resources and further deep space exploration access that successful moon missions could bring.
     
            Last year, India landed its first spacecraft on the moon, while Russia’s first lunar mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon’s surface.
     
            In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole.
     
            That landing – the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades – is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there as soon as 2026 and build its scientific base camp.
     
            NASA administrator Bill Nelson last month appeared to acknowledge that China’s pace – and concerns about its intentions – were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions.
     
            “We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program. I think in effect we are in a race,” Nelson told lawmakers last month, adding his concern that China could try to bar the US or other countries from certain lunar areas if they arrive there first.

            China launched an uncrewed lunar mission Friday that aims to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time, in a potentially major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe – China’s most complex robotic lunar mission to date – blasted off on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China’s Hainan island, where space fans had gathered to watch the historic moment. The country’s National Space Administration said the launch was a success.
     
            The launch marks the start of a mission that aims to be a key milestone in China’s push to become a dominant space power with plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research base on its south pole.
     
            It comes as a growing number of countries, including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field.
     
            China’s planned 53-day mission would see the Chang’e-6 lander touch down in a gaping crater on the moon’s far side, which never faces Earth. China became the first and only country to land on the moon’s far side during its 2019 Chang’e-4 mission.
     
            Any far-side samples retrieved by the Chang’e-6 lander could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon and the solar system itself – and provide important data to advance China’s lunar ambitions.
     
            “The Chang’e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology of the moon’s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent technologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,” Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administration’s (CNSA) Center of Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering said last week from the launch site.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe will be a key test for China’s space capabilities in its effort to realize leader Xi Jinping’s “eternal dream” of building the country into a space power.
     
            China has made rapid space advancements in recent years, in a field traditionally led by the United States and Russia.
     
            With the Chang’e program, launched in 2007 and named for the moon goddess of Chinese mythology, China in 2013 became the first country to achieve a robotic lunar landing in nearly four decades. In 2022, China completed its own orbital space station, the Tiangong.
 
            The technically complex Chang’e-6 mission builds on both the Chang’e-4’s 2019 record of landing on the far side of the moon, and Chang’e-5’s 2020 success returning to Earth with near-side moon samples.
     
            This time, to communicate with Earth from the moon’s far side, Chang’e-6 must rely on the Queqiao-2 satellite, launched into lunar orbit in March.
     
            The probe itself is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module.
     
            The mission plan is for the Chang’e-6’s lander to gather moon dust and rocks after touching down in the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer diameter South Pole-Aitken basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago.
     
            An ascender spacecraft would then transport the samples to the lunar orbiter for transfer to the reentry module and the mission’s return to Earth.
     
            The complex mission “goes through virtually every step” that will be required for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon in the years ahead, according to James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has collaborated with Chinese scientists leading the mission.

            A highway collapsed in southern China early on Wednesday after days of torrential rain, sending cars plummeting down a hill and killing dozens of people, Chinese state media reported.
     
            At least 48 people were killed following the collapse of a section of the expressway linking Meizhou city with Dabu county in Guangdong province, according to Ma Zhengyong, Communist Party secretary of Meizhou city.
     
            Some 23 vehicles had been recovered as rescue work continued Thursday, while 30 injured people remain in hospital in stable condition, CCTV said.
     
            The Guangdong provincial government had sent a rescue team of about 500 people, the state broadcaster said.
     
            More than 184 square meters of the highway disintegrated, officials told state news agency Xinhua.

            The incident sparked calls to strengthen inspection and reinforcement work of infrastructure to cope with increasingly extreme weather conditions, state media have reported.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned of the “widespread rainfall and strong atmospheric convection” – a cause of unstable weather – saying it could subject the country to more frequent accidents and natural disasters, Xinhua reported, citing an instruction he gave.
     
            Xi ordered authorities to improve alert systems, strengthen emergency planing and identify potential risks.
     
            Extreme weather around the world is becoming more intense and more frequent against the backdrop of a very fast-warming climate.

            The United States imposed sanctions on more than a dozen companies in China and Hong Kong for their support of Russia’s war in Ukraine as part of a tranche of nearly 300 new sanctions unveiled Wednesday.
     
            The move comes after repeated warnings from top US officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to top Chinese officials that they must crack down on China’s provision of dual-use items to Russia that the US says are being used to strengthen its military in the war against Ukraine.
     
            “The almost 300 targets being sanctioned by both Treasury and the Department of State include sanctions on dozens of actors that have enabled Russia to acquire desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad,” the Treasury Department said in a news release.
     
            The sanctions also hit targets within Russia, as well as Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
     
            The sanctions are aimed at cracking down on sanctions evasion and support for Russia’s military-industrial base and its biological and chemical weapons programs. The Treasury Department also targeted those involved in providing precursor materials to Russia used in explosives.
     
            According to a State Department fact sheet, its sanctions hit Chinese “entities responsible for developing, and supplying dual-use aerospace, manufacturing, and technology equipment to entities based in Russia.”
     
            “Specifically, these designations target producers and exporters of items critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base, some of whom have shipped goods to U.S.- designated entities in Russia,” the fact sheet said.
     
            The Biden administration has increasingly sounded the alarm about China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base – support that the US says has allowed Moscow to continue its war against Ukraine.
     
            Moreover, as Russia has begun to build back its defense capabilities, the US has sought to rally allies to pressure Beijing – via diplomatic means or, if that fails, punitive measures – to stop providing the support, and they are looking to see if that pressure has or will have an impact.
     
            “Russia is no longer kind of on its back foot,” a senior State Department official said before Blinken’s trip to China. “They are surging. They have substantial assets, they reconstituted. They that pose a threat not just to Ukraine but to the wider region.”
     
            The top US diplomat said following a day of meetings in Beijing that “when it comes to China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base, all I can tell you is I was extremely clear about our concerns in some detail, but we’ll have to see what actions follow from that. “
     
            “It is absolutely critical that the support that it’s providing – not in terms of weapons but components for the defense industrial base – again, things like machine tools, microelectronics, where it is overwhelmingly the number-one supplier to Russia. That’s having a material effect in Ukraine and against Ukraine, but it’s also having a material effect in creating a growing that Russia poses to countries in Europe and something that has captured their attention in a very intense way,” he said last week.
     
            Despite those conversations, there is little sign that Beijing intends to heed the US warnings.

            China’s newest, largest and most-advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, took a big step to joining the world’s largest naval fleet on Wednesday as it set out from Shanghai for its first sea trials.
     
            The naval assessment is expected to take place in the East China Sea, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the Jiangnan Shipyard where the carrier has been under construction for more than six years, according to Shanghai’s Maritime Safety Administration.
     
            “The sea trials will primarily test the reliability and stability of the aircraft carrier’s propulsion and electrical systems,” read an announcement from the state-run Xinhua news agency on Wednesday.
     
            The warship was launched in 2022 and has “completed its mooring trials, outfitting work and equipment adjustments” working up to the latest sea trials, Xinhua said.
     
            With a displacement of 80,000 metric tons, the Fujian dwarfs the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) two active carriers, the 66,000-ton Shandong and the 60,000-ton Liaoning. Only the United States Navy operates bigger aircraft carriers than Fujian.
     
            “The Fujian’s sea trials represent an important milestone for the PLAN, marking its entry into the small club of top-class carrier aviation-capable navies,” said John Bradford, a Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs fellow.
     
            The Fujian’s key feature is an electromagnetic catapult system that will enable it to launch larger and heavier aircraft than the Shandong and Liaoning, which use a ski-jump style launch method.
     
            Analysts say the Fujian’s ability to launch larger warplanes carrying higher munitions loads to farther distances will give the carrier a greater combat range than its predecessors in the Chinese fleet, providing the PLAN with so-called “blue-water” capabilities.
     
            “These sea trials mark the first major step in China’s developing the capacity to project sea-based air power into deep ocean areas,” said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
     
            The electromagnetic catapult system puts the Fujian on par with the US Navy’s newest carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, the only active carrier in the world with an electromagnetic catapult system. The US Navy’s 10 older carriers, the Nimitz class, rely on steam-powered catapults to launch aircraft.

Expert’s warning to US Navy on China: Bigger fleet almost always wins
 
            All the US carriers, however, will retain two key advantages over the Fujian: power and size.
     
            The US carriers are nuclear powered, giving them the ability to remain at sea for as long as crew provisions last, while the Fujian is powered by conventional fuel, meaning it must either make a port call or be met by a tanker at sea to refuel.
     
            As for the US Navy’s size advantage over the Fujian, the Ford displaces 100,000 tons and the 10 Nimitz-class ships 87,000 metric tons. The larger US ships can take on more aircraft, around 75 compared to an expected complement of 60 on the Fujian, according to estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
     
            Analysts have also noted that the US carriers have more catapults, a larger airway and more elevators to allow for quicker deployment of aircraft from the hangar deck below.
     
            The US carriers “remain in an echelon of their own,” Bradford said.
     
            Schuster said the current round of sea trials for Fujian are expected to last three to six days and would not include flight operations.
     
            “Radars and communications equipment will get some testing, but the first sea trials always focus on hull integrity, propulsion and engineering since problems there prevent everything else from working well,” Schuster said.
     
            In total, analysts expect the Fujian’s sea trials to take at least a year, with its commissioning likely to come next year or in 2026. A story on the website of the Chinese Defense Ministry in January noted the Liaoning underwent 10 sea trials and the Shandong nine before entering service.

            When it joins the PLAN fleet, the Fujian will become the icon of what is now the world’s largest naval force,with more than 340 warships and counting as Chinese shipyards turn out new warships at a frenetic pace.
     
            “It will be the most visible symbol of China’s growing naval power,” said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the CSIS.
     
            Meanwhile, the announcement of a fourth carrier for the Chinese fleet could come soon, PLAN political commissar Yuan Huazhi said in March, according to a report in the state-run Global Times.

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            In the early days of 2020, as science looked for answers to a mysterious viral outbreak in central China, a prominent Chinese virologist stepped forward to share critical data with the world.
     
            Zhang Yongzhen’s disclosure of the genome of the virus that causes Covid-19 was a crucial step in the race to combat the pandemic, helping researchers globally to identify the pathogen and create vaccines to counter it.
     
            He was lauded for his integrity by the scientific community, but in the years since, people who know Zhang say he has faced a series of unprecedented roadblocks in his career in China – with yet another barrier placed in front of his research over the past week.
     
            On Sunday and Monday, Zhang, 59, slept overnight in protest outside his lab at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center after administrators closed the facility abruptly for renovations, according to accounts posted on his Weibo social media page.
     
            A post on his page early Wednesday said a “tentative agreement” had been reached for Zhang’s team to resume their scientific work at the lab, some of which is related to tracing the origins of Covid-19.
     
            The ordeal is just the latest hindrance to Zhang’s research since 2020, according to a colleague who has been in contact with the Chinese scientist in recent years.
     
            An account by Zhang’s research students posted online also laid out a litany of challenges faced by the scientist since the formal transfer of his official employment to the Shanghai center in 2020, when his 19-year tenure at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also ended.
     
            Their account, reposted on Zhang’s Weibo page and seen by CNN, has since been deleted. It alleges the Shanghai center, which is affiliated with the city’s Fudan University, failed to formally recognize Zhang’s employment, leaving him without social security and medical benefits, and that it prematurely terminated a five-year cooperation agreement with the scientist.
     
            “That a top scientist in his field, a person who has made contributions to the country and mankind should have fallen to this point – is really sad and chilling,” the post read.

            In a statement Monday, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center said it had closed some labs for renovation due to safety concerns and claimed it had provided additional office and experimental spaces for Zhang and his team.
     
            The “institute always respects … and supports scientific researchers and students in carrying out normal research work,” the statement said.
     
            Images posted on social media this week appeared to show Zhang wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the doorstep of the lab building as security guards hovered over him.
     
            Reached briefly by phone on Monday, Zhang told CNN the center’s explanation that the lab needed renovation and there was ample notification of the move was “nonsense.”
     
            More than a dozen students’ research had been impacted by the lab closure, he said, adding it was “inconvenient” to say more at that time.
     
            In his post Wednesday, Zhang said his team would “discuss with the (center) the future relocation plan of the laboratory, the guarantee of normal life and scientific research work for students during the transition period,” and work to resolve issues related to his own agreements with the center. CNN was unable to independently confirm his post.
     
            The earlier post by Zhang’s students said the two days originally allocated by the center for them to move their scientific work was insufficient. Their lab had been renovated as recently as 2020 and a second lab hadn’t been in use since the pandemic, they added.
     
            Neither Zhang nor the online post detailing the circumstances leading to his protest connected the lab closure to his sharing of the coronavirus genome sequence in 2020.
     
            Multiple calls from CNN to the public relations department of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center went unanswered on Tuesday.
     
            Zhang became the first scientist to share Covid-19’s genomic sequence on January 11, 2020 as the World Health Organization waited for China to provide the data following its announcement nearly two weeks earlier of a viral outbreak in the central city of Wuhan.
     
            He was hailed internationally for his work and named by Nature as one of 10 people who helped shape science in 2020.
     
            In an interview with the journal that year, Zhang reflected on his global recognition.
     
            “They say, ‘January 11 was a turning point for understanding that this is serious. It was a turning point for China. It was a turning point for the world,’” he said.
     
            But in China, Zhang faced challenges to his work that stemmed from that moment, according to his long-time collaborator Edward Holmes, a University of Sydney professor who published the genome with Zhang’s permission on an international data sharing website.
     
            Following the release of the data, Zhang’s lab had limitations placed on it, which barred it from isolating the Covid virus, Holmes said.

            It’s unclear if this move was separate from a Chinese government “rectification” order received by Zhang’s team that reports at the time said resulted in the temporary closure of the lab a day after the sequence release. Zhang told Nature in 2020 that the order merely required his lab to update its biosafety protocols after moving equipment during construction work.
     
            Zhang, a scientist with China’s CDC since 2001, was also forced out of the agency in September 2020, according to a person familiar with the situation.
     
            CNN approached China’s National Health Commission, which oversees the CDC, for comment.
     
            These changes for Zhang came as China – already known for top-down control on the academic sector – tightened oversight of scientific information related to the virus. That included imposing restrictions by April 2020 on the publication of academic research on the origins of the novel coronavirus.
     
            Beijing has repeatedly defended its scientific transparency and data sharing related to the outbreak.
     
            “The idea that (Zhang) would do anything anti-China is ridiculous given his (national) pride. But clearly the government wanted a certain message to be conveyed, a certain narrative to be put out on the outbreak in Wuhan … by releasing the sequence of the virus he broke that instruction – and it all stems from that,” Holmes told CNN on Monday.
     
            “In the old days, pre-Covid … he was like a machine and now the machine is broken. He’s just been slowly crushed by this.”
     
            In the months after he shared the Covid-19 sequence, Zhang’s employment was transferred to the Shanghai Public Health Center, where he had held a five-year cooperation agreement and part-time professorship since 2018. It’s unclear if this move was already in the works prior to January 2020.
     
            Since then, he has continued to publish in journals such as Cell and Nature Microbiology on the presence of viruses in animals and nature in China and received at least two international awards.
     
            The most recent of his international publications in March looked at coronavirus variants in Shanghai in the initial months of the Covid-19 outbreak, and Zhang’s team continues to work on research related to the virus and its emergence.
     
            Ongoing research includes a National Natural Science Foundation of China project at the laboratory, the post said.

            In a Weibo post on January 11 marking the fourth anniversary of his Covid disclosure, Zhang appeared to allude to the challenges he has faced in the years since.
     
            “Four years ago this morning, on behalf of the research team, we insisted on putting life first and made the right choice,” Zhang wrote.
     
            “Despite going through continuous ups and downs, experiencing the warmth and cold of human emotion, and the harshness of the world, we have no regrets.”
     
            But recent years have taken a steep toll on Zhang, according to Holmes.
     
            “He’s not the same in terms of his productivity, he’s completely different – not the same person at all. It’s just been extraordinary to watch and extraordinary that it’s come to this,” he said.
     
            Holmes, who had limited email contact with Zhang during his protest this week, said the Chinese virologist had told him he recently failed in his pursuit of a legal case against the Shanghai center for its handling of his contract.
     
            “(All this has) gone on for a long time … but I hadn’t realized how bad it had got,” Holmes said.

            Like hundreds of millions of workers in China, Hao Zeyu, an algorithm engineer at an electric vehicle maker, is getting five days off this week for the Labor Day holiday. But he’s in no mood to party.
     
            In order to take the vacation, Hao is required to work an extra day on each weekend immediately before and after the break.
     
            To add insult to injury, two of the official vacation days fall on Saturday and Sunday. That means just one of those five days counts as a genuine holiday.
     
            The practice of moving workdays to weekends to create a longer vacation during major Chinese holidays is known as “tiaoxiu” or adjusted rest. Introduced in 1999 to stimulate consumer spending following the Asian financial crisis, it has been the subject of much online anger in the weeks leading up to this year’s May 1 holiday.
     
            “I really don’t like it,” Hao told CNN. “I think this policy was meant to promote consumption at a certain stage of the country’s development, but I very much do not support it anymore,” he added.
     
            So, why has a decades-old policy caused so much upset in a country whose Communist Party leadership pays annual homage to International Workers’ Day?
     
            Workers say a post-Covid slump in the world’s second largest economy means they are increasingly afraid of losing their jobs if they dare to ask for extra leave on top of the officially sanctioned holidays — which they had previously felt comfortable doing.
     
            And they say they’re being asked to work harder than ever because their employers are trying to do more with fewer resources as economic misery — a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — piles up.
     
            In recent weeks, complaints about this year’s Labor Day leave arrangements have exploded on Chinese social media. Many have slammed the government for prioritizing business over something they desperately need, which is an actual break.
     
            People have been venting their frustration under the hashtags “you should not pretend not to hear voices opposing the tiaoxiu policy” and “tiaoxiu policy for May Day,” which have collectively drawn more than 560 million views combined.
     
            One user wrote the online discussion was not merely a policy debate, it’s an embodiment of “physical and mental exhaustion caused by crazy overtime work.”
     
            “What we are longing for is an effective rest that is urgently needed from overworking,” the person added.
     
            Another person wrote on social media platform Weibo that they “want more holidays not shifting things around in order to get those long holidays.”
     
            “Who will have the mood to spend money if they don’t have (real) holidays?” the person wrote.
     
            To make things worse, the “orchestrated” vacations often result in a scramble for hard-to-get train tickets, inflated hotel deals and chaos at popular tourist spots, Hao told CNN.
     
            Labor Day isn’t the only holiday to get the adjusted rest policy.
     
            The authorities also shuffle workdays around the Spring Festival, celebrated in January or February, and National Day, which takes place on October 1, to create seven-day breaks known as “Golden Weeks.”
     
            Christian Yao, a senior lecturer at the University of Wellington, said China’s economy is “in the middle of very bumpy years” as it strives to transform itself from a manufacturing powerhouse into a knowledge-based economy.

            He said workers are beginning to question where the country is heading. The slowing economy has, in turn, put pressure on companies to improve their productivity while cutting costs.
     
            “Workers are forced to work harder, afraid of losing jobs and at the same time afraid of whether finding another job is going to offer them better pay,” he said.
     
            Even though some workers are used to working long hours under China’s “996” work culture — the practice of working from 9 am to 9 pm six days a week that is common among the country’s tech companies, startups and other private businesses — others are now refusing to put up with the adjusted work policy, Yao said.
     
            With the policy, China is able to designate more than 25 days as official holidays. Without the maneuvering though, workers get 11 days, which is still in line with many other countries. The United States, for instance, offers 11 federal holidays while the United Kingdom has eight days.
     
            But the problem for Chinese workers is that their statutory paid time off (PTO), or annual leave, is just five days a year, which is much less than many other countries.
     
            When times were good, Chinese companies were more generous in granting those PTO days. But it’s a different story during an economic slowdown.
     
            Max Teng, a business analyst in the internet industry, told CNN that he used to work for a foreign company. But the truth is it was no better, he said.
     
            “If you take a long leave, everyone will have some negative feedback for you. So many people do not dare to take leave even if it’s offered,” he said.
     
            A minority of companies are doing things their own way. Yaer Tuerdi, 26, works in the marketing division of Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is run by fast food giant Yum China (YUMC).
     
            Yum China doesn’t require workers to come in during the two designated “special working days.”
     
            “I like it,” said Tuerdi. “You can arrange your break freely … If you want to travel, you can take annual leave to make up for the gap. If you don’t want to travel, you can still have two days of rest on the weekend.”
     
            A movement among independent businesses is pushing back on the obsession of excessively long work hours. Among the more prominent proponents is Pang Dong Lai, a supermarket chain known for its customer service based in the central province of Henan.
     
            In March, its founder and chairman Yu Donglai announced he was offering 10 days a year of “sadness leave” for employees who did not feel up to working, state media People’s Daily reported.
     
            “Everyone feels down inevitably every now and then and if they can have this sadness leave, they may feel good again,” it quoted him as saying. Managers, Yu added, cannot reject such leave applications.
     
            He has been one of the rare advocates of work-life balance in a culture that prizes “eating bitterness,” or enduring hardship to succeed, and often speaks at business forums to preach his beliefs.
     
            CNN has contacted the supermarket chain to ask about its Labor Day plans.
     
            As for Teng, he will have to work on May 11, a Saturday, as part of the standard holiday arrangement.
     
            “I feel very depressed because I have to work at least six days in a row,” he said.

            Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index surged more than 7% in April as the best-performing major index in the world. It’s now heading into a bull market, rebounding nearly 20% from its January low.
 
            The rebound marks a sharp turnaround after a weak start to 2024 and years of heavy losses, which saw more than $3 trillion wiped off the value of the city’s stock market as global investors grew increasingly skeptical about China’s economic future and worried about geopolitical tensions with the United States.
     
            But an improving economic landscape in China, cheaper valuations and a flurry of mainland investors putting money into Hong Kong to protect their portfolios from a weakening Chinese currency have combined to resuscitate the market.
     
            “Foreign inflows have started to come back with the bottoming of the [Chinese] economy,” said Kelly Chung, chief investment officer for multi assets at Value Partners, a Hong Kong-based asset management firm.
     
            The valuation of Hong Kong stocks has also become more “compelling” relative to the rest of the Asian region after the pullback last year, said Zhikai Chen, head of Asian equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management. He added that there is a shift in investors’ sentiments as Chinese economic data turned more positive.
     
            In recent days, investors have been getting increasingly upbeat because of reports that Beijing would roll out a “real solution” for the crisis-ridden property sector.
     
            “Attention is squarely on China’s property market, seen as the linchpin of the country’s economic stability,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.
     
            “Recent policy measures, ranging from lifting restrictions on homebuyers to providing support for developers’ funding needs, underscore the government’s commitment to bolstering this critical sector in 2024,” he said.
     
            There are signs that China’s economy might be bottoming out.
     
            Manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in 14 months in April, according to a private survey released on Tuesday.
     
            The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 51.4 in April from 51.1 in March, marking the sixth consecutive month of expansion, as new export orders recorded a solid increase because of improving global demand.
     CNN's Marc Stewart joins Julia Chatterley to discuss the latest GDP numbers from Beijing.

            In the first quarter, China’s gross domestic product grew 5.3% from a year ago, thanks to robust growth in high-tech manufacturing.
     
            “The PMIs, which are a leading economic indicator, suggest improving momentum since the start of the year,” said David Chao, global market strategist at Invesco.
     
            “Heading into the middle of the year, the recent PMIs are in much better territory when compared to a year ago, and I think this is due to fiscal and monetary stimulus working their way into the economy,” he said.
     
            Earlier this month, news outlet Caixin reported that Beijing is learning from Japan’s experience of decades of stagnation and is considering launching a national platform to acquire unfinished housing projects across the country. These projects would then be turned into affordable housing and the units would be sold or rented out.
     
            “[This] is largely consistent with what we have long believed would be the most effective way to rescue the property sector,” said Nomura analysts on Monday.
     
            “The Caixin report suggests Beijing is edging closer to a real solution for the property sector,” they added.
     
            Chinese equities listed in Hong Kong are also appearing to be more attractive, particularly in comparison to Indian markets, which have been booming on the back of robust economic growth.
     
            “We are observing investors starting to view India’s valuation as ‘expensive,’ and outflows have been seen from India to China [equities],” Angelina Lai, chief investment officer at St James’s Place, wrote in her quarterly market update earlier this month.
     
            “Although the macro picture in China is unpromising, the steep fall in Chinese equities has pushed the local equity risk premium above the trend,” she said.
     
            Innes said global investors are currently “underweight” in Chinese markets, including Hong Kong, because of geopolitical tensions and concerns surrounding potential fallout from the upcoming US elections.
     
            However, such market surges typically trigger “the fear of missing out (FOMO)”, especially given the attractive valuation of Chinese stocks compared to their US counterparts.
     
            “As a result, we may see a global rotation of funds into Chinese equities, indicating that the current rally could have further momentum to sustain its upward trajectory,” he added.
     
            Hong Kong has also seen strong inflows of money from mainland China, where investors are concerned about further depreciation of the Chinese currency and mainland assets, according to BNP Paribas’ analysts.
     
            The yuan has lost 4% of its value against the US dollar in the past year.

China’s consumer prices rise for first time in six months. But it’s too soon to say deflation is over
 
            While other major central banks have kept their monetary policies tight to control inflation, the People’s Bank of China has cut rates multiple times and pledged to maintain ample liquidity this year to fight deflation.
     
            Stock exchange data showed that southbound investors (meaning investment from mainland China into Hong Kong) have bought nearly $20 billion of Hong Kong-listed stocks in March and the first three weeks of April on a net basis.
     
            “We believe southbound investors could be using HK-listed equities to diversify their currency exposure in light of rising RMB depreciation pressure due to US-China interest rate differentials,” analysts from BNP Paribus said last week.
     
            “In our view, mainland Chinese investors often prefer to diversify their holdings to non-RMB denominated assets (eg HK-listed shares and commodities) during periods of RMB depreciation,” they said, adding that depreciation pressure on the yuan could continue for the rest of the year.

            China’s coast guard fired water cannons that damaged a Philippine vessel on Tuesday, marking the latest flare-up of violence between the two countries in the disputed South China Sea, Philippine authorities said.
     
            The Philippine Coast Guard said the incident occurred as one of its ships and a fisheries agency vessel carried out a “legitimate patrol” near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese-controlled rocky outcrop 130 miles (200 kilometers) west of the main Philippine island of Luzon and inside Manila’s exclusive economic zone.
     
            Video supplied by the Philippine Coast Guard showed two larger Chinese vessels firing water cannons from opposite sides of the Philippine ship.
     
            “The Philippine vessels encountered dangerous maneuvers and obstruction from four China Coast Guard vessels and six Chinese Maritime Militia vessels,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in the statement.
     
            The Philippine Coast Guard ship suffered “damage to the railing and canopy,” according to its statement. No injuries were reported.
     
            In a post on social platform Weibo Tuesday, the China Coast Guard said it had expelled the Philippine vessels for “intruding” into the waters, “in accordance with the law.”
     
Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.

            Scarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island and is also known as Bajo de Masinloc, is a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground.
     
            There are no structures on the shoal, but China has maintained a continuous coast guard presence around it since 2012, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
     
            The Philippines also said Tuesday that China had reinstalled a 380-meter (1,247-feet) floating barrier that “covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.”
     
            Scarborough Shoal is one of several disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which have long been a flashpoint of territorial disputes between the two nations.
     
            In March, Chinese coast guard ships fired water cannons against a Philippine vessel on a resupply mission to a contingent of Filipino marines on another contested South China Sea feature, Second Thomas Shoal, causing “heavy damages.”
     
            That shoal sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era transport ship called the BRP Sierra Madre on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is staffed by marines stationed on rotation.
     
            Following that incident, the China Coast Guard said on Weibo it had taken “control measures in accordance with the law” against the Philippine vessels, which it said had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef,” as Beijing calls Second Thomas Shoal.
     
            Earlier in March, Chinese water cannon hit a Philippine resupply boat as it headed to Second Thomas Shoal, shattering windows and injuring four Filipino sailors.
     
            Beijing and Manila’s South China Sea disputes have heated up since the 2022 election of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has taken a stronger line against China than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.
     
            The clashes have also raised fears they could lead to a wider conflict, as Manila maintains a mutual defense treaty with the United States, which Washington says covers Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway.

            China launched an uncrewed lunar mission Friday that aims to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time, in a potentially major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe – China’s most complex robotic lunar mission to date – blasted off on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China’s Hainan island, where space fans had gathered to watch the historic moment. The country’s National Space Administration said the launch was a success.
     
            The launch marks the start of a mission that aims to be a key milestone in China’s push to become a dominant space power with plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research base on its south pole.
     
            It comes as a growing number of countries, including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field.
     
            China’s planned 53-day mission would see the Chang’e-6 lander touch down in a gaping crater on the moon’s far side, which never faces Earth. China became the first and only country to land on the moon’s far side during its 2019 Chang’e-4 mission.
     
            Any far-side samples retrieved by the Chang’e-6 lander could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon and the solar system itself – and provide important data to advance China’s lunar ambitions.
     
            “The Chang’e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology of the moon’s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent technologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,” Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administration’s (CNSA) Center of Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering said last week from the launch site.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe will be a key test for China’s space capabilities in its effort to realize leader Xi Jinping’s “eternal dream” of building the country into a space power.
     
            China has made rapid space advancements in recent years, in a field traditionally led by the United States and Russia.
     
            With the Chang’e program, launched in 2007 and named for the moon goddess of Chinese mythology, China in 2013 became the first country to achieve a robotic lunar landing in nearly four decades. In 2022, China completed its own orbital space station, the Tiangong.
 
            The technically complex Chang’e-6 mission builds on both the Chang’e-4’s 2019 record of landing on the far side of the moon, and Chang’e-5’s 2020 success returning to Earth with near-side moon samples.
     
            This time, to communicate with Earth from the moon’s far side, Chang’e-6 must rely on the Queqiao-2 satellite, launched into lunar orbit in March.
     
            The probe itself is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module.
     
            The mission plan is for the Chang’e-6’s lander to gather moon dust and rocks after touching down in the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer diameter South Pole-Aitken basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago.
     
            An ascender spacecraft would then transport the samples to the lunar orbiter for transfer to the reentry module and the mission’s return to Earth.
     
            The complex mission “goes through virtually every step” that will be required for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon in the years ahead, according to James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has collaborated with Chinese scientists leading the mission.
     
            In addition to returning samples that could yield “fundamental new insights into the origin and early history of the moon and solar system,” the mission also serves as “robotic practice for these steps” to get astronauts to the moon and back, he said.
     
            China plans to launch two more missions in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon before building a research station in the following decade on the lunar south pole – a region believed to contain water ice.
     
            Chang’e-7, scheduled for 2026, will aim to search for resources on the moon’s south pole, while Chang’e-8 roughly two years later could look at how to utilize lunar materials to prepare for building the research base, Chinese officials have said.
     
            Friday’s launch comes as multiple nations ramp up their lunar programs amid a growing focus on the potential access to resources and further deep space exploration access that successful moon missions could bring.
     
            Last year, India landed its first spacecraft on the moon, while Russia’s first lunar mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon’s surface.
     
            In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole.
     
            That landing – the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades – is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there as soon as 2026 and build its scientific base camp.
     
            NASA administrator Bill Nelson last month appeared to acknowledge that China’s pace – and concerns about its intentions – were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions.
     
            “We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program. I think in effect we are in a race,” Nelson told lawmakers last month, adding his concern that China could try to bar the US or other countries from certain lunar areas if they arrive there first.

            China has long said it stands for the peaceful use of space, and, like the US, has looked to use its space prowess to cultivate international goodwill.
     
            This time, China has said the Chang’e-6 mission carries scientific instruments or payloads from France, Italy, Pakistan and the European Space Agency.
     
            “China hopes to strengthen cooperation with its international counterparts and deepen international cooperation in the space field,” Ge of the CNSA told reporters a day ahead of the launch.

            A highway collapsed in southern China early on Wednesday after days of torrential rain, sending cars plummeting down a hill and killing dozens of people, Chinese state media reported.
     
            At least 48 people were killed following the collapse of a section of the expressway linking Meizhou city with Dabu county in Guangdong province, according to Ma Zhengyong, Communist Party secretary of Meizhou city.
     
            Some 23 vehicles had been recovered as rescue work continued Thursday, while 30 injured people remain in hospital in stable condition, CCTV said.
     
            The Guangdong provincial government had sent a rescue team of about 500 people, the state broadcaster said.
     
            More than 184 square meters of the highway disintegrated, officials told state news agency Xinhua.

            The incident sparked calls to strengthen inspection and reinforcement work of infrastructure to cope with increasingly extreme weather conditions, state media have reported.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned of the “widespread rainfall and strong atmospheric convection” – a cause of unstable weather – saying it could subject the country to more frequent accidents and natural disasters, Xinhua reported, citing an instruction he gave.
     
            Xi ordered authorities to improve alert systems, strengthen emergency planing and identify potential risks.
     
            Extreme weather around the world is becoming more intense and more frequent against the backdrop of a very fast-warming climate.
     
            Southern China has been bombarded with heavy rain in recent weeks.
     
            Guangdong, an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people, has seen widespread flooding that has forced more than 110,000 people to relocate, state media reported, citing the local government.
     
            The floods have killed at least four people in Guangdong, including a rescue worker, Xinhua reported Monday. At least 10 people remain missing, it added.

            The United States imposed sanctions on more than a dozen companies in China and Hong Kong for their support of Russia’s war in Ukraine as part of a tranche of nearly 300 new sanctions unveiled Wednesday.
     
            The move comes after repeated warnings from top US officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to top Chinese officials that they must crack down on China’s provision of dual-use items to Russia that the US says are being used to strengthen its military in the war against Ukraine.
     
            “The almost 300 targets being sanctioned by both Treasury and the Department of State include sanctions on dozens of actors that have enabled Russia to acquire desperately needed technology and equipment from abroad,” the Treasury Department said in a news release.
     
            The sanctions also hit targets within Russia, as well as Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
     
            The sanctions are aimed at cracking down on sanctions evasion and support for Russia’s military-industrial base and its biological and chemical weapons programs. The Treasury Department also targeted those involved in providing precursor materials to Russia used in explosives.
     
            According to a State Department fact sheet, its sanctions hit Chinese “entities responsible for developing, and supplying dual-use aerospace, manufacturing, and technology equipment to entities based in Russia.”
     
            “Specifically, these designations target producers and exporters of items critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base, some of whom have shipped goods to U.S.- designated entities in Russia,” the fact sheet said.
     
            The Biden administration has increasingly sounded the alarm about China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base – support that the US says has allowed Moscow to continue its war against Ukraine.
     
            Moreover, as Russia has begun to build back its defense capabilities, the US has sought to rally allies to pressure Beijing – via diplomatic means or, if that fails, punitive measures – to stop providing the support, and they are looking to see if that pressure has or will have an impact.
     
            “Russia is no longer kind of on its back foot,” a senior State Department official said before Blinken’s trip to China. “They are surging. They have substantial assets, they reconstituted. They that pose a threat not just to Ukraine but to the wider region.”
     
            The top US diplomat said following a day of meetings in Beijing that “when it comes to China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base, all I can tell you is I was extremely clear about our concerns in some detail, but we’ll have to see what actions follow from that. “
     
            “It is absolutely critical that the support that it’s providing – not in terms of weapons but components for the defense industrial base – again, things like machine tools, microelectronics, where it is overwhelmingly the number-one supplier to Russia. That’s having a material effect in Ukraine and against Ukraine, but it’s also having a material effect in creating a growing that Russia poses to countries in Europe and something that has captured their attention in a very intense way,” he said last week.
     
            Despite those conversations, there is little sign that Beijing intends to heed the US warnings.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/china/china-navy-newest-aircraft-carrier-fujian-sea-trial-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,China’s newest aircraft carrier heads to sea for first time,"China’s newest, largest and most-advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, took a big step to joining the world’s largest naval fleet on Wednesday as it set out from Shanghai for its first sea trials.","May 1, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Brad Lendon,China,"
            China’s newest, largest and most-advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, took a big step to joining the world’s largest naval fleet on Wednesday as it set out from Shanghai for its first sea trials.
     
            The naval assessment is expected to take place in the East China Sea, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the Jiangnan Shipyard where the carrier has been under construction for more than six years, according to Shanghai’s Maritime Safety Administration.
     
            “The sea trials will primarily test the reliability and stability of the aircraft carrier’s propulsion and electrical systems,” read an announcement from the state-run Xinhua news agency on Wednesday.
     
            The warship was launched in 2022 and has “completed its mooring trials, outfitting work and equipment adjustments” working up to the latest sea trials, Xinhua said.
     
            With a displacement of 80,000 metric tons, the Fujian dwarfs the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) two active carriers, the 66,000-ton Shandong and the 60,000-ton Liaoning. Only the United States Navy operates bigger aircraft carriers than Fujian.
     
            “The Fujian’s sea trials represent an important milestone for the PLAN, marking its entry into the small club of top-class carrier aviation-capable navies,” said John Bradford, a Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs fellow.
     
            The Fujian’s key feature is an electromagnetic catapult system that will enable it to launch larger and heavier aircraft than the Shandong and Liaoning, which use a ski-jump style launch method.
     
            Analysts say the Fujian’s ability to launch larger warplanes carrying higher munitions loads to farther distances will give the carrier a greater combat range than its predecessors in the Chinese fleet, providing the PLAN with so-called “blue-water” capabilities.
     
            “These sea trials mark the first major step in China’s developing the capacity to project sea-based air power into deep ocean areas,” said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.
     
            The electromagnetic catapult system puts the Fujian on par with the US Navy’s newest carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, the only active carrier in the world with an electromagnetic catapult system. The US Navy’s 10 older carriers, the Nimitz class, rely on steam-powered catapults to launch aircraft.

Expert’s warning to US Navy on China: Bigger fleet almost always wins
 
            All the US carriers, however, will retain two key advantages over the Fujian: power and size.
     
            The US carriers are nuclear powered, giving them the ability to remain at sea for as long as crew provisions last, while the Fujian is powered by conventional fuel, meaning it must either make a port call or be met by a tanker at sea to refuel.
     
            As for the US Navy’s size advantage over the Fujian, the Ford displaces 100,000 tons and the 10 Nimitz-class ships 87,000 metric tons. The larger US ships can take on more aircraft, around 75 compared to an expected complement of 60 on the Fujian, according to estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
     
            Analysts have also noted that the US carriers have more catapults, a larger airway and more elevators to allow for quicker deployment of aircraft from the hangar deck below.
     
            The US carriers “remain in an echelon of their own,” Bradford said.
     
            Schuster said the current round of sea trials for Fujian are expected to last three to six days and would not include flight operations.
     
            “Radars and communications equipment will get some testing, but the first sea trials always focus on hull integrity, propulsion and engineering since problems there prevent everything else from working well,” Schuster said.
     
            In total, analysts expect the Fujian’s sea trials to take at least a year, with its commissioning likely to come next year or in 2026. A story on the website of the Chinese Defense Ministry in January noted the Liaoning underwent 10 sea trials and the Shandong nine before entering service.

            When it joins the PLAN fleet, the Fujian will become the icon of what is now the world’s largest naval force,with more than 340 warships and counting as Chinese shipyards turn out new warships at a frenetic pace.
     
            “It will be the most visible symbol of China’s growing naval power,” said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the CSIS.
     
            Meanwhile, the announcement of a fourth carrier for the Chinese fleet could come soon, PLAN political commissar Yuan Huazhi said in March, according to a report in the state-run Global Times.
     
            When that announcement is made, the answer as to whether China will have a nuclear-powered carrier will be answered, the report said.
     
            The US Navy already has three new Ford-class carriers under construction, the future John F Kennedy, Enterprise and Doris Miller.

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            In the early days of 2020, as science looked for answers to a mysterious viral outbreak in central China, a prominent Chinese virologist stepped forward to share critical data with the world.
     
            Zhang Yongzhen’s disclosure of the genome of the virus that causes Covid-19 was a crucial step in the race to combat the pandemic, helping researchers globally to identify the pathogen and create vaccines to counter it.
     
            He was lauded for his integrity by the scientific community, but in the years since, people who know Zhang say he has faced a series of unprecedented roadblocks in his career in China – with yet another barrier placed in front of his research over the past week.
     
            On Sunday and Monday, Zhang, 59, slept overnight in protest outside his lab at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center after administrators closed the facility abruptly for renovations, according to accounts posted on his Weibo social media page.
     
            A post on his page early Wednesday said a “tentative agreement” had been reached for Zhang’s team to resume their scientific work at the lab, some of which is related to tracing the origins of Covid-19.
     
            The ordeal is just the latest hindrance to Zhang’s research since 2020, according to a colleague who has been in contact with the Chinese scientist in recent years.
     
            An account by Zhang’s research students posted online also laid out a litany of challenges faced by the scientist since the formal transfer of his official employment to the Shanghai center in 2020, when his 19-year tenure at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also ended.
     
            Their account, reposted on Zhang’s Weibo page and seen by CNN, has since been deleted. It alleges the Shanghai center, which is affiliated with the city’s Fudan University, failed to formally recognize Zhang’s employment, leaving him without social security and medical benefits, and that it prematurely terminated a five-year cooperation agreement with the scientist.
     
            “That a top scientist in his field, a person who has made contributions to the country and mankind should have fallen to this point – is really sad and chilling,” the post read.

            In a statement Monday, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center said it had closed some labs for renovation due to safety concerns and claimed it had provided additional office and experimental spaces for Zhang and his team.
     
            The “institute always respects … and supports scientific researchers and students in carrying out normal research work,” the statement said.
     
            Images posted on social media this week appeared to show Zhang wrapped in blankets and sleeping on the doorstep of the lab building as security guards hovered over him.
     
            Reached briefly by phone on Monday, Zhang told CNN the center’s explanation that the lab needed renovation and there was ample notification of the move was “nonsense.”
     
            More than a dozen students’ research had been impacted by the lab closure, he said, adding it was “inconvenient” to say more at that time.
     
            In his post Wednesday, Zhang said his team would “discuss with the (center) the future relocation plan of the laboratory, the guarantee of normal life and scientific research work for students during the transition period,” and work to resolve issues related to his own agreements with the center. CNN was unable to independently confirm his post.
     
            The earlier post by Zhang’s students said the two days originally allocated by the center for them to move their scientific work was insufficient. Their lab had been renovated as recently as 2020 and a second lab hadn’t been in use since the pandemic, they added.
     
            Neither Zhang nor the online post detailing the circumstances leading to his protest connected the lab closure to his sharing of the coronavirus genome sequence in 2020.
     
            Multiple calls from CNN to the public relations department of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center went unanswered on Tuesday.
     
            Zhang became the first scientist to share Covid-19’s genomic sequence on January 11, 2020 as the World Health Organization waited for China to provide the data following its announcement nearly two weeks earlier of a viral outbreak in the central city of Wuhan.
     
            He was hailed internationally for his work and named by Nature as one of 10 people who helped shape science in 2020.
     
            In an interview with the journal that year, Zhang reflected on his global recognition.
     
            “They say, ‘January 11 was a turning point for understanding that this is serious. It was a turning point for China. It was a turning point for the world,’” he said.
     
            But in China, Zhang faced challenges to his work that stemmed from that moment, according to his long-time collaborator Edward Holmes, a University of Sydney professor who published the genome with Zhang’s permission on an international data sharing website.
     
            Following the release of the data, Zhang’s lab had limitations placed on it, which barred it from isolating the Covid virus, Holmes said.

            It’s unclear if this move was separate from a Chinese government “rectification” order received by Zhang’s team that reports at the time said resulted in the temporary closure of the lab a day after the sequence release. Zhang told Nature in 2020 that the order merely required his lab to update its biosafety protocols after moving equipment during construction work.
     
            Zhang, a scientist with China’s CDC since 2001, was also forced out of the agency in September 2020, according to a person familiar with the situation.
     
            CNN approached China’s National Health Commission, which oversees the CDC, for comment.
     
            These changes for Zhang came as China – already known for top-down control on the academic sector – tightened oversight of scientific information related to the virus. That included imposing restrictions by April 2020 on the publication of academic research on the origins of the novel coronavirus.
     
            Beijing has repeatedly defended its scientific transparency and data sharing related to the outbreak.
     
            “The idea that (Zhang) would do anything anti-China is ridiculous given his (national) pride. But clearly the government wanted a certain message to be conveyed, a certain narrative to be put out on the outbreak in Wuhan … by releasing the sequence of the virus he broke that instruction – and it all stems from that,” Holmes told CNN on Monday.
     
            “In the old days, pre-Covid … he was like a machine and now the machine is broken. He’s just been slowly crushed by this.”
     
            In the months after he shared the Covid-19 sequence, Zhang’s employment was transferred to the Shanghai Public Health Center, where he had held a five-year cooperation agreement and part-time professorship since 2018. It’s unclear if this move was already in the works prior to January 2020.
     
            Since then, he has continued to publish in journals such as Cell and Nature Microbiology on the presence of viruses in animals and nature in China and received at least two international awards.
     
            The most recent of his international publications in March looked at coronavirus variants in Shanghai in the initial months of the Covid-19 outbreak, and Zhang’s team continues to work on research related to the virus and its emergence.
     
            Ongoing research includes a National Natural Science Foundation of China project at the laboratory, the post said.

            In a Weibo post on January 11 marking the fourth anniversary of his Covid disclosure, Zhang appeared to allude to the challenges he has faced in the years since.
     
            “Four years ago this morning, on behalf of the research team, we insisted on putting life first and made the right choice,” Zhang wrote.
     
            “Despite going through continuous ups and downs, experiencing the warmth and cold of human emotion, and the harshness of the world, we have no regrets.”
     
            But recent years have taken a steep toll on Zhang, according to Holmes.
     
            “He’s not the same in terms of his productivity, he’s completely different – not the same person at all. It’s just been extraordinary to watch and extraordinary that it’s come to this,” he said.
     
            Holmes, who had limited email contact with Zhang during his protest this week, said the Chinese virologist had told him he recently failed in his pursuit of a legal case against the Shanghai center for its handling of his contract.
     
            “(All this has) gone on for a long time … but I hadn’t realized how bad it had got,” Holmes said.

            Like hundreds of millions of workers in China, Hao Zeyu, an algorithm engineer at an electric vehicle maker, is getting five days off this week for the Labor Day holiday. But he’s in no mood to party.
     
            In order to take the vacation, Hao is required to work an extra day on each weekend immediately before and after the break.
     
            To add insult to injury, two of the official vacation days fall on Saturday and Sunday. That means just one of those five days counts as a genuine holiday.
     
            The practice of moving workdays to weekends to create a longer vacation during major Chinese holidays is known as “tiaoxiu” or adjusted rest. Introduced in 1999 to stimulate consumer spending following the Asian financial crisis, it has been the subject of much online anger in the weeks leading up to this year’s May 1 holiday.
     
            “I really don’t like it,” Hao told CNN. “I think this policy was meant to promote consumption at a certain stage of the country’s development, but I very much do not support it anymore,” he added.
     
            So, why has a decades-old policy caused so much upset in a country whose Communist Party leadership pays annual homage to International Workers’ Day?
     
            Workers say a post-Covid slump in the world’s second largest economy means they are increasingly afraid of losing their jobs if they dare to ask for extra leave on top of the officially sanctioned holidays — which they had previously felt comfortable doing.
     
            And they say they’re being asked to work harder than ever because their employers are trying to do more with fewer resources as economic misery — a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — piles up.
     
            In recent weeks, complaints about this year’s Labor Day leave arrangements have exploded on Chinese social media. Many have slammed the government for prioritizing business over something they desperately need, which is an actual break.
     
            People have been venting their frustration under the hashtags “you should not pretend not to hear voices opposing the tiaoxiu policy” and “tiaoxiu policy for May Day,” which have collectively drawn more than 560 million views combined.
     
            One user wrote the online discussion was not merely a policy debate, it’s an embodiment of “physical and mental exhaustion caused by crazy overtime work.”
     
            “What we are longing for is an effective rest that is urgently needed from overworking,” the person added.
     
            Another person wrote on social media platform Weibo that they “want more holidays not shifting things around in order to get those long holidays.”
     
            “Who will have the mood to spend money if they don’t have (real) holidays?” the person wrote.
     
            To make things worse, the “orchestrated” vacations often result in a scramble for hard-to-get train tickets, inflated hotel deals and chaos at popular tourist spots, Hao told CNN.
     
            Labor Day isn’t the only holiday to get the adjusted rest policy.
     
            The authorities also shuffle workdays around the Spring Festival, celebrated in January or February, and National Day, which takes place on October 1, to create seven-day breaks known as “Golden Weeks.”
     
            Christian Yao, a senior lecturer at the University of Wellington, said China’s economy is “in the middle of very bumpy years” as it strives to transform itself from a manufacturing powerhouse into a knowledge-based economy.

            He said workers are beginning to question where the country is heading. The slowing economy has, in turn, put pressure on companies to improve their productivity while cutting costs.
     
            “Workers are forced to work harder, afraid of losing jobs and at the same time afraid of whether finding another job is going to offer them better pay,” he said.
     
            Even though some workers are used to working long hours under China’s “996” work culture — the practice of working from 9 am to 9 pm six days a week that is common among the country’s tech companies, startups and other private businesses — others are now refusing to put up with the adjusted work policy, Yao said.
     
            With the policy, China is able to designate more than 25 days as official holidays. Without the maneuvering though, workers get 11 days, which is still in line with many other countries. The United States, for instance, offers 11 federal holidays while the United Kingdom has eight days.
     
            But the problem for Chinese workers is that their statutory paid time off (PTO), or annual leave, is just five days a year, which is much less than many other countries.
     
            When times were good, Chinese companies were more generous in granting those PTO days. But it’s a different story during an economic slowdown.
     
            Max Teng, a business analyst in the internet industry, told CNN that he used to work for a foreign company. But the truth is it was no better, he said.
     
            “If you take a long leave, everyone will have some negative feedback for you. So many people do not dare to take leave even if it’s offered,” he said.
     
            A minority of companies are doing things their own way. Yaer Tuerdi, 26, works in the marketing division of Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is run by fast food giant Yum China (YUMC).
     
            Yum China doesn’t require workers to come in during the two designated “special working days.”
     
            “I like it,” said Tuerdi. “You can arrange your break freely … If you want to travel, you can take annual leave to make up for the gap. If you don’t want to travel, you can still have two days of rest on the weekend.”
     
            A movement among independent businesses is pushing back on the obsession of excessively long work hours. Among the more prominent proponents is Pang Dong Lai, a supermarket chain known for its customer service based in the central province of Henan.
     
            In March, its founder and chairman Yu Donglai announced he was offering 10 days a year of “sadness leave” for employees who did not feel up to working, state media People’s Daily reported.
     
            “Everyone feels down inevitably every now and then and if they can have this sadness leave, they may feel good again,” it quoted him as saying. Managers, Yu added, cannot reject such leave applications.
     
            He has been one of the rare advocates of work-life balance in a culture that prizes “eating bitterness,” or enduring hardship to succeed, and often speaks at business forums to preach his beliefs.
     
            CNN has contacted the supermarket chain to ask about its Labor Day plans.
     
            As for Teng, he will have to work on May 11, a Saturday, as part of the standard holiday arrangement.
     
            “I feel very depressed because I have to work at least six days in a row,” he said.

            Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index surged more than 7% in April as the best-performing major index in the world. It’s now heading into a bull market, rebounding nearly 20% from its January low.
 
            The rebound marks a sharp turnaround after a weak start to 2024 and years of heavy losses, which saw more than $3 trillion wiped off the value of the city’s stock market as global investors grew increasingly skeptical about China’s economic future and worried about geopolitical tensions with the United States.
     
            But an improving economic landscape in China, cheaper valuations and a flurry of mainland investors putting money into Hong Kong to protect their portfolios from a weakening Chinese currency have combined to resuscitate the market.
     
            “Foreign inflows have started to come back with the bottoming of the [Chinese] economy,” said Kelly Chung, chief investment officer for multi assets at Value Partners, a Hong Kong-based asset management firm.
     
            The valuation of Hong Kong stocks has also become more “compelling” relative to the rest of the Asian region after the pullback last year, said Zhikai Chen, head of Asian equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management. He added that there is a shift in investors’ sentiments as Chinese economic data turned more positive.
     
            In recent days, investors have been getting increasingly upbeat because of reports that Beijing would roll out a “real solution” for the crisis-ridden property sector.
     
            “Attention is squarely on China’s property market, seen as the linchpin of the country’s economic stability,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.
     
            “Recent policy measures, ranging from lifting restrictions on homebuyers to providing support for developers’ funding needs, underscore the government’s commitment to bolstering this critical sector in 2024,” he said.
     
            There are signs that China’s economy might be bottoming out.
     
            Manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in 14 months in April, according to a private survey released on Tuesday.
     
            The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 51.4 in April from 51.1 in March, marking the sixth consecutive month of expansion, as new export orders recorded a solid increase because of improving global demand.
     CNN's Marc Stewart joins Julia Chatterley to discuss the latest GDP numbers from Beijing.

            In the first quarter, China’s gross domestic product grew 5.3% from a year ago, thanks to robust growth in high-tech manufacturing.
     
            “The PMIs, which are a leading economic indicator, suggest improving momentum since the start of the year,” said David Chao, global market strategist at Invesco.
     
            “Heading into the middle of the year, the recent PMIs are in much better territory when compared to a year ago, and I think this is due to fiscal and monetary stimulus working their way into the economy,” he said.
     
            Earlier this month, news outlet Caixin reported that Beijing is learning from Japan’s experience of decades of stagnation and is considering launching a national platform to acquire unfinished housing projects across the country. These projects would then be turned into affordable housing and the units would be sold or rented out.
     
            “[This] is largely consistent with what we have long believed would be the most effective way to rescue the property sector,” said Nomura analysts on Monday.
     
            “The Caixin report suggests Beijing is edging closer to a real solution for the property sector,” they added.
     
            Chinese equities listed in Hong Kong are also appearing to be more attractive, particularly in comparison to Indian markets, which have been booming on the back of robust economic growth.
     
            “We are observing investors starting to view India’s valuation as ‘expensive,’ and outflows have been seen from India to China [equities],” Angelina Lai, chief investment officer at St James’s Place, wrote in her quarterly market update earlier this month.
     
            “Although the macro picture in China is unpromising, the steep fall in Chinese equities has pushed the local equity risk premium above the trend,” she said.
     
            Innes said global investors are currently “underweight” in Chinese markets, including Hong Kong, because of geopolitical tensions and concerns surrounding potential fallout from the upcoming US elections.
     
            However, such market surges typically trigger “the fear of missing out (FOMO)”, especially given the attractive valuation of Chinese stocks compared to their US counterparts.
     
            “As a result, we may see a global rotation of funds into Chinese equities, indicating that the current rally could have further momentum to sustain its upward trajectory,” he added.
     
            Hong Kong has also seen strong inflows of money from mainland China, where investors are concerned about further depreciation of the Chinese currency and mainland assets, according to BNP Paribas’ analysts.
     
            The yuan has lost 4% of its value against the US dollar in the past year.

China’s consumer prices rise for first time in six months. But it’s too soon to say deflation is over
 
            While other major central banks have kept their monetary policies tight to control inflation, the People’s Bank of China has cut rates multiple times and pledged to maintain ample liquidity this year to fight deflation.
     
            Stock exchange data showed that southbound investors (meaning investment from mainland China into Hong Kong) have bought nearly $20 billion of Hong Kong-listed stocks in March and the first three weeks of April on a net basis.
     
            “We believe southbound investors could be using HK-listed equities to diversify their currency exposure in light of rising RMB depreciation pressure due to US-China interest rate differentials,” analysts from BNP Paribus said last week.
     
            “In our view, mainland Chinese investors often prefer to diversify their holdings to non-RMB denominated assets (eg HK-listed shares and commodities) during periods of RMB depreciation,” they said, adding that depreciation pressure on the yuan could continue for the rest of the year.

            China’s coast guard fired water cannons that damaged a Philippine vessel on Tuesday, marking the latest flare-up of violence between the two countries in the disputed South China Sea, Philippine authorities said.
     
            The Philippine Coast Guard said the incident occurred as one of its ships and a fisheries agency vessel carried out a “legitimate patrol” near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese-controlled rocky outcrop 130 miles (200 kilometers) west of the main Philippine island of Luzon and inside Manila’s exclusive economic zone.
     
            Video supplied by the Philippine Coast Guard showed two larger Chinese vessels firing water cannons from opposite sides of the Philippine ship.
     
            “The Philippine vessels encountered dangerous maneuvers and obstruction from four China Coast Guard vessels and six Chinese Maritime Militia vessels,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in the statement.
     
            The Philippine Coast Guard ship suffered “damage to the railing and canopy,” according to its statement. No injuries were reported.
     
            In a post on social platform Weibo Tuesday, the China Coast Guard said it had expelled the Philippine vessels for “intruding” into the waters, “in accordance with the law.”
     
Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.

            Scarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island and is also known as Bajo de Masinloc, is a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground.
     
            There are no structures on the shoal, but China has maintained a continuous coast guard presence around it since 2012, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
     
            The Philippines also said Tuesday that China had reinstalled a 380-meter (1,247-feet) floating barrier that “covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.”
     
            Scarborough Shoal is one of several disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which have long been a flashpoint of territorial disputes between the two nations.
     
            In March, Chinese coast guard ships fired water cannons against a Philippine vessel on a resupply mission to a contingent of Filipino marines on another contested South China Sea feature, Second Thomas Shoal, causing “heavy damages.”
     
            That shoal sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era transport ship called the BRP Sierra Madre on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is staffed by marines stationed on rotation.
     
            Following that incident, the China Coast Guard said on Weibo it had taken “control measures in accordance with the law” against the Philippine vessels, which it said had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef,” as Beijing calls Second Thomas Shoal.
     
            Earlier in March, Chinese water cannon hit a Philippine resupply boat as it headed to Second Thomas Shoal, shattering windows and injuring four Filipino sailors.
     
            Beijing and Manila’s South China Sea disputes have heated up since the 2022 election of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has taken a stronger line against China than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.
     
            The clashes have also raised fears they could lead to a wider conflict, as Manila maintains a mutual defense treaty with the United States, which Washington says covers Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway.

            China launched an uncrewed lunar mission Friday that aims to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time, in a potentially major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe – China’s most complex robotic lunar mission to date – blasted off on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China’s Hainan island, where space fans had gathered to watch the historic moment. The country’s National Space Administration said the launch was a success.
     
            The launch marks the start of a mission that aims to be a key milestone in China’s push to become a dominant space power with plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research base on its south pole.
     
            It comes as a growing number of countries, including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field.
     
            China’s planned 53-day mission would see the Chang’e-6 lander touch down in a gaping crater on the moon’s far side, which never faces Earth. China became the first and only country to land on the moon’s far side during its 2019 Chang’e-4 mission.
     
            Any far-side samples retrieved by the Chang’e-6 lander could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon and the solar system itself – and provide important data to advance China’s lunar ambitions.
     
            “The Chang’e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology of the moon’s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent technologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,” Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administration’s (CNSA) Center of Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering said last week from the launch site.
     
            The Chang’e-6 probe will be a key test for China’s space capabilities in its effort to realize leader Xi Jinping’s “eternal dream” of building the country into a space power.
     
            China has made rapid space advancements in recent years, in a field traditionally led by the United States and Russia.
     
            With the Chang’e program, launched in 2007 and named for the moon goddess of Chinese mythology, China in 2013 became the first country to achieve a robotic lunar landing in nearly four decades. In 2022, China completed its own orbital space station, the Tiangong.
 
            The technically complex Chang’e-6 mission builds on both the Chang’e-4’s 2019 record of landing on the far side of the moon, and Chang’e-5’s 2020 success returning to Earth with near-side moon samples.
     
            This time, to communicate with Earth from the moon’s far side, Chang’e-6 must rely on the Queqiao-2 satellite, launched into lunar orbit in March.
     
            The probe itself is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module.
     
            The mission plan is for the Chang’e-6’s lander to gather moon dust and rocks after touching down in the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer diameter South Pole-Aitken basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago.
     
            An ascender spacecraft would then transport the samples to the lunar orbiter for transfer to the reentry module and the mission’s return to Earth.
     
            The complex mission “goes through virtually every step” that will be required for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon in the years ahead, according to James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has collaborated with Chinese scientists leading the mission.
     
            In addition to returning samples that could yield “fundamental new insights into the origin and early history of the moon and solar system,” the mission also serves as “robotic practice for these steps” to get astronauts to the moon and back, he said.
     
            China plans to launch two more missions in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon before building a research station in the following decade on the lunar south pole – a region believed to contain water ice.
     
            Chang’e-7, scheduled for 2026, will aim to search for resources on the moon’s south pole, while Chang’e-8 roughly two years later could look at how to utilize lunar materials to prepare for building the research base, Chinese officials have said.
     
            Friday’s launch comes as multiple nations ramp up their lunar programs amid a growing focus on the potential access to resources and further deep space exploration access that successful moon missions could bring.
     
            Last year, India landed its first spacecraft on the moon, while Russia’s first lunar mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon’s surface.
     
            In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole.
     
            That landing – the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades – is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there as soon as 2026 and build its scientific base camp.
     
            NASA administrator Bill Nelson last month appeared to acknowledge that China’s pace – and concerns about its intentions – were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions.
     
            “We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program. I think in effect we are in a race,” Nelson told lawmakers last month, adding his concern that China could try to bar the US or other countries from certain lunar areas if they arrive there first.

            Multiple days of heavy rains have lashed southern China, unleashing deadly floods and threatening to upend the lives of tens of millions of people as rescuers rush to evacuate residents trapped by rising waters.
     
            Guangdong province, an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people, has seen widespread flooding that has forced more than 110,000 people to be relocated, state media reported, citing the local government.
     
            The floods have killed at least four people in Guangdong, including a rescue worker, state news agency Xinhua reported Monday. At least 10 people remain missing, it added.
     
            Since April 16, sustained torrential rains have pounded the Pearl River Delta, China’s manufacturing heartland and one of the country’s most populated regions, with four weather stations in Guangdong registering record rainfall for April.
     
            The Pearl River basin is subject to annual flooding from April to September, but the region has faced more intense rainstorms and severe floods in recent years as scientists warn that the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent.
     
            “Judging from the flood control situation in recent years, climate warming and temperature rise have intensified, and extreme heavy rainfall occurs every year, leading to torrential rains and floods,” Yin Zhijie, chief hydrological forecaster at the Ministry of Water Resources, told state-run outlet The Paper.
     
            Last year, China encountered “more intense and extreme” downpours during the flood season than in previous years, with 72 national weather stations registering record daily rainfall and 346 stations breaking monthly records, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
     
            Since last week, at least 44 rivers in the Pearl River basin have swelled above the warning line, threatening to burst their banks, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            On the Bei River, which flows into the Pearl River, authorities have warned of a “once a century” flood expected to reach 5.8 meters (19 feet) above the warning limit. The tributary had already burst its banks on April 8, marking the earliest arrival of its annual flood season since records began in 1998, according to Guangdong authorities.

            The “massive flood” at the Bei River is the earliest on record to hit China in the highest category of a four-tier classification system, according to Yin, the forecaster. Floods of this magnitude usually occur after late June, he said.
     
            Aerial footage aired by CCTV on the weekend showed villages inundated by murky flood waters, with only roofs and treetops visible in some places.
     
            In Guangning county, Zhaoqing city, footage shared by residents on short video app Douyin shows muddy brown water gushing through village streets and sweeping away cars. In Shaoguan, a man is seen pushing his scooter through shoulder-high flood waters. And in Qingyuan city, social media footage shows strong gales and rain felling trees and flipping over motorcycles.
     
            The heavy downpours have also triggered landslides near Shaoguan city in the province’s mountainous north, injuring six people, according to Xinhua.
     
            Authorities raised the flood control emergency response for the Pearl River Delta to level 2 on Sunday – the second highest in a four-tier system.
     
            Many cities have suspended schools and hundreds of flights have been canceled in the metropolises of Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
     
            More than 80 houses have either collapsed or been severely damaged, resulting in a direct economic loss of nearly 140 million yuan ($20 million), Xinhua reported.
     
            Further heavy rainfall is expected to hit Guangdong this week, according to the province’s Meteorological Bureau.

China has accused the United States of “stoking military confrontation” with the recent deployment of a powerful missile launcher capable of firing weapons with a range of up to 1,600 kilometers to exercises in the Philippines.
     
            The US Army’s Mid-Range Capability (MRC) ground-based missile system arrives in a region on edge following a series of dangerous Chinese-Philippine face-offs in the South China Sea, during which Philippine ships have been targeted with water cannons, injuring several Filipino sailors.
     
            It’s the first-ever deployment of the MRC missile system, also known as the Typhon system, to the Indo-Pacific theater, and it comes amid a series of US-Philippine military exercises, including the largest-ever edition of the annual bilateral Balikatan drills beginning Monday.
     
            The US Army has not said how long the Typhon system will remain in the Philippines, but its involvement in the series of joint exercises between the two treaty allies, the first of which began on April 8, sends a signal the US can put offensive weaponry well within striking distance of Chinese installations in the South China Sea, the southern Chinese mainland and along the Taiwan Strait, analysts say.
     
            The Typhon system is capable of firing the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), a ballistic missile defense munition that can also target ships at sea at a range of 370 kilometers (230 miles), according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
     
            It also can fire the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, a maneuverable cruise missile with a range of 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles), according to the CSIS.
     
            According to Beijing its presence in the region increases the risks of “misjudgment and miscalculation.”
     
            During a regular news briefing last week, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused the US of seeking a “unilateral military advantage,” and underscored Beijing’s strong opposition to the deployment.
     
            “We urge the US to earnestly respect other countries’ security concerns, stop stoking military confrontation, stop undermining peace and stability in the region, and take concrete actions to reduce strategic risks,” Lin said.
     
            The US Army is calling the deployment, which began April 11 for the Salaknib exercise, a “landmark” in its regional capability.
     
            The apparent diplomatic fallout comes as attendees from 29 countries, including the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, attend a two-day Western Pacific Naval Symposium, which began in the eastern Chinese port city of Qingdao on Sunday.
     
            The attendees will discuss “maritime peace, maritime order based on maritime security cooperation and international laws, and global maritime governance,” according to Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency.
     
            Those are the same rules Washington and Manila accuse Beijing of ignoring with aggressive Chinese actions that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged vessels around disputed features in the South China Sea.
     
            The 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines – the oldest such US pact in Asia-Pacific – stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.
     
            In brief comments to CNN on the sidelines of the gathering, US Adm. Stephen Koehler said: “I think it’s a great opportunity for all navies to get together and discuss all the issues.”
     
            Analysts say the deployment of the Typhon missile battery is the first signal of US plans to address what has long been an advantage for Beijing in the region.
     
            “This in some way ‘equalizes’ the prior situation where (Chinese) missiles have threatened US forces along the First Island Chain (which includes the northern Philippines, Japan and Taiwan), and even further eastward along the Second Island Chain centering on Guam,” said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

US tests hypersonic missile in Pacific as it aims to keep up with China and Russia
 
            A 2021 report for the US Army’s professional journal Military Review puts the current missile advantage of the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) in stark terms.
     
            “The conventional arm of the PLARF is the largest ground-based missile force in the world, with over 2,200 conventionally armed ballistic and cruise missiles and with enough antiship missiles to attack every US surface combatant vessel in the South China Sea with enough firepower to overcome each ship’s missile defense,” Army Maj. Christopher Milhal wrote.
     
            While the Typhon can’t bring those kinds of numbers into play for US forces, its mobility represents a problem for Chinese mission planners — giving it important deterrent value, analysts say.
     
            In announcing the Typhon deployment, the US military noted how the system was delivered to the Philippines via an 8,000-mile, 15-hour flight from Washington state by a US Air Force C-17 cargo jet.
     
            Analysts don’t expect the Typhon system to be permanently based in the Philippines, but Koh said the ability to move the batteries to a range of “pre-surveyed launch sites” around the region on short notice increases their survivability and challenges relatively new and untested Chinese intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting capabilities.
     
            Whether the Typhon’s likely temporary status mitigates the fallout remains unknown. but China has previously reacted furiously to missile deployments in what it sees as its backyard.
     
            Writing in the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Military Balance Blog, analyst Rupert Schulenberg noted that in 2016, when South Korea agreed to the deployment of a THAAD defensive missile system on the Korean Peninsula, “Beijing responded with an unofficial economic boycott that cost South Korea’s economy $7.5 billion in 2017 alone.”
     
            The current deployment of the Typhon was something that would not have even been an option for the US military until 2019. Development of ground-launched missile systems of the type were banned under the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the US and the Soviet Union.
     
            But the US formally withdrew from the treaty in 2019, with then-President Donald Trump “citing Russian noncompliance and concerns about China’s intermediate-range missile arsenal.”
     
            Meanwhile, the US and the Philippines kicked-off the largest of their series of joint exercises Monday, with the three-week Balikatan drills — Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder — involving thousands of military personnel.
     
            A report from the official Philippine News Agency said Manila would use the annual exercises to showcase its military’s most advanced systems, including a missile frigate, light fighter jets, close-combat support aircraft and Black Hawk helicopters.
     
            Philippine officials previously indicated the naval portion of the exercise would for the first time extend beyond the 12-nautical-mile limit of Philippine waters — and into the country’s exclusive economic zone, some 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from Philippine shores, though no exact route has been provided.
     
            It will also include French naval participation in a group sail from Palawan Island, according to Philippine officials.
     
            Palawan, which sits between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is about 200 kilometers from Second Thomas Shoal, a contested feature in the Spratly Islands that has been the site of numerous face-offs between Philippine and Chinese coast guard vessels.

            A shiny new high-speed railway station is usually a highly anticipated affair in China – but this one is causing controversy online thanks to its eye-catching design.
     
            According to a report in Chinese state media, construction on the upcoming Nanjing North Railway Station will begin in the first half of this year.
     
            The report cites officials as saying the design was inspired by the Yangtze River, which flows through the city, and by blooming flowers.
     
Nanjing, capital of eastern Jiangsu province, is famous for its plum blossoms, which bloom every spring.
     
            However, the responses to the designs, which were released earlier this month, were far from flowery.
     
            Many commenters on Chinese social media site Weibo didn’t see a plum blossom in the design. Instead, many said that they thought it looked like a maxi pad.
     
            “Nanjing North Station modeling renderings resemble sanitary pad. This shape will make people think. Do people feel like they’re leaking out when they exit the station?” one commented.
     
            “Wings to protect Nanjing,” another wrote. “This one should be able to stem any heavy flow (of crowds).”

    Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
 
            In a slick video marking the National Security Education Day, China’s top spy agency has a stern message for Chinese people: foreign spies are everywhere.
     
            As ominous music plays, a broad-faced, beady-eyed man disguises himself as a street fashion photographer, a lab technician, a businessman and a food delivery driver – he even sets up an online honey trap – to glean sensitive state secrets in various places and industries.
     
            “In the sea of people, you may have never noticed him. His identity is changeable and his whereabouts are hard to find,” a narrator says. “They are everywhere, cunning… and sneaky, and they may be right here in our lives.”
     
            Eventually, Chinese police catch the spy in a dramatic ambush after state security authorities receive multiple tip-offs from the public.
     
            “They can disguise as anyone. But among the crowds you and I together are protecting national security,” the narrator concludes. “We 1.4 billion people are 1.4 billion lines of defense.”
     
            The three-minute video is the latest propaganda push by China’s powerful civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), to mentally arm the Chinese public against what it sees as the growing threat of foreign espionage.
     
            Under Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, the country’s notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit.
     
            From a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life.
     
            In Chinese cities, posters and slogans promoting national security are now a common sight on sidewalks, subway trains, campuses and billboards. On social media, the ministry commands a massive following with near-daily commentaries, short videos or even comic strips sounding the alarm about supposedly ubiquitous threats to the country.
     
            According to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything – from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has also posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by American and British spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.
     
            Last week, as part of a documentary to mark National Security Education Day, the MSS revealed that a Chinese scientist convicted of selling state secrets to a foreign intelligence agency was executed in 2016. The documentary did not explicitly mention which country, but its images show an American flag and the US Capitol building.
     
            The MSS’ transformation is part of Xi’s sweeping pivot to ramp up national security in the face of heightened geopolitical tensions and mounting domestic challenges.

Beijing claims US citizen jailed for life in China was decorated spy who worked undetected for decades
 
            As US-China relations fray, the MSS has undertaken significant efforts to provide guidance to other government agencies and broader society, said Xuezhi Guo, a professor of political science at Guilford College in the US.
     
            “These endeavors aim to foster anti-espionage awareness and enhance security measures in light of the evolving landscape of espionage threats,” he said. “The goal is to empower Chinese citizens and entities with the knowledge and skills required to bolster their vigilance and preempt espionage activities effectively.”
     
            The emphasis on external threats also helps Beijing deflect criticism at home over its own policies by shifting blame onto “foreign forces” – a playbook the Chinese government has repeatedly applied during periods of public discontent, most recently over protests in late 2022 against Xi’s hardline measures to prevent Covid.
     
            And the spy agency’s extending reach is a sign of the increasing securitization of Chinese life and society under Xi, where “an incredibly wide array of issues can be viewed as threats to national security,” said Sheena Chestnut Greitens, director of the Asia Policy Program at the University of Texas at Austin.
     
            The MSS was born out of a reassessment of China’s national security needs in the early 1980s, as the country emerged from decades of political upheaval and self-imposed isolation under Chairman Mao Zedong to embrace market reforms and open up to the world.
     
            It was founded in 1983 by merging an intelligence department of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and a counterespionage unit in the police force. It oversees intelligence and counterintelligence both within China and overseas, with provincial and municipal branches extending throughout the country.
     
            It is often likened to a combined CIA and FBI, though the MSS long operated under a heavier veil of secrecy, without an official website or any publicly listed contacts or spokesperson.
     
            But China’s spy agency has gradually stepped out of the shadows as Xi makes national security a key priority.
     
            In 2015, the MSS established its first public point of contact by setting up a hotline and a website to encourage people to report any suspected threats to state security. In the same year, China designated April 15 as National Security Education Day.
     
            And in 2020, the ministry started to churn out promotional materials – from posters to animations – under a dedicated office named the National Security Propaganda Studio.
     
            The following year, the MSS gave an unprecedented written Q&A to state media, introducing its role and recruitment channels to the public for the first time. Later in the year, an official in charge of the spy agency’s educational and propaganda work showed up on the prime-time news program of state broadcaster CCTV – a rare appearance that was noted by state media.
     
            The most drastic move came last August when the agency made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China’s most popular social app, with a rallying call for “all members of society” to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets.
     
            And this year, the ministry dialed up its multimedia activity. In January, it launched a comic strip series called “Shenyin Special Investigation Squad,” featuring a team of five secret police officers hunting down foreign spies – plots it said were inspired by real-life counterespionage operations.
     
            In one installment, a group of foreign-looking characters are tracked by the secret police as they try to extract strategic rare earth metals under the guise of survey work for real estate development; in another, an undercover MSS agent gets a job at a consulting firm to investigate its suspicious deeds, including its connections with experts in key sensitive fields.
     
            “MSS’ decision to establish a social media presence is an anomaly given its traditionally low profile,” said Greitens at the University of Texas, who has studied China’s security apparatus.
     
            One reason for the change may be the minister of state security, Chen Yixin, who was appointed in late 2022, according to Greitens.
     
            Chen is widely seen as a trusted aide of Xi, having served under him for years when Xi was a provincial official in Zhejiang province. And he has a track record of using social media to drive home the official message.
     
            “Chen has been saying for years that new media are important to guide public opinion on the party’s political-legal and national security work. So, part of this appears to be him putting his personal stamp on the Ministry’s work,” Greitens said.
     
            In addition, China’s National Security Commission – a powerful body headed by Xi – approved a document on enhancing public education around national security work last May, which “seems to provide high-level cover for MSS’ course of action here,” she added.
     
            The MSS’s warnings appear aimed at a wide variety of targets.
     
            In one post from last year, the agency said it had discovered hundreds of “illegal” weather stations that were spying for foreign countries, including around sensitive sites such as military bases, defense companies’ property and major grain-producing regions.
     
            In another, the agency warned against commentaries that seek to “denigrate” the Chinese economy through “false narratives” that promote China’s decline – calling such criticism an attempt to attack its socialist system and “strategically contain and suppress China.”
     
            “Things that might have previously been considered purely scientific or purely in the realm of business and economics now have this securitized layer to them,” Greitens said. “Whether it’s the collection of data, or market research by a foreign consulting firm.”
     
            Last May, CCTV reported state security authorities had raided several offices of Capvision, an international consultancy firm with headquarters in Shanghai and New York. It came after authorities raided the Beijing office of US firm Mintz Group, which specializes in corporate due diligence, while detaining five of its local staff, and questioned employees at the Shanghai branch of American consultancy firm Bain.
     
            The broad scope of threats on the MSS’ radar is closely linked to Xi’s “comprehensive national security concept,” an overarching framework that includes more than 20 components to state security. It covers everything from politics, economy, defense, culture and ecology to cyberspace, big data and artificial intelligence, and extends from the deep sea and the polar regions to space.
     
            China has also broadened its already sweeping counterespionage law, casting a wider net over what the state deems as potential acts of spying.

            It now encompasses “a much broader range of activities, including what some in the foreign business community perceive as ordinary, everyday business behaviors,” said Guo at Guilford College. “This expansion also extends to the state’s authority to investigate and seize electronic devices, computers, and digital assets, raising heightened concerns about cybersecurity.”
     
            China’s heightened focus on national security stems not only from what it sees as a deteriorating international environment – especially its great-power rivalry with the US, but also concerns about the slowing Chinese economy. The property crisis and unpaid salaries have already sparked sporadic protests, and a worsening economic downturn could risk triggering further domestic unrest.
     
            Through the emphasis on national security, Guo said, Xi strategically redirects part of the criticism and blame for his policy failures onto external forces.
     
            The MSS’ propaganda and education campaigns – as well as its generous cash rewards for national security tip-offs – have spurred enthusiasm online for catching foreign spies.
     
            On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, influencers have rushed to produce short videos teaching their followers how to identify spies. In the comment sections, users shared their own experiences of reporting or encountering a suspected spy.
     
            On Xiaohongshu, China’s Instagram-like platform, a young woman caused a stir last year after she called the MSS’ hotline to report her boyfriend as a suspected spy. The blogger had been encouraged to do so by commentators after she said in an earlier post that her boyfriend could not remember the exact lyrics and tunes of China’s national anthem. “Ladies, is it normal if your boyfriend can’t sing the national anthem?” she asked in the post.
     
            Greitens noted that past examples from other countries have shown over-encouraging or incentivizing citizens to report on potential security threats can backfire.
     
            “The tendency is to over-report,” Greitens said. “What happens then is you can actually get lots of false positives in a system that can end up having a really corrosive long-term effect … the potential effects for Chinese citizens and foreign businesses could really start to accumulate quickly.”
     
            The relentless warnings from the MSS and its expanding powers have already raised alarms in the international business community, at a time when the Chinese government is trying to woo foreign investment to help revitalize a slowing economy.
     
            Last month, a day after Xi hosted a group of American executives in Beijing and less than a week after the annual China Development Forum attended by about 100 global CEOs, the MSS released a dramatic video warning the public to stay vigilant against foreign consultancy firms working as a cover for foreign intelligence services.
     
            The six-minute “micro movie,” which the agency says is based on real events, shows a consultancy working on behalf of an unidentified foreign spy agency to steal commercial secrets from a Chinese company seeking to go public abroad – and gleaning sensitive information about government industrial subsidies and the Chinese air force.
     
            Experts say such videos risk undermining Beijing’s central message that China is trying to lower barriers for foreign business and investment.
     
            “This is indicative of the conflicting messages coming from the top, as well as an unreasonable overemphasis on national security issues that is driving foreign investors away,” said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based partner at American law firm Perkins Coie LLP.
     
            “The ambiguity of the laws and lack of judicial oversight to prevent the security agencies from overreaching, creates much uncertainty for foreign companies.”

China’s spy-hunting campaign has a new target: ‘Illegal’ weather stations
 
            Following China’s crackdown on the consulting industry, most foreign consultancies have adjusted to the new environment, with some moving potentially controversial due-diligence or fact-finding work outside of mainland China, Zimmerman said.
     
            “Some that remain in China are getting called in for ‘tea,’” he added, referring to a euphemism for police questioning. “Not because they are under investigation, but to have a chilling effect and as a reminder that they, too are being watched by the security agencies.”
     
            Since starting his unprecedented third term in power in late 2022, Xi has repeatedly urged officials to balance development and security, calling security “the foundation of development.” But the highly visible warnings and raids by the MSS have fueled concerns among foreign businesses that, should the two appear to conflict, security will take precedence.
     
            The MSS is “driven more by politics than reality or good common sense,” Zimmerman said. “But this is China with Xi Jinping characteristics.”

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to China in the coming week as the Biden administration tries to ensure that the US-China relationship stays the course, even as the US expresses strong concerns about China’s support for Russia.
     
            This is Blinken’s second trip to the country as top US diplomat. He visited last year in an effort to “stabilize” relations following a period of immense tension between Washington and Beijing after an American fighter plane shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon that was detected over sensitive US military sites.
     
            President Joe Biden spoke on the phone with Xi earlier this month, marking the first conversation between the leaders since their historic in-person summit in November.
     
            “We are in a different place than we were a year ago when the bilateral relationship was at a historic low point,” a senior State Department official said.
     
            Blinken will meet with senior Chinese officials in both Shanghai and Beijing during his April 24-26 visit, the official said.
     
            The official said Blinken has “three primary objectives for his trip to China.”
     
            “First, making progress on key issues; second, clearly and directly communicating concerns on bilateral regional and global issues; and third, responsibly managing competition,” the official said.
     
            Blinken plans to “reiterate our deep concerns regarding the PRC’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base,” as well as its human rights abuses and “unfair economic and trade practices,” the official said.
     
            Blinken will also discuss the situation in the Middle East. The US has repeatedly called on China both publicly and privately to press Iran to exercise restraint as tensions simmer between it and Israel.
     
            “And of course, the secretary will discuss challenges in the Indo-Pacific, including PRC provocations in the South China Sea,” as well as North Korea’s “threatening rhetoric and reckless actions,” the official said. Blinken, he continued, “will also reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”
     
            During Blinken’s trip to China last June, he met in Beijing with top officials, including President Xi Jinping. US officials framed the trip as an effort to resume normal channels of communication with China in an effort to avoid conflict between two of the globe’s great powers.
     
            Blinken also met with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in July for what was described by the US as “candid and constructive” conversation.
     
            The call came amid heavy global turbulence — the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, were topics of discussion.
     
            The two also spoke about issues that have strained the Washington-Beijing relationship, including Taiwan, China’s recent provocations in the South China Sea and Beijing’s human rights abuses.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/china-luxury-watches/index.html,"China’s growing love of luxury watches remains strong, despite economic headwinds","Asian - and particularly Chinese - watch enthusiasts attended this year’s Watches and Wonders fair in large numbers, eager to be inspired by the best new designs.","Apr 19, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,CNN,China,"
            When the luxury Watches and Wonders fair closed its doors in Geneva earlier this week, it had hosted an estimated 49,000 luxury watch enthusiasts and collectors from around the world, all eager to be inspired by the best new designs and complications.
     
            According to a report by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FHS), mainland China and Hong Kong combined spent over 5 billion Swiss francs (5.49 billion) on watches in 2023, meaning luxury consumers in greater China are the biggest clients when it comes to the 26.7 billion franc (29.3 billion) watch exports business.
     
            But one region’s visitors stood out among the crowd — 40% of this year’s attendees hailed from Asia according to the event’s CEO Matthieu Humair, with a significant portion coming from China.
     
            It’s not surprising. Despite economic challenges looming large — including prolonged downturns in both the housing and stock market — China’s fascination with luxury watches remains undiminished.
     
            In fact, luxury watches are seen by many affluent Chinese as a compelling alternative investment avenue during times of financial uncertainty, when diversifying away from “traditional” investment﻿s such as real estate or stocks is seen as prudent.
     
            Certainly at this year’s fair, well-dressed, well-accessorized Chinese customers appeared unfazed by economic uncertainties. Mostly invited by brands, these high-spending VIP guests often pay millions for timepieces or jewelry, either at home in China or during overseas travels.
     
            Accordingly, Chinese brand ambassadors were also front and center at this year’s fair, with appearances by actors such as Jackson Yee at Jaeger Le-Coultre, Zhu Yilong at Chopard and Wang Yang at IWC. Other personalities including actor and singer Xiao Zhan conducted livestream sessions that enthusiasts could tune into.
     
            David Sadigh is CEO of Digital Luxury Group, a digital marketing agency in Europe and China whose clients include Patek Philippe and Van Cleef & Arpels. After more than 20 years working in the region, he believes China’s economic slowdown is just a temporary phase.

            “The higher-end price point brands are not concerned (by the downturn),” Sadigh told CNN during an interview at the fair in Geneva. “The situation may be slightly (more) challenging for mid-level luxury brands (whose clients’ disposable incomes are potentially more at the whim of market forces). But I’m confident that in the long run, China will be the biggest market for luxury watches.”
     
            Many executives of the 54 watchmaking brands that CNN spoke to at Watches and Wonders echoed this sentiment, expressing confidence in China’s ongoing passion for luxury timepieces and underscoring the resilience of this market segment amid the broader economic headwinds.
     
            Sales at Hublot, a prominent luxury watch brand in the LVMH stable, have this year rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, although growth rates have slowed compared to the peak of post-pandemic “revenge spending” (a phenomenon whereby customers rush to spend more than they usually would on something after being deprived of the ability to do so) in 2022. Despite commanding price tags sometimes into the millions of yuan, the brand continues to attract discerning consumers, with US and China as its biggest clients.
     
            “It’s understandable that people wait and see how to spend their money when the market is down,” said Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe. “For the Chinese consumers, once they consume, they will come back, because they appreciate luxury watches from the bottom of their heart.”
     
            Indeed, despite being a relatively new market for watchmakers, wealthy Chinese customers are already regarded as discerning clients alongside buyers from more mature markets like Europe and the US, who have long appreciated the artistry, elegance, and craftsmanship in haute horology.
     
            “We’ve seen in Asia — China in particular — average consumers are younger, around 35 (and) have an eye for unusual designs,” said Guadalupe.
     
            Carson Chan, a timepiece expert whose previous titles include General Manager of Richard Mille Asia, Bonhams’ Head of Watches and Chief Advisor of Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie (FHH), is also a collector. “In Asia, where collecting large items like cars can be challenging, watches offer a compact alternative for collectors,” Chan told CNN in an email interview from his home in Hong Kong. “The strong learning culture and understanding of mechanisms in Asia further support a sophisticated market, evidenced by the rise of independent brands across the region,” he added.

            Raphael Young, who also lives in Hong Kong and works in financial services in the IT industry, has just returned from the fair in Geneva. “As a watch collector, the five main criteria I look deeply into (are) value, craftsmanship, history, innovation and the people behind the timepieces and the brand,” he told CNN via a phone interview and added; “There is a lot of learning, researching, meetings and almost scholarly pursuits involved in cultivating my collecting hobby.”
     
            A. Lange & Söhne, a smaller independent watchmaker producing just 5,000 pieces globally, maintains a distinctive niche in the market. The brand’s CEO Wilhelm Schmid also remained unperturbed by China’s economic conditions.
     
            “A. Lange’s customers are real collectors; it’s very niche. Though our price is not low, there are groups of clients whose finances are not affected by the market fluctuations, who just appreciate the best timepieces,” he told CNN in an interview at the event. The house’s new Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon Honeygold Lumen, for example, integrates a flyback chronograph, a jumping minute counter, perpetual calendar with outsized date and a tourbillon with a stop-seconds mechanism.
     
            Some watchmakers appear to be courting Chinese buyers through unique design flourishes and Chan has observed that smaller case sizes are trending.
     
            Eleven years in the making, Vacheron Constantin’s record breaking one-piece-only giant pocket watch The Berkley has been designed to celebrate cultural fusion by combining traditional Chinese lunar calendar functions with Western horological complexities — for example a perpetual calendar, minute repeater, and tourbillon.
     
            “The Berkley features the first Chinese perpetual calendar which, given the particularities of the complex and irregular cycle… is a feat of horological genius,” said Young. “China has the longest continuous history of any country in the world (with) 3,500 years of written history, and it is only now we have a mechanical timepiece for the Chinese perpetual calendar. As a Chinese, I would find it useful and would be very interested in having such a complication.”
     
            Meanwhile, renowned Swiss watchmaker Roger Dubuis created another novelty in celebration of the new Year of the Dragon, on display in Geneva earlier this week. Limited to eight pieces, it is expected to appeal to Chinese collectors and enthusiasts.
     
            Among some of the most popular luxury fashion brands in China — which also include Dior, Louis Vuitton and Gucci — Chanel and Hermes have joined the traditional watchmakers at the fair, expanding beyond fashion watches into the universe of high watchmaking.
     
            Hermès unveiled the Arceau Duc Attelé watch, featuring a sapphire dome top and new minute repeater; and Chanel debuted a 55-piece limited edition Mademoiselle J12 Couture watch featuring a dial adorned with the silhouette of Mademoiselle Chanel in a black and white suit, finished with 46 baguette-cut diamonds.
     
            Unlike volatile financial markets, watches offer tangible value combined with emotional attachment. Collectors appreciate the craftsmanship, rarity, and heritage associated with luxury timepieces, which can hold or increase in value over time.
     
            “In a world where everything is so connected, there’s nothing more beautiful than a wristwatch powered by mechanical movement. It’s timeless, a piece of art, something to pass down to generations.” explained Humair. “We’re very excited to see younger generations in Asia, especially China, show a lot of interest in watchmaking.”

            Apple has removed WhatsApp and Threads from its app store in China, following an order from the country’s internet watchdog which cited national security concerns.
     
            “We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,” an Apple spokesperson told CNN on Friday. “The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns. These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.”
     
            The apps, both owned by Meta (META), were already blocked in China and not widely used. They could be accessed in the country only by using virtual private networks (VPNs) that can encrypt internet traffic and disguise the user’s online identity.
     
            The removal of the apps by Apple (AAPL) represents a “further distancing between already separated tech universes” in the country and beyond, said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory BDA China.
     
            “It will cause inconvenience to consumers and businesses (in China) who deal with family, friends or customers overseas. Even if they use VPNs to access their existing WhatsApp apps, these over time will become obsolete and require updating,” he said.
     
            Other popular Western social media apps including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram and Messenger are still available on Apple’s China app store, according to a check by CNN.
     
            The tech giant’s announcement comes against a backdrop of plunging iPhone sales in the world’s second largest economy. Its smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC.
     
            The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have hurt Apple over the past several months.
     
            The resurgence of Huawei and other Chinese brands, including Xiaomi and OPPO/OnePlus, will likely continue, according to IDC. Chinese consumers who once would have considered Apple are now turning to the country’s national brands.
     
            Besides being a key production center, China remains an important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the United States. The company continues to offer discounts in the country to help boost sales.
     
            Its CEO Tim Cook visited Shanghai just last month to open the second biggest Apple store in the world.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/climate/china-sinking-cities/index.html,"270 million people are living on sinking land in China’s major cities, new study finds","Nearly half of China’s urban areas comprising 29% of the country’s population are sinking faster than 3 millimeters per year, according to a new study.","Apr 18, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Rachel Ramirez,China,"
Land is sinking underneath millions of peoples’ feet in China’s major cities due to human activities, putting the country’s coastal areas more at risk of flooding and rising sea levels, new research shows.
     
            Nearly half of China’s urban areas comprising 29% of the country’s population are sinking faster than 3 millimeters (about 0.12 inches) per year, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science. That’s 270 million people living on sinking land.
     
            Meanwhile, 67 million people are living on land that is subsiding faster than 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) each year.
     
            China’s rampant groundwater extraction is one of the primary factors for subsidence, researchers said. Cities have been pumping water from underground aquifers faster than it can be replenished, a situation exacerbated by climate change-fueled drought. Excessive pumping lowers the water table and causes the overlying land to sink.
     
            The land is also sinking due to the growing weight of cities themselves. Soil can compact, naturally from the weight of sediments accumulating over time and from heavy buildings pressing down on the ground, causing the land to steadily sink.

            Land subsidence isn’t just a problem in China. In the US, dozens of coastal cities, including New York City, are sinking. In the Netherlands, 25% of its lands have sunk lower than sea levels. And in Mexico City, likely the world’s fastest subsiding city, land is sinking at the speed of up to 50 centimeters, or nearly 20 inches, a year.
     
            The impact of sinking is typically worse along the coasts, where the sea level is rising at the same time. This combination exposes more land, people and property to destructive flooding.
     
            The study suggests roughly a quarter of China’s coasts will be lower than sea level because of subsidence and projected sea level rise, priming the area for colossal damage and putting lives at risk. Tianjin, Shanghai and areas around Guangzhou are significantly exposed to both issues, the study found.
     
            But some coastal areas in China have already built physical protection from the growing risk of inundation, and the study does not take those protections into account. In Shanghai, for example, Shengli Tao, co-author of the study and professor at Peking University, said the city has built “impressive” dike systems that are meters tall.
     
            “Such massive coastal dike systems will largely reduce the risk of being inundated even given both land subsidence and sea level rise,” Tao told CNN. “I am not aware of other countries that have built such massive dike systems.”
     
            Thursday’s study is “scientifically robust” and did “a fine job” of highlighting that subsidence is not just a “coastal problem,” said Leonard Ohenhen, a doctoral researcher at Virginia Tech who recently published a study on land subsidence in the US.
     
            “Most urban cities experience land subsidence, but we focus our attention on coastal cities because of sea level rise,” Ohenhen, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. “However most urban cities experience land subsidence at rates comparable or even greater than subsidence in coastal cities.”

            Tao said the Chinese government is addressing the sinking in a few ways, including implementing strict laws to control groundwater pumping in the last few years. Shanghai and surrounding areas have been limiting groundwater withdrawals, which has slowed the region’s rate of subsidence. Decades ago, Shanghai’s subsidence was a significant issue, Tao said.
     
            China has also been pumping water from the Yangtze River in southern China to northern China – including to Beijing – which has suffered from water shortages. The project prevents the need for over-pumping groundwater and has stopped land subsidence in Beijing, the study found.
     
            “I believe China’s government efforts will address the issue of land subsidence,” Tao said. “But I would suggest to keep controlling groundwater withdrawals for major cities and constantly maintain dike systems in coastal lands.”

            Apple is planning to buy more components from Vietnam, underscoring a trend among global tech firms to look beyond China to secure their supply chains, cut costs and open up new markets.
     
            CEO Tim Cook made the pledge in a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi Tuesday, according to a statement by Vietnam’s government.
     
            Apple (AAPL) has already spent almost $16 billion through its supply chain in the country since 2019, the government quoted Cook as saying. And the company has created more than 200,000 jobs in Vietnam, it added.
     
            According to the statement, Cook said Apple “stands ready … to enhance cooperation and investment activities” in the Southeast Asian country.

How booming Vietnam offers the US an alternative to China
 
            His visit highlights Vietnam’s growing importance to global companies looking for alternatives to China as trade tensions between Beijing and the West have escalated in recent years.
     
            Vietnam has been a “major beneficiary” of moves by multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing hubs — a strategy known as “China plus one” — says Thuy Anh Nguyen, a strategist at Dragon Capital, a local fund management firm that invests solely in Vietnamese companies.
     
            Nguyen, whose firm manages $6 billion in assets, told CNN that labor costs in Vietnam’s manufacturing sector are about half those in neighboring China.
     
            That has helped Vietnam go from producing mostly “low-value products” like textiles to more tech products like iPhones and iPads, she said. “Those are higher-value items. That’s how we move up the value chain.”
     
            Vietnam pulled in more than $4.29 billion in foreign direct investment during the first two months of the year, up almost 39% from the same period in 2023, according to the country’s Ministry of Planning and Investment. Most of the new investment went into the processing and manufacturing sector.
     
            In recent years, fast-growing Asian economies like Vietnam and India have emerged as alternative locations for manufacturers as ties between Beijing and the West have frayed.
     
            Vietnam is “the perfect landing spot for tech companies to diversify outside China,” according to Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, who pointed to the high number of trained engineers in the country as one factor.
 
            “We’re not just talking about (manufacturing of) low-cost electronics,” he told CNN. “We’re talking higher up the value chain… That was not even on the radar (of foreign companies) two years ago.”
     
            Once enemies in war, the United States and Vietnam have grown increasingly close — the value of US imports of Vietnamese goods s﻿oared more than 360% in the decade to end-2023 to top $144 billion, according to US government data.
     
            In September, the two countries formally upgraded their diplomatic ties to a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” a symbolic yet highly important move that positions Vietnam as a destination for more US investment, including for critical technologies like semiconductor chips.
     
            Intel (INTC) has also taken note of Vietnam’s rise. In 2021, the company committed $1.5 billion to a sprawling campus just outside Ho Chi Minh City, which it says will be its largest single assembly and test facility in the world.
     
            At the same time, relations between the United States and China have deteriorated. A trade war between the two countries, which began in 2018 when Washington slapped tariffs on many Chinese imports, ratcheted up last year as both sides introduced tit-for-tat chipmaking export controls.
     
            During the pandemic, meanwhile, China’s strict zero-Covid policy scrambled global supply chains, demonstrating the risks of concentrating production in a single location.
     
            Notably, the world’s biggest iPhone factory, located in central China and owned by Taiwanese manufacturing firm Foxconn, was forced to temporarily shut down in 2022 after workers revolted over fears of the spread of coronavirus.
     
            Vietnam has another advantage, says Nguyen: A booming, educated, and youthful population. That’s a big draw for foreign tech companies looking to hire workers for their factories, and find consumers for their products.
     
            “Vietnam has a population of 100 million people. If it was in Europe, it would be the biggest country,” she said, also noting that smartphone adoption in Vietnam was rapidly increasing.
     
            The International Monetary Fund expects Vietnam’s economy to growth 5.8% this year, much faster than the predicted global average of 3.2%. For 2025, the fund forecasts growth of 6.5% in Vietnam. That’s not far off India’s pace of expansion.
     
            Still, Vietnam represents a far smaller market than India, which has also been wooing large foreign companies, including Tesla (TSLA), to set up factories in the country.
     
            For now, Vietnam’s attractiveness to foreign firms is “more around supply than demand,” says Ives at Wedbush Securities, while, for India, it encompasses both.

            High in the Himalayas, the people of a remote northern Indian territory fear their way of life is under threat from the changing climate, looming development – and border tensions with China.
     
            At stake, they believe, is the future of Ladakh, one of the world’s highest elevation regions, where indigenous tribes maintain nomadic traditions on sprawling plains hemmed in by mountains punctuated by Buddhist monasteries.
     
            For years, Lopzang Dadul herded his yaks, sheep and goats across the vast, vertiginous landscape near India’s contested border with China, following the seasons to find grazing land.
     
            But now, Dadul says, shepherds are being barred by the Indian military from lands that for generations sustained Ladakh’s nomadic way of life – a situation he and others say has worsened following a deadly 2020 border clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers.
     
            “In India, the army is not letting us go to places which they call no-man’s land … civilians are not allowed to go there anymore,” says Dadul, 33, a father of two from the village of Phobrang.
     
            “If we do not get enough land we will have to sell our livestock … and look for another option.”
     
            Ladakh’s herders inhabit what is now a highly strategically sensitive area, where India’s contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) boundary with China has for decades been a source of friction between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.
     
            “A lot of these grazing lands are in contested areas between India and China, and (after the 2020 clash) these grazing lands have now been denied to the locals, because they have been brought as part of buffer zones between India and China,” according to Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.
     
            Both India and China maintain a significant military presence along their de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has never been clearly defined and has remained a source of friction since a 1962 Sino-Indian border war.
     
            Four years ago, border tensions broke out into the open when a clash in Ladakh-Aksai Chin brought the first known fatalities in conflict between the two countries in more than four decades – with at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed.
     
            The violence was followed by a process of disengagement, the creation of buffer zones and ongoing border talks – but the situation remains tense and neither India nor China have publicly specified where the zones are, making for a murky reality on the ground.
     
            For that reason, the location of some of those zones may “not be clear to the local people,” said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi think tank Observer Research Foundation.
     
            The movement of herders is seen as sensitive because both countries have in the past used their presence in an area to assert military control over it, said Singh.
     
            “First graziers go, then you pitch up tents, and then your soldiers reach and then you say ‘this is our area,’” he said, noting why India is blocking them from entering these zones.
     
            Konchok Stanzin, 37, a councilor in Ladakh’s Chushul constituency, which encompasses four border villages, says such restrictions have impacted herders’ access to land.
     
            “Rezeng La, Mukhpari, Black Top, Helmet Top and Gurung Hill. All these areas are winter grazing areas of Chushul village. Now people find it very difficult to go there. These areas are now no-man’s land,” said Stanzin, who has been raising awareness about these issues since 2020.
     
            But those interviewed by CNN also point to what they say is the impact of Chinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.
     
            “We know the reality, we know the ground situation. If the (Indian) government says we have not lost an inch of land, then whatever we have lost is already lost,” said Stanzin.

            Dadul in Phobrang said the “Chinese are coming toward us constantly. They have been crossing the line and coming in,” he said. “China is capturing the land, the Indian government is saying nothing is lost, the (Indian) Army is not letting us go there.”
     
            CNN was unable to independently confirm the status of the restricted land described in this report, nor claims of Chinese encroachment or loss of Indian territorial control after the 2020 clash.
     
            In a statement, India’s Ministry of Defense told CNN: “No Indian territory has been lost during the standoff. Negotiations are currently underway for disengagement at the remaining friction points.”
     
            On the buffer zones, the ministry said: “all disengagements achieved till date have been based on the principle of Mutual and Equal Security. Currently, a mutually agreed moratorium exists on military activities from both sides in areas where disengagement has been affected, to maintain peace and tranquility.”
     
            The “number of Indian graziers and livestock in traditional grazing areas has seen a sharp rise” after the events of 2020, the ministry’s statement added. “There has thus been no adverse impact on the livelihood of locals in the area.”
     
            China’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
     
            Mounting concern over threats to the way of life in Ladakh – from lost grazing lands to climate change and industrialization – have driven thousands from across the region to its joint capital city of Leh in recent weeks to demand greater rights ahead of India’s general election, which begins Friday.
     
            There, some 3,500 meters (11,550 feet) above sea level, residents are calling for Indian statehood for Ladakh to ensure political representation, as well as inclusion in the national constitution’s Sixth Schedule, which grants special rights to tribal areas. Organizers say at least 10,000 people turned out during a single day in Leh last month to support the start of an ongoing, weekslong hunger strike.
     
            Ladakh lost special controls over its land in 2019, following a controversial move by the Indian central government that stripped the former state of Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and broke off Ladakh, which had been a part of it, into a separate territory.
     
            The change placed the region under the direct control of India’s central government, which critics say has pared back national environmental protections and backed ecologically harmful infrastructure development pushes in other sensitive parts of the country in recent years.
     
            China doesn’t recognize what its Foreign Ministry has called the “so-called union territory of Ladakh,” saying the “western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China.” In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which New Delhi has fraught relations.
     
            Now many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.
     
            “Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) … make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,” said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.
     
            Speaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, “we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.”
     
            He pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.
     
            The activism has faced pressure from local authorities.
     
            Earlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an “apprehension of breach of peace.”
     
            CNN has reached out to Leh’s district magistrate and local police for comment.
     
            Some, like the Ladakh president of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected. He also suggested the border dispute is a factor in why other demands won’t be met.
     
            “We are with the border with China and Pakistan. How can a sensitive (place) like Ladakh just be turned into a state immediately?” the local party leader, Phunchok Stanzin, told CNN.
     
            The nomadic traditions of shepherd communities living off the land and selling goats’ wool to be spun into luxurious Pashmina had already been diminishing in Ladakh in recent decades.
     
            A tourism boom and the impacts of climate change – as receding glaciers and other impacts drive flash floods, drought and reduced snowfall – are among factors shifting how some families make their livings.
     
            Namgail Phonchok, 51, whose village lies south of the piercing blue waters of Pangong Lake that stretches from India into China, fears his children won’t be able to continue their way of life – including due to access restrictions on grazing lands.
     
            “When they won’t let us graze, then we will sell our animals. We do not know what other job to get, and our own work will also go, then what will we do?” he said, adding that “if big industries come here then the environment will get ruined completely.”
     
            Between longer-term changes and new restrictions on grazing lands, “our nomadic way of life is going away,” Phonchok said.
     
            Dadul, in Phobrang, has seen those changes too.
     
            He says 60 of the 113 households in his village used to be nomadic; now only 10 are maintaining the tradition due to those factors and lost grazing lands.
     
            “Nomadic way of life is a very rare thing in India. In one home you have yaks, sheep, goats, horses and other livestock …  yaks are meant for transportation and milk, cheese and butter, and the goats give Pashmina. This is the actual eco-friendly and sustainable way of life,” he said.
     
            “When the army steps back from the real border, this effect spills over to the village … and the movement of the nomadic tribes is restricted,” he added.
     
            New Delhi has denied that its border tensions with China are impacting the lives of the shepherds there.
     
            And Prime Minister Narendra Modi – India’s Hindu nationalist leader, who is widely expected to win a rare third term in the upcoming election – has tread cautiously around the border issue, claiming in the wake of the June 2020 border clash that “no one has intruded” into Indian territory.
     
            Modi’s comments appeared to contradict his own foreign minister, who said the violence began after “the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC.” Beijing at the time said, “none of the responsibility lies with China,” blaming Indian troops for “starting provocations” and crossing the de facto border.
     
            New Delhi says two sites remain contested along the Ladakh border after disengagement at other contested zones following the 2020 clash. Observers believe Chinese forces are blocking Indian patrols in those contested areas where they previously had access.
     
            At the points where there has been disengagement, the establishment of buffer zones means “both sides have pulled back by mutual agreement and neither side patrols there,” as opposed to earlier, when troops could patrol up to their claim, according to Joshi in New Delhi.
     
            New Delhi’s official response – and the lack of transparency over buffer zones – has fueled domestic debate about India’s position on the border.
     
            A report from a Ladakh police superintendent released in 2023 further stoked concerns – detailing how Indian forces lost their presence in 26 of 65 patrol points over an unspecified period. Reduced patrolling led to an ultimate loss of control over such areas, where China grabs land “inch-by-inch,” the report said.
     
            The report also accused China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of having “taken advantage” of the buffer areas established in the de-escalation talks by objecting to Indian forces’ movement in the buffer zone and asking for further pushback.
     
            It noted: “Much restrictions on the movement of civilians and grazers near the forward areas on the Indian side, indicating their ‘play safe’ strategy that they do not want to annoy the PLA by giving them the chance to raise objections on the areas being claimed as disputed.”
     
            A copy was posted online by Indian magazine The Caravan alongside a report from Singh, from the Centre for Policy Research.
     
            Singh, who is also a lecturer at Yale University, suggested the lack of clarity on the border situation may stem from Modi’s concerns over Chinese military superiority – and tarnishing his government’s image.
     
            If Modi’s strongly nationalist government were to acknowledge loss of territorial control, “it would be very difficult for him to then not take some aggressive action to regain that lost territory,” he said.
     
            “Then the risk of escalation would be very high and, in that escalation, I think Mr. Modi’s government fears that they could be humiliated – that they could lose to China.”
     
            But some from Ladakh argue that the sensitivity of the region, both environmentally and strategically, is the very reason to allow the local people more control over the land – including access around the border.
     
            “The shepherd is going to the mountain and protecting it every day,” said Dadul, the shepherd from Phobrang.
     
            “If the real protectors are brought to the borders and allowed to stay there, then what is left will be protected.”

            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke on Tuesday morning with China’s Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun, marking both Austin’s first call with Dong and his first at-length conversation with his Chinese counterpart since November 2022.
     
            During their teleconference call, Austin and Dong “discussed U.S.-PRC defense relations and regional and global security issues,” a news release said Tuesday morning.
     
            “Secretary Austin underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea,” the release said. “He also discussed Russia’s unprovoked war against Ukraine and expressed concerns about recent provocations from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Secretary also reiterated that the United States remains committed to our longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three U.S.-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances, and he reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Strait.”
     
            Dong, a former naval commander, was appointed as China’s defense minister in December last year. A senior defense official on Monday declined to say for how long the call between the two had been in planning, but said they typically “take some time to schedule and prepare for on both sides.”
     
            The conversation is a result of the meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, the official said, which followed months of strained silence between the two countries. In 2023, China rejected a US proposal for Austin to meet with his then-counterpart Li Shangfu at the Shangri-La Dialogue Security Forum in Singapore.
     
            It also comes less than two weeks after US and Chinese military representatives met in-person in Honolulu for the first meeting of its kind in years after cancellations by China.
     
            “I think that what we’ve seen is the PRC committed to reestablishing or reopening these lines of communication … The call between the Secretary and the Minister is another step in that set of engagements, an important one, but certainly should not be the last one,” the official said. “I think we’ll have more coming throughout this year.”
     
            While US officials said last fall that there had been an increase in unsafe behavior by Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the Pacific, the senior defense official on Monday said they have not seen that behavior since November.
     
            “We have, however, seen behavior that risks escalation, very coercive behavior towards the Philippines and the maritime domain, particularly around Second Thomas Shoal,” the official said.
     
            In his conversation with Dong on Tuesday, the release said Austin “reiterated that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate – safely and responsibly – wherever international law allows.”

            Chinese runner He Jie’s victory Sunday in the Beijing Half Marathon is facing a probe after his win was called into question by Chinese internet users because a trio of African runners appeared to deliberately slow down to let him win.
     
            A video clip of the finish to the race shows Kenya’s Willy Mnangat turn toward He and gesture him to move ahead as the four men run neck and neck just meters from the finish line.
     
            Former 5km world record-holder Robert Keter, also of Kenya, then appears to wave at He to overtake the pack while signaling for his compatriot and Ethiopia’s Dejene Hailu to hang back.
     
            The Chinese runner crossed the finish line in 1:03:44 to claim the $5,500 first prize, with the African trio just one second behind in joint-second place.
     
            The video clip shows the African runners applauding He’s win and patting him on the back, though the Asian Games marathon champion appears less enthused despite winning his first ever competitive half marathon.
     
            He, 25, who has broken China’s marathon record twice in the past two years, told reporters after the race that he “was not in my best competitive state” — but he did not address the controversial finish.
     
            Some Chinese internet users called for an investigation into the race, while others demanded action from organizers.
     
            “The so-called ‘ways of the world’ should not taint the fairness of competition in sports. Fairness is always at the core of sporting spirit,” said one user on social platform Weibo.
     
            Another popular comment said: “I support an investigation, and fair play is vital,” with the user adding they hoped authorities “can give a clear explanation to maintain fairness of competition and respect athletes’ efforts.”
     
            In a statement Monday, race organizers the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau and Chinese Athletics Association said they attach “great importance” to the matter and were conducting an investigation.
     
            Chinese sports company Xtep, which sponsors both He and the Beijing Half Marathon, told state-run outlet The Paper the situation is “being investigated and verified by multiple parties.”
     
            “Further information will be communicated as soon as possible,” Xtep said in a statement to the outlet.
     
            World Athletics, the sport’s international governing body, said in a statement to CNN Tuesday that it was aware of the footage of the race circulating online and understood local authorities were investigating.
     
            “The integrity of our sport is the highest priority at World Athletics,” it said.
     
            Some observers agreed the finish to the race seemed unusual.
     
            “It’s just a bad look, however you slice it,” said sports analyst Mark Dreyer, author of “Sporting Superpower: An Insider’s View on China’s Quest to Be the Best.”
     
            “It’s one thing for four runners running right at the end to potentially hold hands or cross the line together in a show of sportsmanship. That’s not what we saw.
     
            “It’s not a sprint finish for anyone other than He Jie. It doesn’t take a genius or running expert to figure that out.”
     
            He, who hails from northwest China’s Ningxia region, is considered one of the country’s most promising long-distance runners. He is ranked 77th in the world in men’s marathon by World Athletics and is expected to lead the way for Asian runners in the upcoming Paris 2024 Summer Olympics.
     
            “He Jie is elite,” Dreyer said. “He doesn’t need charity like this.”

            China’s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, mainly thanks to robust growth in high-tech manufacturing.
     
            Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. That beat the estimate of 4.6% growth from a Reuters poll of economists. It also marked an acceleration from the 5.2% growth in the previous three months.
     
            “The Chinese economy got off to a good start in the first quarter … laying a good foundation for achieving the goals for the whole year,” said Sheng Laiyun, a spokesperson for the NBS, at a press conference in Beijing accompanying the data release.
     
            But he acknowledged that “the foundation for economic stability and improvement is not yet solid.”
     
            Industrial production jumped 6.1% in the first quarter from a year ago, boosted by strong growth in high-tech manufacturing.
     
            In particular, the production of 3D printing equipment, charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) and electronic components all surged about 40% compared to a year earlier.

China’s new factory data shows a bright start to the year
 
            Last month, an official survey showed China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) expanded for the first time in six months. The Caixin/S&P manufacturing PMI, a privately run survey, also hit its strongest reading in more than a year, as overseas demand picked up.
     
            China has set an annual growth target of around 5% for 2024, which many analysts considered ambitious, as consumer and business confidence remains weak and the real estate sector is mired in a prolonged downturn.
     
            The authorities have cut interest rates this year to boost bank lending and speed up central government spending to support infrastructure investment.
     
            “The economy appears within reach to meet the official target of ‘around 5%’ GDP growth in 2024,” Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist for HSBC, told CNN.
     
            Tuesday’s data showed that retail sales grew 4.7% in the January-to-March period, boosted by spending in sports and entertainment activities, cigarettes and alcohol, as well as catering services.
     
            Investment in fixed assets — such as factories, roads and power grids — increased 4.5% during the same period.
     
            But there are plenty of concerns still.
     
            “There’s a growing mismatch in China’s economy; manufacturers are doing the heavy lifting, while households sit on the sidelines,” said Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody’s Analytics.
     
            Much of the good news in manufacturing comes from China’s “new three” industries: EVs, solar panels and batteries.
     
            “Officials have spent big to support these strategic industries, and are reaping the rewards as production takes off and exports — particularly for EVs — surge amid a broader pullback in global demand,” Cruise said.
     
            But the strategy isn’t without risks.
     
            There is growing angst in the United States and European Union that China’s overcapacity in these areas is flooding global markets and hindering their domestic industries.
     
            Comments by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her visit to China last week highlight America’s willingness to intervene with tariffs, if it deems them necessary.
     
            “Were that to occur, China’s manufacturing bright spot would be dampened,” Cruise said.
     
            The property market is also a major drag.
     
            Property investment slumped 9.5% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to NBS data. New property sales slid 27.6% during the same period.
     
            Separately, new home prices in 70 cities fell 2% in March from a year earlier, which was faster than February’s 1.3% drop, according to Goldman Sachs’ calculation based on the NBS’ latest data release.
     
            “The property market’s woes are continuing,” Cruise said.
     
            The embattled property market is weighing on consumer spending, as 70% of Chinese household wealth is tied to real estate.
 
            Weak job prospects and economic uncertainty are also holding back household spending.
     
            In March, retail sales growth slowed to 3.1% from 5.5% in February.
     
            According to the NBS data, household confidence for employment and income is near “the historical bottom,” which dragged down retail sales in March because demand had been released during the Lunar New Year holidays that took place weeks earlier, said Chaoping Zhu, Shanghai-based global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.
     
            Confidence in the world’s second largest economy among foreign investors, who had helped power growth during China’s boom days, also remains weak.
     
            The growth in first-quarter investment came mainly from state-owned enterprises, which spent 7.8% more than a year ago. Investment by the private sector increased by just 0.5%.
     
            As for foreign companies, their investment in the country plunged by 10.4% in the first three months.
     
            Beijing has made reviving economic growth its top priority for this year and has renewed its efforts to woo foreign investors.
     
            On Tuesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Beijing and called on the two countries to boost trade and “deepen cooperation” on machine manufacturing, autos and artificial intelligence as complaints from the EU grow about the proliferation of Chinese products.
     
            A day before, Scholz said Germany welcomed imports of Chinese cars but warned against dumping, overproduction and intellectual property infringements, according to Reuters.
     
            Last month, Xi met with more than a dozen US CEOs and academics in Beijing and invited them to “continue to invest in China.” He expressed confidence that the country will maintain a healthy and sustainable growth in the coming months.
     
            China’s economy grew 5.2% in 2023. While this expansion marked a significant pick-up compared to 2022, when it grew by just 3% amid intense coronavirus lockdowns and disruption, it was still one of the country’s economic worst performances in over three decades.
     
            Foreign direct investment in China has slumped in recent months as a combination of slower growth, regulatory crackdowns, onerous national security legislation and questions about the country’s long-term prospects have shaken confidence in the world’s second biggest economy.
     
            “The strong first-quarter growth figure goes a long way in achieving China’s ‘around 5%’ target for the year. But medium-term growth prospects hinge on broadening the economy’s growth drivers,” Cruise said.
     
            “If the officials can’t convince households to loosen the purse strings, the economy risks having too many eggs in one basket.”

            China has voiced “deep concern” over escalating tensions in the Middle East after Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack on Israel, raising the prospect of a wider conflagration in a region where Beijing has pledged to play peacemaker and promote its own security vision.
     
            “(China) calls on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalation,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday, framing the latest tensions as “a spillover from the Gaza conflict” – which it said should be put to an end as soon as possible.
     
            “China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,” the ministry added.
     
            The Iranian strikes, which Tehran said were retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus on April 1 that it attributed to Israel, marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil.
     
            In a call with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated that Beijing “strongly condemns and firmly opposes” the April 1 attack, a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry said.
     
            Wang did not condemn Iran’s retaliation. China noted Iran’s statement that its action was limited and an “act of self-defense” and appreciated Tehran’s stress on “not targeting regional and neighboring countries,” Wang said, according to the readout.
     
            Separately, China’s special envoy on the Middle East, Zhai Jun, met Monday with Irit Ben-Abba Vitale, Israel’s ambassador to China, and reiterated Beijing’s call for an “immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities” in Gaza and “deep concern” about escalating regional tensions.

Restraint or retribution? Israel faces dilemma in its response to Iran’s attack
 
            The decision by Iran’s leaders to strike at Israel directly has pushed the shadow war between the two regional foes into the open. Israel is being urged by Western allies to de-escalate, as fears grow of an all-out regional war – a scenario Washington has sought to enlist Beijing’s help to avoid. The bulk of the weapons launched by Iran in the highly choreographed attack were intercepted by Israel and its allies.
     
            Following the Damascus strike, which Iran said killed seven people, including two top Iranian military commanders, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to Wang – and other counterparts in Turkey and Saudi Arabia – to “make clear that escalation is not in anyone’s interest, and that countries should urge Iran not to escalate,” according to a US State Department spokesperson.
     
            That was not the first time the US had asked China to influence Iran since the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas broke out last October.
     
            In the wake of Houthi rebels’ assaults on commercial shipping in the Red Sea late last year, American officials repeatedly tried to prod Beijing into pressuring Tehran – which is believed to train, fund and equip the Houthis – to rein in the attacks.
     
            The latest flare-up of tensions has again raised questions over how much leverage China wields over Iran – and whether Beijing is willing to turn its political capital into influence.
     
            “On paper, China has a great deal of potential leverage over Iran,” said William Figueroa, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
     
            China has been Iran’s biggest trading partner for the past decade and buys 90% of Iran’s oil exports, providing a lifeline to Tehran against US sanctions. Chinese companies also provide Iran with security and surveillance equipment.
     
            In practice, however, it is difficult for China to pull these levers to influence Iran’s behavior, Figueroa said.
     
            “Weaponizing these trade relations, especially in such a high-profile way, would undermine its greater regional strategy of developing close economic ties throughout the Global South,” he said.

            China has greatly expanded its economic and political footprint in the Middle East. In recent years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to “contribute Chinese wisdom to promoting peace and tranquility in the Middle East” as part of his Global Security Initiative to offer an alternative to the Western-led security order.
     
            Last year, Beijing brokered a historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two longtime regional rivals, but reining in Tehran in the ongoing conflict could prove a thornier task for China, analysts say.
     
            Relations between Beijing and Tehran are already strained by China’s “chronic underinvestment in Iran” despite repeated promises, and previous attempts to influence Iranian policy over the Houthi attacks, Figueroa said.
     
            “While happy to play a role in negotiations, the reality is they lack real coercive power in the region and remain primarily interested in trade and diplomatic initiatives. They are aware of this and not eager to overextend themselves the way they believe the US has done.”
     
            And while China is genuinely concerned about the risk a wider conflict poses to its investment and trade in the region – especially its energy deals, it believes the root cause lies in the conflict in Gaza.
     
            “Therefore, it sees the real solution not in China restraining Iran, but rather in the United States restraining Israel and bringing the conflict to a negotiated settlement that includes a two-state solution,” Figueroa said.
     
            China’s lack of condemnation for Iran’s weekend’s attack stands in contrast to the US and other Western allies, as well as Beijing’s own response following what Tehran says was an Israeli strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month.
     
            Israel did not claim responsibility for that airstrike. However, a military spokesperson told CNN that Israel believes the Iranian building hit in the attack is a “military building of Quds forces” and not a consulate.
     
            Beijing issued a strong condemnation following that airstrike in Damascus.
     
            “The security of diplomatic institutions must not be violated, and the sovereignty and independence of Syria must be respected,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular news conference the day after the attack.

            “Amid the ongoing turbulence in the Middle East, we oppose any act that would escalate the tensions.”
     
            Beijing relayed that message to Washington last week, when Wang stressed in his phone call with Blinken that “China strongly condemns the attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria,” according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
     
            Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China is reluctant to condemn Iran for its retaliatory strikes because it sees Tehran as a victim.
     
            “I think the Chinese are particularly sympathetic to Iran given their own experience of the US bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade. That’s why China does not condemn Iran,” Sun said.
     
            During a NATO air raid on the former Yugoslavia in 1999, pilots attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists.
     
            Bill Clinton, US President at the time, apologized to then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and called the bombing a “tragic accident” resulting from faulty intelligence. Beijing meanwhile denounced that strike as a “barbarian act,” with protests erupting outside US diplomatic compounds across China.
     
            “It’s unlikely, therefore, for China to apply pressure on Iran,” Sun said. “For China, had US applies enough pressure on Israel, neither the Israeli attack nor the Iranian retaliation would have taken place. To apply pressure on Iran, which is seen as the victim at the first place, is illogical.”
     
            The drastic escalation of tensions has drawn stern responses from other countries in Asia.
     
            Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he “strongly condemns” Iran’s attack, which “further aggravates the current situation in the Middle East,” and pledged to continue diplomatic efforts to “prevent the situation from worsening and to calm the situation down.”

            The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia also called for restraint.

            China is helping Russia ramp up its defense industrial base at such a large scale that Moscow is now undertaking its most ambitious expansion in military manufacturing since the Soviet era as it continues its war against Ukraine, according to senior Biden administration officials.
     
            The support China is providing includes significant quantities of machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and technology for cruise missiles, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, which Russia uses to make propellant for weapons, said the officials.
     
            Chinese and Russian entitles have also been working jointly to produce drones inside of Russia, one of the officials said.
     
            The support from China is having a significant impact on Russia’s ability to continue its assault on Ukraine, while Ukraine’s military has been plagued with equipment and weapon shortages. The challenge for Ukraine is exacerbated by Republicans in the US Congress continuing to block a vote on a new American military aid package to Kyiv.
     
            “One of the most game changing moves available to us at this time to support Ukraine is to persuade the PRC (People’s Republic of China) to stop helping Russia reconstitute its military industrial base. Russia would struggle to sustain its war effort without PRC inputs,” said a senior administration official, adding that Chinese “materials are filling critical gaps in Russia’s defense production cycle.”
     
            Just this week Gen. Chris Cavoli, the commander of US European Command, told lawmakers that Russia has been “quite successful” at reconstituting its military since it invaded Ukraine more than 2 years ago, and its capacity has largely “grown back” to what it was before the invasion. US officials are now making clear that China is largely responsible for that rapid build-up.
     
            As a demonstration of this deepening China-Russia partnership: in 2023, 90% of Russia’s micro-electronics imports came from China, which Russia has used to produce missiles, tanks, and aircraft, a second official said.
     
            And Russia’s rapidly expanding production of artillery rounds is due, in large part, to the nitrocellulose coming from China, officials said. This comes as Russia appears on track to produce nearly three times more artillery munitions than the US and Europe, CNN reported earlier this year.
     
            Beyond the defense hardware, China is helping Russia to improve its satellite and other space based capabilities for use in Ukraine, and providing imagery to Russia for its war on Ukraine, the officials said.
     
            Some of this information comes from downgraded US intelligence, officials said.
     
            The support from China is compensating for the significant setbacks that Russia’s defense industry experienced early in the Ukraine war due to US sanctions and export controls.
     
            President Joe Biden raised concerns about China’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month, following other officials repeatedly raising the concerns with their Chinese counterparts, officials said.
     
            Secretary of State Antony Blinken also raised the matter with US allies during his recent Europe trip, the officials said. The US has not seen any interruption to the ongoing Chinese support since that Biden-Xi phone call, though sometimes it takes time to see changes come to fruition.
     
            China continues to steer clear of providing Russia with lethal weaponry, which the US has warned against since the beginning of the Ukraine war, but in many cases the inputs can be just as impactful as lethal weaponry.
     
            US officials said it is imperative for the US and its allies to persuade China to stop this practice, though success will be hard to measure. Earlier this year Xi heralded a new year of growing coordination with Russia during a call with President Vladimir Putin.
     
            Earlier this month Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen delivered China a warning of “significant consequences” if Chinese companies provide support to Russia for the Ukraine war during her trip to the country.
     
            The Biden administration also issued an executive order targeting third country banks that facilitate support to the Russian defense industrial base and following that action the US has been touch with banks around the world to build up compliance systems to avoid inadvertently being caught up in this trade, which would result in US sanctions.

            The US aviation industry has asked the Biden administration to pause approval of additional flights to and from China, saying Beijing’s “existing harmful anti-competitive policies” hurt American airlines and workers.
     
            “The competitive disadvantage is harmful to the approximately 315,000 workers employed by US passenger airlines that serve China,” according to a letter published Thursday addressing Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
     
            The letter was signed by industry lobby group Airlines for America — whose members include American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL) and United (UAL) — and other unions representing aviation workers, including the Air Line Pilots Association.
     
            “If the growth of the Chinese aviation market is allowed to continue unchecked and without concern for equality of access in the market, flights will continue to be relinquished to Chinese carriers at the expense of US workers and businesses,” it added.
     
            In February, Washington said it will allow Chinese airlines to further increase their direct passenger flights to the United States, in an effort to gradually restore aviation services that had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
     
            Chinese carriers were given approval by US officials to make 50 weekly round trips to and from the United States, up from 35, from March 31.
     
            But the increased number is still only a fraction of the more than 150 weekly round trips allowed by each side before curbs were imposed in early 2020.
     
            In the letter, American carriers said China implemented strict limits to market access during the pandemic and imposed challenging rules affecting operations, customers and the treatment of US airline crew.
     
            The “anti-competitive disadvantage” with China worsened in 2022, the letter said, when the Asian country’s airlines continued to access Russian airspace, while US carriers stopped using it as a result of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February of that year.
     
            Having to avoid Russian airspace adds time and costs to flights.
     
            “These actions demonstrated the clear need for the US government to establish a policy that protects US aviation workers, industry and air travelers,” it said.
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday that increasing direct flights was the “consensus reached” when Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden met in San Francisco in November.
     
            “It [boosting flights] will help the two peoples strengthen exchanges and enhance mutual understanding,” the ministry added.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/11/politics/us-japan-philippines-trilateral-meeting/index.html,Biden says US defense commitments to Japan and Philippines remain ‘ironclad’ as he hosts key meeting amid China tensions,"The White House is very concerned by China’s actions in the South China Sea, a senior administration official said, as President Joe Biden prepares to draw two Asian allies closer at a historic meeting on Thursday.","Apr 12, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Samantha Waldenberg,China,"
            The United States’ commitments to the defense of Japan and the Philippines remain “ironclad,” President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the leaders of those countries amid their separate territorial disputes with China.
     
            The comments came as Biden hosted the first ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
     
            “When we stand as one, we’re able to forge a better future for all,” Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.
     
            Japan and the Philippines both have separate territorial disputes with China, in the former’s case the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and in the latter’s areas of the South China Sea.
     
            Philippines-China tensions have focused on Second Thomas Shoal, which sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s, the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.
     
            Meanwhile, China claims the shoal, which is in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, as its sovereign territory, as it does much of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international arbitration ruling. Recent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels.
     
            Referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, Biden on Thursday said “any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defense treaty.”
     
            The 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines – the oldest such US pact in the Asia-Pacific – stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.
     
            Thursday’s meeting marks the latest attempt by the administration to grapple with that sort of Chinese aggression, and a senior administration official said ahead of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China’s actions in the South China Sea.
     
            “What you’ll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,” one official said ahead of Thursday’s meeting.
     
            Marcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States “meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”
     
            The three countries, Marcos added, are “linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.”
     
            The meeting comes as the region is grappling with the uncertainty of China’s aggressive posture toward Taiwan and the South China Sea along with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its burgeoning relationship with Russia – concerns that have drawn regional allies closer to the US.
     
            Japan has been at the center of Biden’s alliance building in the Indo-Pacific as officials have seen a willing partner in Kishida, who has significantly shifted the country’s defense posture in recent years and provided ongoing support to Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kishida has committed to increasing defense spending by 2% of GDP by 2037 and acquired American Tomahawk missiles to increase its counterstrike capabilities.
     
Biden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.
     
            “We’re going to continue to support the Philippines military’s modernization goals,” Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations “not only share a strong partnership – we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.”
     
            A highlight of Thursday’s meeting were several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines amid those clashes.
     
            A senior administration official also said that on Thursday the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between Philippines’s Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that’s meant to send a clear message to Beijing.
     
            Biden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: “It means more jobs for people across the entire region,” he said. “It means more investment in sectors critical to our future - clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.”
     
            The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military’s capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the leadup to the G20.
     
            In the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and Philippines – along with Australia – conducted maritime military exercises near Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged “harassment” by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.
     
            The senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements in “Open Radio Access Network technology” and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.
     
            Officials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will be taking place “in the coming year.”

            The European Union has launched an investigation into China’s state support for its wind turbine companies, intensifying a push to protect Europe’s industry from a flood of cheap Chinese imports.
     
            Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, said Tuesday that the probe would look into the development of wind farms in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria.
     
            The move provides further evidence of tensions between China, the world’s biggest manufacturer, and its major trading partners resulting from the oversupply of Chinese goods in key industries around the world. The country’s global trade surplus in goods has soared in recent years and is now approaching $1 trillion.
     
            On Thursday, a Chinese commerce ministry official responded that Beijing “firmly opposes” the investigation. The probe not only “seriously damages” the confidence of Chinese enterprises operating in Europe, but also interferes with mutually beneficial industrial cooperation between the two sides, the official said in a statement.
     
            “It will also affect global efforts to address climate change and the process of green transformation.”
     
            Vestager’s announcement as part of a speech in Princeton, New Jersey, came just days after the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, opened a separate subsidies probe into Chinese companies bidding for a solar farm contract in Romania.
     
            The commission is making use of new powers under its Foreign Subsidies Regulation, aimed at addressing market distortions caused by subsidies from foreign governments and ensuring that EU companies are competing on a level playing field.
     
            “We saw the playbook for how China came to dominate the solar panel industry,” Vestager said, citing “massive subsidies for domestic suppliers.”

            “The result is that nowadays, less than 3% of the solar panels installed in the EU are produced in Europe,” she added, noting that China was deploying the same strategy across other areas of clean technology, including “exporting excess capacity to the rest of the world at low prices.”
     
            “We can’t afford to see what happened on solar panels happening again on electric vehicles, wind or essential chips,” Vestager said.
     
            In October, the European Commission launched an investigation into China’s subsidies for electric vehicle makers, which it suspects may be enabling these firms to keep prices super-low, creating unfair competition with European rivals.
     
            Beijing sees exports as a key measure to revive China’s slowing economy and is increasingly focusing on higher-value exports in industries that Europe and the United States see as strategically important as they seek to green their economies and reduce planet-heating pollution.

            China’s highest-level visit to North Korea in nearly five years is set to get underway Thursday, as Pyongyang seeks to strengthen relations with both Beijing and Moscow amid growing coordination between its neighbors and the United States.
     
            Zhao Leji, China’s third-highest ranked official, will lead a delegation for a “goodwill visit” to the country to kickstart a “friendship year” marking 75 years of diplomatic ties, Beijing announced Tuesday.
     
            The three-day visit, at North Korea’s invitation, shows the “great importance” China attaches to those relations, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. North Korea’s state media agency KCNA also announced the visit.
     
            It also affords a top Chinese official the opportunity to hear directly from North Korea’s intensely secretive and isolated government while on the ground, analysts say.
     
            Zhao is the highest-ranking Chinese visitor to the country since a state visit from Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2019. Zhao leads China’s rubber-stamp national legislature and is a member of its powerful seven-man Politburo Standing Committee.
     
            The trip comes as both countries are wary of what they see as an increasingly hostile region – in particular growing security coordination between the US and its allies Japan and South Korea, which in turn seek to counter aggression from Beijing and Pyongyang.

            The delegation will also arrive amid heightened global concern about North Korea, which has in recent months ramped up its bellicose rhetoric and continued its weapons testing. Pyongyang has also forged closer ties with Moscow, and begun supplying arms used in its war in Ukraine, the US and its allies say.
     
            Those geopolitical fault lines are underscored as the Chinese delegation’s visit coincides with a raft of Asia-focused diplomacy in Washington this week.
     
            US President Joe Biden is hosting a trilateral summit with the Philippines and Japan Thursday, a day after a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida where they pledged to advance coordination around countering challenges from China and North Korea.
     
            In an interview with CNN ahead of that meeting, Kishida referred to China and North Korea’s close ties with Russia and urged them to “maintain a free and open international order based on the rule of law.”
     
            As the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s No. 3 official below Xi and Premier Li Qiang, Zhao’s “goodwill” mission carries more weight than a visit from a government-level minister.
     
            The visit is not expected to usher in diplomatic developments but will be an opportunity for China to reinforce its own deep and complex ties with North Korea – and convey to the US and the region that it has leverage there.
     
            “(At a time) when the United States is trying to work more closely with Japan and South Korea, China wants to signal its own influence,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor at Hong Kong’s City University.
     As Donald Trump and President Joe Biden ramp up their campaigns for the November election, North Korea's leadership watches closely. CNN's Will Ripley explains what a second Trump term could mean for the tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.

            The trip could also be an important opportunity for the upper echelons of China’s political establishment to better understand the circumstances in North Korea today.
     
            Only handful of Chinese officials have visited the country since it eased pandemic controls last year – a period during which Pyongyang has ramped up rhetoric around its nuclear weapons development and unveiled a major policy shift away from seeking reunification with South Korea.
     
            “China probably needs to understand what’s happening and what’s the real intention of the North Korean leader … given that (North Korea) just recovered from Covid and shifted its policies … apart from routine communication, China needs to get more information,” Liu said.
     
            For North Korea, the visit provides an opportunity to tighten its ties with its most important international partner, as it seeks to bolster itself against expanding drills and security cooperation between the US and South Korea, which Kim sees as a threat to his regime.
     
            China has long walked a thin line in its relations with North Korea.
     
            It is a critical economic lifeline for a North Korea crippled by international sanctions over its illegal weapons testing. The two also have close historical and ideological ties and fought together during the Korean War of the 1950s.
     
            Today, Beijing stands to benefit when US attention is drawn away from itself and toward Pyongyang’s provocative rhetoric and weapons testing. But it also has a strong interest in ensuring that Kim’s posturing doesn’t spark a potentially devastating conflict in the region – or draw more US forces there.
     
            “When China’s regional geopolitical situation (has) deteriorated, you will see China became a lot more supportive or accommodating to North Korea,” said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.
     
            “When China feels the geopolitical pressures from the US and from regional states in Asia-Pacific becoming less, you will see stronger desire on the part of Beijing to put pressure on North Korea’s nuclear policy, missile policy,” he said.
     
            China is also likely paying close attention to the enhanced cooperation between North Korea and Russia, where Kim made a visit last year to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.

            Beijing, which has expanded economic, diplomatic and security ties with Russia following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, has declined to comment on any transfer of arms transfer from North Korea to Russia, calling their cooperation a “matter between those two sovereign states.”
     
            It also abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote last month to extend monitoring North Korea’s violations of UN sanctions. The measure was vetoed by Russia.
     
            But while the three authoritarian countries share security concerns and opposition to the American network of alliances, Beijing is also wary of any optics that it’s forming an axis with Russia and North Korea, according to Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.
     
            “China doesn’t want to return to an iron triangle with North Korea and Russia,” and also may not want to see Pyongyang’s relations with Moscow dilute its own influence, she said.
     
            “But China plays a critical and irreplaceable role in both economies and the Russia-(North Korea) rapprochement has not threatened or damaged China’s interests yet.”

            Fitch downgraded its outlook on China’s credit rating on Tuesday, citing increasing risks to its finances as it faces economic challenges.
     
            Lowering its outlook from stable to negative does not automatically mean the ratings agency will downgrade China’s creditworthiness, but it increases the chances.
     
            Fitch has kept its rating on Chinese sovereign bonds at A+.
     
            The revision “reflects increasing risks to China’s public finance outlook as the country contends with more uncertain economic prospects amid a transition away from property-reliant growth to what the government views as a more sustainable growth model,” it said in a statement.
     
            Fitch believes the general government deficit will rise to 7.1% of gross domestic product in 2024 from 5.8% last year. This year’s deficit is expected to be the highest since 2020, when pandemic related controls began to weigh heavily on public coffers.
     
            China’s Finance Ministry has expressed “regret” over the revision.
     
            “We had a lot of in-depth communication with the Fitch Ratings team in the early stage, and the report partly reflected China’s views,” it said in a Wednesday  statement.
     
            It added that the agency’s methodology “fails to effectively and prospectively reflect the positive role of fiscal policy in promoting economic growth.”
     
            “In the long run, maintaining a moderate deficit and making good use of precious debt funds will help expand domestic demand, support economic growth, and ultimately help maintain good sovereign credit,” it said.
     
            The fiscal budget deficit ratio for 2024 is set at 3%, according to the statement, which describes it as “overall moderate” and “conducive to stable economic growth.”
     
            The ministry has targeted 5% for economic growth for this year, which it says is “in line with realistic conditions.”
     
            “The long-term positive trend of China’s economy has not changed, nor has the Chinese government’s ability and determination to maintain good sovereign credit,” it said.
     
            In December, rival ratings agency Moody’s downgraded its outlook on China’s credit rating from stable to negative, citing risks related to “structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth” and ongoing troubles in its property sector.

            China’s gaming giant NetEase will bring back the iconic “World of Warcraft” and other popular video games by Microsoft’s Blizzard Entertainment to the country, the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.
     
            California-based Blizzard and Hangzhou-based NetEase had ceased their 15-year relationship in 2023 after an acrimonious fallout, leaving millions of fans in China heartbroken.
     
            “After a year of negotiations, Blizzard and NetEase are pleased to align on a path forward to once again serve players in mainland China,” the companies said in a post on NetEase Games’ official Weibo account.
     
            The new deal will see the return of “World of Warcraft” and “Hearthstone” games to China, as well as other titles in the Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and StarCraft universes, according to the statement.
     
“World of Warcraft,” also known as “WoW,” is a hugely popular online multiplayer game that allows users to fight monsters and journey through expeditions in the medieval world of Azeroth.
     
            The games will “sequentially return to the Chinese market beginning this summer,” the companies said, adding they will share further details at a later date.
     
            “We are thrilled to embark on the next chapter, built on trust and mutual respect, to serve our users in this unique community that we’ve built together,” said William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director, NetEase.
     
            Foreign publishers must work with local partners to offer video games in China. In November 2022, however, Blizzard and NetEase announced they would not renew licensing deals as they were unable to agree on key terms.
     
            Separately, Microsoft Gaming and NetEase have also entered into an agreement to explore bringing new titles by the Chinese company to Xbox consoles, according to the statement Wednesday. Microsoft had completed its takeover of Activision Blizzard— one of the world’s biggest video game developers— in 2023.
     
            “Blizzard’s universes have been part of players’ lives in the region for many years. Returning Blizzard’s legendary games to players in China while exploring ways to bring more new titles to Xbox demonstrates our commitment to bringing more games to more players around the world,” said Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming.
     
            China has launched a crackdown in recent years on its massive online gaming industry, as Beijing seeks to reverse what it sees as a growing trend of gaming addiction among young people.
     
            In 2021, China barred online gamers under age 18 from playing on weekdays and limited their play to just three hours most weekends.
     
            That was part of Beijing’s wider clampdown targeting what it sees as overly powerful companies, especially in Big Tech.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/09/china/xi-jinping-lavrov-russia-china-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,Chinese leader Xi meets Russia’s Lavrov as two partners tout strong ties,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with top Russian diplomat Sergey Lavrov in Beijing Tuesday, state media reported, in yet another sign of the importance Beijing gives to its increasingly robust ties with Moscow.","Apr 10, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with top Russian diplomat Sergey Lavrov in Beijing Tuesday, state media reported, in yet another sign of the importance China gives to its increasingly robust ties with Moscow.
     
            Lavrov is making a two-day visit to the Chinese capital, which comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin last month suggested he was considering China for his first overseas trip after extending his one-man rule with a stage-managed election victory last month.
     
            The Kremlin on Tuesday confirmed that such a visit was “in the works,” saying Lavrov’s trip could be viewed as “preparations for upcoming interaction at the highest level,” state-run news agency Tass reported. But a spokesperson declined to provide exact dates.
     
            During his meeting with Lavrov, Xi pledged to strengthen communication with Russia and said Beijing supports Moscow in “maintaining social security and stability,” according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi also noted the two countries’ shared drive to reform “global governance” – an allusion to their joint efforts to reshape what they see as Western-dominated world.
     
            Lavrov said “consolidating and enhancing” relations with China was the “priority of Russia’s foreign policy,” according to Chinese state media.
     
            It was Xi and Lavrov’s first direct meeting in six years and notable as heads of state do not necessarily meet with visiting ministers. Their last meeting in 2018 came weeks before a state visit from Putin to China — his first such trip after winning another highly orchestrated Russian presidential election that year.
     
            Since then, the two countries have ramped up their economic, trade and diplomatic relations – including in the wake of Putin’s war in Ukraine.
     
            Beijing claims neutrality in the conflict but has emerged as a key economic lifeline for the isolated Russian economy and a staunch diplomatic partner for Moscow as both push back against what they see as containment from the West.
     
            When a Russian lawmaker last month expressed his hope that Putin’s symbolic first overseas trip of his new term would be to China, Putin said he would take that “into account.”

            Putin last visited Beijing in October for the Belt and Road Forum. Xi made a state visit to Moscow last March after entering his third term as Chinese president.
     
            Lavrov also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier Tuesday.
     
            Wang touted the countries’ ties as being elevated to “the highest level in history,” and alluded to their shared views on the United States by saying they would “oppose a Cold War mentality,” according to comments made during a joint news conference following their meeting, cited by Chinese state media.
     
            The two sides discussed Ukraine and agreed that international meetings on the war ignoring Moscow’s interests “are futile,” Lavrov told the conference, according to Tass.
     
            Wang told his counterpart that China supports holding an international peace conference “recognized by both Russia and Ukraine,” with “equal participation by all parties and where all peace plans are discussed fairly,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.
     
            The remarks come as questions mount about how to end the war in Ukraine.
     
            Previous rounds of international peace conferences have been backed by Kyiv and not included Moscow, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seeks broad support for his peace formula, which calls for the complete withdrawal of Russian troops.
     
            China has maintained dialogue with Switzerland about an upcoming international peace conference, according to state media, but previously said such talks should be recognized by both Ukraine and Russia.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/asia/us-japan-philippines-summit-advance-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,China concerns bring new unity to once-turbulent US-Japan-Philippines relationship ahead of major White House summit,"When the leaders of the US, Japan and Philippines meet on Thursday, a key topic binds their relationship – common concern over China.","Apr 9, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Brad Lendon,China,"
            Colonization, bloodshed, war crimes, occupation, controversial military bases. These are all issues intertwined in the collective history of the United States, Japan and the Philippines.
     
            But when the leaders of the three countries sit down at the White House on Thursday, a key topic will be a much more present-day worry that binds their relationship – a common concern over China.
     
            “The perceived threat of China has really driven these three together,” said James D.J. Brown, associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, ahead of this week’s summit between US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
     
            But it is a possible conflict over Taiwan – the democratically ruled island that China’s Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it – that dominates strategic thinking.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control and has not renounced the use of force to do so.
     
            The Taiwan Relations Act obligates Washington to provide weaponry for the island’s defense, and Biden has repeatedly suggested he would use US military personnel to defend it in the event of a Chinese invasion (though White House officials have said the US policy to leave that question ambiguous has not changed).
     
            Both the Philippines and Japan are US defense treaty allies, and the US military retains permanent bases in Japan and has base rights in the Philippines.
     
            That threat is manifested in three key areas – Taiwan, the South China Sea and the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, analysts say.
     
            In the event of conflict, China could not ignore either with less than a few hundred kilometers of water separating both the Philippines and Japan from Taiwan, analysts say.
     
            “If you’re China, you cannot invade Taiwan, without dealing with the Philippines first, or dealing with the Japanese bases as well,” said Micah Jeiel Perez, an assistant professor at the University of the Philippines Diliman.
     
            Both Marcos and Kishida have made plain that peace in Taiwan is essential to their national security.
     
            “Should there in fact be conflict in that area … it’s very hard to imagine a scenario where the Philippines will not somehow get involved,” Marcos told Nikkei Asia in an interview last year.
     
            Japanese officials have previously pointed out that 90% of their country’s energy needs are imported via the water around Taiwan, tying Japan’s economic stability to Taipei’s autonomy.
     
            Those sea lanes extend into the South China Sea, which gives Japan a vested interest in keeping it part of a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” a term coined by former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that has become a mantra for US military presence in the region.
     
            “Japan and other parts of the world actually are very much dependent on maritime traffic that passes through the South China Sea,” said Ricardo Jose, also a professor at the University of the Philippines.
     
            “In Japan’s case, it is very strategic. It’s a strategic necessity that they protect those sea lanes,” Jose said.
     
            In an interview with CNN on Sunday ahead of the summit, Kishida called the Philippines “an important partner in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”
     
            “I believe that this historic meeting will be a very valuable opportunity to demonstrate to the world how the three countries can work together for peace and stability in the region,” he said of the upcoming three-way summit in Washington.
     
            Japan and Philippines both have separate territorial disputes with China, in the former’s case the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and in the latter’s areas of the South China Sea.
     
            Philippines-China tensions have focused on Second Thomas Shoal, which sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s, the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Philippine marines stationed on rotation.
     
            Meanwhile, China claims the shoal, which is in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, as its sovereign territory, as it does much of the South China Sea, in defiance of an international arbitration ruling.
     
Recent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels.
     
            Marcos has vowed not to submit to Chinese intimidation, and the US has steadfastly said the US-Philippines mutual defense treaty covers Second Thomas Shoal and the Philippine forces involved.
     
            When it comes to the Senkakus – called the Diaoyus by China – Washington has also reiterated repeatedly that they are covered by the US-Japan mutual defense treaty as Beijing has been keeping a steady presence of its coast guard vessels around the Japanese-controlled islands.
     
            The Chinese tactics have united Biden, Kishida and Marcos in a way that few might imagine given the complex and often troubled trilateral history involved, analysts say.
     
            The Philippines became a colony of the United States in 1899 after Spain ceded control of its longtime territory to Washington as part of the settlement of the Spanish-American war.
     
            But Philippine nationalists fought against US control in the 1899-1902 Philippine-American War, during which more than 4,200 US troops, 20,000 Filipino troops and 200,000 Filipino civilians died, according to a US State Department history.
     
            During World War II, the Philippines, still a US colony, was subject to a brutal invasion by the forces of Imperial Japan, with as many as 1 million civilian and military deaths, according to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans.

A double dose of hell: The Bataan Death March and what came next
 
            Tens of thousands of Filipino soldiers died during the infamous Bataan Death March and in the prison camps where they were interned at its terminus.
     
            A post-war trial would find the Japanese commander in the Battle of Bataan and the man responsible for the troops that carried out the Death March, Gen. Masaharu Homma, guilty of war crimes. He was executed in 1946.
     
            But analysts say the World War II history with Japan is forgotten – if not quite forgiven – in the Philippines.
     
            The country has immediate, pressing social, economic and political problems to deal with that effect the everyday lives of its citizens, Perez, the University of the Philippines’ professor, said.
     
            So despite any lingering grievances, the “cold calculus of geopolitics” means keeping Japan and the United States as allies is the Philippines best option for issues of territorial sovereignty, Perez said.
     
            “Alliance building is the most practical way to deal with China’s moves” in the South China Sea, he said.
     
            Analysts note how fast things have changed in the Philippines, even for that US base access. Under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos Jr’s predecessor, any US military access to the country where it once maintained two of its largest overseas military installations, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, was in doubt.
     
            Duterte looked more favorably on relations with China than the US and at one point threatened not to renew agreements that let the US military operate on the soil of its former colony.
     
            But Marcos has gone in the opposite direction, cozying up to Washington to push back against Chinese attempts to squeeze the Philippines out of territorial claims like Second Thomas Shoal.
     
            Meanwhile, the Biden administration is setting up what Robert Ward, Japan chair at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, called a “latticework” of alliances around China, rather than a “hub-and-spoke” system where bilateral ties went out to a range of foreign capitals with Washington at the center.
     
            Like the trilateral US-Japan-Philippines relationship in focus this week, the US, Japan and South Korea have also increased defense cooperation; key US ally Australia has established new defense ties with Japan, India and the Philippines; the Philippines is importing military hardware from India; Japan is strengthening security ties with Vietnam.
     
            One lattice was on display Sunday as warships and planes from the US, Japan and the Philippines were joined by forces from Australia for their first-ever Multilateral Maritime Cooperative Activity in the South China Sea.
     
            Analysts say that with the latticework alliance approach, the hope of the Biden administration, as well as like-minded leaders in the Pacific, is that it will have the stability to withstand possible changes in leadership, especially with a presidential election coming in the US in November.
     
            Brown, the Temple University professor, called the approach “future-proofing.”
     
            “Even if you have these mechanisms created, they can still be bulldozed. But at least you’ve got something that you’ve created, and you hope that it would last through a (Donald) Trump presidency,” Brown said.
     
            “It’s a very fragile set of flowers that are blooming in the Indo-Pacific,” said Ward at IISS. “They need watering and fertilizing every day.”

            US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is wrapping up her second trip to China, where she raised American concerns about Chinese overproduction, warned against support for Russia and, unexpectedly, caused a stir on Chinese social media over her travel style and chopstick-wielding skills.
     
            Over the span of four days, Yellen had wide-ranging meetings with Chinese leaders, local officials, academics, students and American executives both in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou as well as the capital Beijing.
     
            The visit, her second to China in nine months as treasury chief, is aimed at addressing escalating trade disputes between the world’s largest economies as the two sides try to stabilize relations following a summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last November.
     
            Despite the overall positive tone of Chinese state media coverage, Yellen had a tough message for Beijing: China’s surging exports of state-subsidized electronic vehicles (EVs), solar panels and batteries are threatening American jobs and businesses, and must be reined in.
     
            At a news conference on Monday, Yellen said she expressed concerns to senior Chinese officials that there are features of the Chinese economy that have “growing negative spillovers” on the US and the world.
     
            “I am particularly worried about how China’s enduring macroeconomic imbalances —namely its weak household consumption and business overinvestment, aggravated by large-scale government support in specific industrial sectors — will lead to significant risk to workers and businesses in the United States and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.
     
            Here are four key takeaways from her trip:
     
            The issue of Chinese overcapacity in key industries such as EVs and solar panels has emerged as a major area of contention globally and in the run-up to November’s US presidential election.
     
            It was also a major focus of Yellen’s trip. She has repeatedly relayed the message to Chinese officials from Vice-Premier He Lifeng, known as the country’s economic tsar, to Premier Li Qiang.
     
            “China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity,” Yellen told reporters Monday. “Actions taken by the PRC today can shift world prices. And when the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products, the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.”
     
            But there’s little sign that Beijing is willing to budge on its economic policies.

            In his meeting with Yellen on Sunday, Li, the Chinese premier, urged Washington not to “politicize” economic and trade issues or “overstretch the concept of national security,” but to adhere to “the basic market economy norms of fair competition and open cooperation.”
     
            “The United States should look at the capacity issue objectively and dialectically from the perspective of market economy and a global vision” Li told Yellen, according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.
     
            Beijing is aware of the country’s overcapacity problem, having acknowledged it as a key challenge at an annual economic work conference in December.
     
            But last month, several Chinese state media outlets published editorials challenging the notion that China’s supply glut poses a threat to other economies. “What China exports is advanced production capacity that meets the needs of foreign customers,” the Xinhua news agency wrote.
     
            At the news conference, Yellen conceded that concerns over Chinese oversupply will not be resolved in a week or a month, but “the exchanges that we announced during this trip will provide a dedicated structure for us to raise our concerns about China’s imbalances and overcapacity — among a wide range of other topics — in a detailed and targeted manner.”
     
            In a meeting with He, the economic tsar, in Guangzhou, Yellen warned that Chinese companies could face “significant consequences” if they provide material support for Russia’s war on Ukraine, according to a readout from the Treasury Department.
     
            China has emerged as a key economic lifeline for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine as the United States and its allies cut trade and imposed sanctions to choke off the Kremlin’s war effort. Beijing has claimed neutrality and called for peace in the conflict, but it has also avoided criticizing Russia’s aggression and deepened economic, diplomatic and military ties with its neighbor.
     
            US intelligence has warned that China is providing technology and equipment to Russia that is important to Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The Biden administration has imposed trade restrictions on Chinese companies for violating US sanctions.

            On Monday, Yellen said she had “difficult conversations” about national security with Chinese officials.
     
            “President Biden and I are determined to do all that we can to stem the flow of material that is supporting Russia’s defense industrial base and helping it to wage war against Ukraine,” she said. “We continued to be concerned about the role that any firms, including those in the PRC, are playing in Russia’s military procurement.”
     
            “I also reinforced that any banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to Russia’s defense industrial base expose themselves to the risk of U.S. sanctions,” she added.
     
            Asked about Yellen’s comments at a news conference Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said “normal cooperation in various fields between China and Russia should not be interfered with or restricted.”
     
            “Relevant countries should not attack and discredit China’s normal state-to-state relations, and should not harm the legitimate rights and interests of China and Chinese companies,” said ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.
     
            Yellen’s trip is part of efforts by Washington to maintain regular open lines of communication with Beijing to manage competition and prevent unintended conflict, after bilateral relations plunged to a low point early last year.
     
            Her visit also came days after Biden and Xi spoke on the phone last week, in the first conversation between the two since their in-person summit in San Fransisco in November.
     
            “It is undeniable that the US-China relationship is on stronger footing today than this time last year,” Yellen said on Monday. “And during this trip, we have been able to build on that foundation to move the ball forward on specific issues that matter to Americans.”

            But she warned that this does not mean the two powers have resolved all their differences.
     
            “President Biden and I are clear-eyed about the complexities of this relationship. Our priorities include protecting our national security and that of our allies, advancing an objective of a healthy economic relationship with a level playing field for American workers and firms, and cooperating with China where both countries can and must.”
     
            Yellen also met with China-based American executives and relayed their concerns about doing business in the country to Chinese officials, particularly after the raids by Chinese authorities on consulting firms last year.
     
            “On each side, we need to be as transparent as we can about our national security concerns and how the actions we take will lead to resolving those concerns,” Yellen said on Monday in response to a question by CNN’s Marc Stewart.
     
            “When we’ve put restrictions in place, we’ve proposed rules, gone through a full rulemaking process in which we take comments and make very clear what the rules of the game are. And I think that would be helpful on the Chinese side as well.”
     
            While Yellen talked tough at times, she received an unusually warm welcome in China, especially on social media, where anti-American sentiment has been running high in recent years.
     
            Some of it comes down to her personal style — including her reported love for Chinese food. During her last visit to Beijing, Yellen dramatically boosted business for a Yunnan restaurant chain and its mushroom dish after her delegation was spotted dining there.
     
            Yellen caught the attention of Chinese social media users from the moment she landed in Guangzhou on Thursday afternoon, when she exited the plane carrying a briefcase and a plain cross-body bag.
     
            Online commentators noted her down-to-earth style, with some comparing her to a Beijing “dama” — a Chinese term used to describe a middle-aged woman.

            “Yellen came like an ordinary traveler. She got off the plane alone, had a bag slung across her body and a handbag in her hand. To be honest, as a senior official, she is so down-to-earth!​” a comment said on Weibo, a popular social platform.
     
            “It doesn’t matter what’s in her bags. The important thing is she didn’t have to show off (her power) and didn’t need a whole entourage crowding over her,” said another comment.
     
            Chinese officials usually travel with numerous assistants who carry their personal belongings, sometimes shielding them with umbrellas when outdoors.
     
            Online commentators also marveled at Yellen’s dexterity with chopsticks, after a Weibo account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV released a short video showing her dining at a Cantonese restaurant in Guangzhou.
     
            The restaurant chain, Tao Tao Ju, is almost 150 years old. Yellen’s menu included classic dim sum dishes such as shrimp dumplings, egg tarts and pan-fried turnip cakes, as well as entrees including roasted goose, sweet and sour pork and stir-fried beef noodles.
     
            “(I) noticed Yellen uses chopsticks quite well,” the CCTV reporter said in the post. “As a US official, Yellen needs to know more about China than just its food. Only by understanding China better, can she correct the US worldview and its views of China and China-US relations.”

            Shanghai-based property giant Shimao Group said on Monday that it had received a liquidation petition from a Chinese state-owned bank in yet another instance of creditors taking legal action to reclaim money from troubled developers in the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            A “winding-up petition” was filed against the company by China Construction Bank (Asia) on April 5 in Hong Kong, according to a stock exchange filing by Shimao. The petition is in “connection with a financial obligation of the company in the amount of approximately HK$1,579.5 million ($204 million),” the filing said.
     
            Shimao said it will “oppose the petition vigorously” and will continue to work toward an offshore restructuring that maximizes value for its stakeholders.
     
            “The company is of the view that the petition does not represent collective interests of the company’s offshore creditors and other stakeholders,” it said.
     
            Shimao’s debt troubles date back to July 2022, when it failed to pay the interest and principal on a $1 billion bond. The company’s shares were down over 14% in Hong Kong on Monday, having fallen nearly 40% this year.
     
            China’s massive real estate sector fell into trouble after the government clamped down on excessive borrowing by developers in 2020 in an attempt to cool the property bubble. Since then, dozens of Chinese developers have defaulted on their debts.
     
            The industry has since become a drag on the broader economy, which is grappling with a slow recovery from three years of pandemic lockdowns and a series of headwinds, from record-high youth unemployment to mounting financial stress at local governments.
     
            In January, Evergrande, the world’s most-indebted property developer and the poster child of China’s property crisis, was ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court.
     
            The liquidation order, made by the city’s High Court, came after the embattled Chinese real estate giant and its overseas creditors failed to agree on how to restructure the company’s massive debt during talks that went on for 19 months.
     
            There are still questions about how the collapse of Evergrande will affect investors, thousands of workers and homebuyers waiting for their apartments.
     
            Country Garden, another major developer that defaulted on its debt last year,  received a liquidation petition in February from a creditor after not repaying a loan.

            Janet Yellen has kicked off her second visit to China as US treasury secretary with a warning of the risk to jobs and businesses posed by overproduction of certain goods in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            On Friday, her first full day of meetings in the southern megacity of Guangzhou, Yellen said she would address the oversupply of Chinese goods in key industries, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.
     
            The issue has quickly emerged as a major area of contention globally and in the run-up to November’s US presidential election.
     
            “Overcapacity isn’t a new problem, but it has intensified, and we’re seeing emerging risks in new sectors,” Yellen told a group of China-based American executives. “This can undercut the business of American firms and workers, as well as of firms around the world, including in India and Mexico.”
     
            She first mentioned the issue at an earlier meeting with the leaders of Guangdong province, the country’s economic powerhouse.
     
            US officials and lawmakers have expressed concern that China’s overinvestment and excess capacity could result in cheap products flooding global markets, affecting local industries and employment.
     
            Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether she would consider trade barriers if China doesn’t heed warnings on overcapacity, Yellen said she “wouldn’t want to rule [it] out,” though she wasn’t planning any immediate measures.
     
            Last month, on a visit to a solar panel factory in Georgia, Yellen said China’s excess capacity was distorting prices and production patterns and hurting American firms and workers. She added that China was following its old practice of flooding the global markets with cheap, state-subsidized steel and aluminum.

            She also hinted on that trip that the surge in China’s exports of EVs, solar panels, and batteries was creating a problem at a time when the United States has invested heavily in reviving its own manufacturing sector.
     
            For its part, Beijing is aware of the country’s overcapacity problem, having acknowledged it as a key challenge at an annual economic work conference in December.
     
            But last month, several Chinese state-owned media outlets published editorials challenging the notion that China’s supply glut poses a threat to other economies. “What China exports is advanced production capacity that meets the needs of foreign customers,” the Xinhua news agency wrote.
     
            At the meeting hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce, Yellen flagged concerns about what she called China’s “shift away from a market approach on the US and global economy” by providing state subsidies to some manufacturing industries.
     
            She referred to her host city of Guangzhou to make a point about the importance of pragmatism and openness by invoking Deng Xiaoping, the late reformist leader who led China away from a planned economy and Maoist ideologies.
     
            “It was a key stop on Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 Southern Tour, when he renewed China’s commitment to these [market-oriented] reforms,” she said. “It’s a fitting place for me to emphasize the strong economic ties between the United States and China, and the benefits these ties can bring for both the US and Chinese economies.”

            The tour marked a critical point in modern Chinese history. That year, Deng, then 88, made a surprise visit to the special economic zones in Guangdong that he had established previously and confirmed China’s commitment to market-oriented reforms and economic liberalization.
     
            The tour, which happened during a period of political uncertainty, is widely considered to have revived the process of China’s reform and opening up, which had almost stalled after 1989.
     
            Yellen is scheduled to spend four days in Guangzhou and Beijing and is expected to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Vice Premier Liu He, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng and Finance Minister Lan Fo’an.
     
            On Friday afternoon, Yellen met with Vice Premier He Lifeng during which she emphasised the importance of a “level-playing field” for companies and workers in both countries.
     
            Following the meeting, He will host a dinner for Yellen.
     
            Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a non-partisan think tank in Washington, said tangible outcomes from the trip may be “limited.”
     
            “For now, China’s primary focus remains portraying itself as open for business and alleviating growing concerns about the government’s to-date meager measures to tackle the country’s looming economic downturn,” he said.
     
            Yellen told reporters traveling with her to China that the meetings should be seen as a “continuation of a dialogue” between the US and China since Biden and Xi’s November 2022 meeting at the G20 in Bali.
     
            Biden administration officials have suggested raising tariffs on Chinese imports to “level” the playing field for trade. As the US approaches the presidential race, candidates from both parties are trying to look tough on Beijing. Former President Donald Trump has threatened to slap 60% tariffs on imports from China if he is re-elected.
     
            Trade tensions are rising as Chinese leaders increasingly utilize a strategy of boosting manufacturing for export to make up for weak demand at home amid loss of economic momentum.
     
            Beijing has poured money into new industries such as EVs and batteries as it seeks alternative growth engines beyond the property sector, a major pillar of the Chinese economy, which has crumbled.
     
            “China accounts for a third of global production but only a sixth of global consumption, and this reality risks breaking the global trading system,” said Rick Waters, managing director of Eurasia Group’s China practice.
     
            “Xi’s emphasis on ‘new productive forces’ as the future driver of growth will only make matters worse in the absence of measures that boost domestic consumption.”
     
            Xi coined the term ”new productive forces” last year, highlighting the need for a new model for economic growth based on tech innovation. The “forces” are often referred to as emerging industries such as EVs, new materials and artificial intelligence.
     
            Conflict over trade is likely to grow further before the election, Waters said. He said the Section 301 investigation — which allows the US government to impose tariffs, fees or other restrictions to address unfair trade policies by foreign governments — and the likely realignment of Trump-era tariffs to increase barriers to EV and other imports are all on the table.
     
            Among other topics that Yellen plans to discuss with her Chinese counterparts include bilateral cooperation on countering illicit finance and working on global issues such as climate change and financial stability, according to the Treasury Department.
     
            But analysts don’t think Beijing is likely to budge on its economic policies.
     
            “Yellen’s upcoming meetings merely extend the illusion of constructive engagement between two superpowers — reinforcing, rather than resolving, China’s contentious course,” Singleton said.
     
            He believes Beijing wants to reduce the role of US multinationals in supply chains deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, while deepening its control over China’s private sector and international companies operating in China, noting recently enacted national security legislation in Hong Kong.

            Janet Yellen has kicked off her second visit to China as US treasury secretary with a warning of the risk to jobs and businesses posed by overproduction of certain goods in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            On Friday, her first full day of meetings in the southern megacity of Guangzhou, Yellen said she would address the oversupply of Chinese goods in key industries, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.
     
            The issue has quickly emerged as a major area of contention globally and in the run-up to November’s US presidential election.
     
            “Overcapacity isn’t a new problem, but it has intensified, and we’re seeing emerging risks in new sectors,” Yellen told a group of China-based American executives. “This can undercut the business of American firms and workers, as well as of firms around the world, including in India and Mexico.”
     
            She first mentioned the issue at an earlier meeting with the leaders of Guangdong province, the country’s economic powerhouse.
     
            US officials and lawmakers have expressed concern that China’s overinvestment and excess capacity could result in cheap products flooding global markets, affecting local industries and employment.
     
            Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether she would consider trade barriers if China doesn’t heed warnings on overcapacity, Yellen said she “wouldn’t want to rule [it] out,” though she wasn’t planning any immediate measures.
     
            Last month, on a visit to a solar panel factory in Georgia, Yellen said China’s excess capacity was distorting prices and production patterns and hurting American firms and workers. She added that China was following its old practice of flooding the global markets with cheap, state-subsidized steel and aluminum.

            She also hinted on that trip that the surge in China’s exports of EVs, solar panels, and batteries was creating a problem at a time when the United States has invested heavily in reviving its own manufacturing sector.
     
            For its part, Beijing is aware of the country’s overcapacity problem, having acknowledged it as a key challenge at an annual economic work conference in December.
     
            But last month, several Chinese state-owned media outlets published editorials challenging the notion that China’s supply glut poses a threat to other economies. “What China exports is advanced production capacity that meets the needs of foreign customers,” the Xinhua news agency wrote.
     
            At the meeting hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce, Yellen flagged concerns about what she called China’s “shift away from a market approach on the US and global economy” by providing state subsidies to some manufacturing industries.
     
            She referred to her host city of Guangzhou to make a point about the importance of pragmatism and openness by invoking Deng Xiaoping, the late reformist leader who led China away from a planned economy and Maoist ideologies.
     
            “It was a key stop on Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 Southern Tour, when he renewed China’s commitment to these [market-oriented] reforms,” she said. “It’s a fitting place for me to emphasize the strong economic ties between the United States and China, and the benefits these ties can bring for both the US and Chinese economies.”

            The tour marked a critical point in modern Chinese history. That year, Deng, then 88, made a surprise visit to the special economic zones in Guangdong that he had established previously and confirmed China’s commitment to market-oriented reforms and economic liberalization.
     
            The tour, which happened during a period of political uncertainty, is widely considered to have revived the process of China’s reform and opening up, which had almost stalled after 1989.
     
            Yellen is scheduled to spend four days in Guangzhou and Beijing and is expected to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Vice Premier Liu He, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng and Finance Minister Lan Fo’an.
     
            On Friday afternoon, Yellen met with Vice Premier He Lifeng during which she emphasised the importance of a “level-playing field” for companies and workers in both countries.
     
            Following the meeting, He will host a dinner for Yellen.
     
            Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a non-partisan think tank in Washington, said tangible outcomes from the trip may be “limited.”
     
            “For now, China’s primary focus remains portraying itself as open for business and alleviating growing concerns about the government’s to-date meager measures to tackle the country’s looming economic downturn,” he said.
     
            Yellen told reporters traveling with her to China that the meetings should be seen as a “continuation of a dialogue” between the US and China since Biden and Xi’s November 2022 meeting at the G20 in Bali.
     
            Biden administration officials have suggested raising tariffs on Chinese imports to “level” the playing field for trade. As the US approaches the presidential race, candidates from both parties are trying to look tough on Beijing. Former President Donald Trump has threatened to slap 60% tariffs on imports from China if he is re-elected.
     
            Trade tensions are rising as Chinese leaders increasingly utilize a strategy of boosting manufacturing for export to make up for weak demand at home amid loss of economic momentum.
     
            Beijing has poured money into new industries such as EVs and batteries as it seeks alternative growth engines beyond the property sector, a major pillar of the Chinese economy, which has crumbled.
     
            “China accounts for a third of global production but only a sixth of global consumption, and this reality risks breaking the global trading system,” said Rick Waters, managing director of Eurasia Group’s China practice.
     
            “Xi’s emphasis on ‘new productive forces’ as the future driver of growth will only make matters worse in the absence of measures that boost domestic consumption.”
     
            Xi coined the term ”new productive forces” last year, highlighting the need for a new model for economic growth based on tech innovation. The “forces” are often referred to as emerging industries such as EVs, new materials and artificial intelligence.
     
            Conflict over trade is likely to grow further before the election, Waters said. He said the Section 301 investigation — which allows the US government to impose tariffs, fees or other restrictions to address unfair trade policies by foreign governments — and the likely realignment of Trump-era tariffs to increase barriers to EV and other imports are all on the table.
     
            Among other topics that Yellen plans to discuss with her Chinese counterparts include bilateral cooperation on countering illicit finance and working on global issues such as climate change and financial stability, according to the Treasury Department.
     
            But analysts don’t think Beijing is likely to budge on its economic policies.
     
            “Yellen’s upcoming meetings merely extend the illusion of constructive engagement between two superpowers — reinforcing, rather than resolving, China’s contentious course,” Singleton said.
     
            He believes Beijing wants to reduce the role of US multinationals in supply chains deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, while deepening its control over China’s private sector and international companies operating in China, noting recently enacted national security legislation in Hong Kong.

            The world’s biggest chipmaker is working to resume operations following the massive earthquake that struck Taiwan Wednesday — a welcome sign for makers of products ranging from iPhones and computers to cars and washing machines that rely on advanced semiconductors.
     
            A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the island’s east coast Wednesday morning, the strongest in 25 years, killing nine and causing landslides and collapsed structures.
     
            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the leading chipmaker also known as TSMC, operates largely on the opposite side of the island, although the company said its facilities did experience some shaking. TSMC temporarily evacuated some manufacturing plants following the quake but said later Wednesday that staff were safe and had returned to their workplaces.
     
            “A small number of tools were damaged at certain facilities, partially impacting their operations. However, there is no damage to our critical tools,” TSMC said in a statement late Wednesday.

7.4 magnitude quake hits Taiwan, strongest in 25 years
 
            While Wednesday’s earthquake appears unlikely to have any long-term implications for the semiconductor supply chain, it gave a stark reminder of the risks of concentrating crucial microchip manufacturing on an island that is both prone to earthquakes and a hotspot for geopolitical tensions. Chipmakers and governments, including the US government, have in recent years invested billions in efforts to diversify chip production, but many experts worry that process is not happening fast enough.
     
            TSMC produces an estimated 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductor chips, which power countless devices people rely on daily. Its chips are used by tech giants including Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia and AMD — and they’re essential for the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry, where chip supply is already constrained.
     
            “I believe it’s an existential threat,” said David Bader, professor and director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology, of the concentration of chipmaking in Taiwan.
     
            “The entire world now works on semiconductor devices powering everything that we do, whether we’re driving in our cars, whether we are talking on our cell phones, even our military defenses or weapons systems, airlines, everything uses chips,” Bader said. “If production were to halt … this would be devastating.”
     
            TSMC bolstered its earthquake protections in the years following Taiwan’s last major earthquake in 1999.
     
            As of late Wednesday, the company said that more than 70% of the tools in its fabs had been recovered within 10 hours of the earthquake, with recovery levels higher in some newer facilities. TSMC said impacted facilities were expected to resume production throughout Wednesday night.
     
            As of Thursday, TSMC said it expected to have fully recovered operations of all of its facilities by the end of the day. However, it noted that “certain production lines in areas which experienced greater seismic impact are expected to require more time for adjustment and calibration before returning to fully automated production.”
     
            Even an hours-long shutdown of certain chip production could take weeks to recover from.
     
            “Some of the high-end chips need 24/7 seamless operations in vacuum state for a few weeks,” Barclays analysts said in an investor note Wednesday, adding that operation halts could mean “some high-end chips in production may be spoiled.” They noted that TSMC could see a $60 million impact to its second quarter earnings from the disruption.
     
            The potential broader ripple effects for the tech industry will also depend on what kind of chip manufacturing was affected, something that wasn’t immediately clear on Wednesday, according to Gartner analyst Joe Unsworth. Tech companies that rely on GPU chips that help power AI applications, which are already in short supply, will likely be watching closely for potential impacts on that area of production.
     
            Nvidia, the leading designer of GPUs, said in a statement Wednesday that “after consulting with our manufacturing partners, we don’t expect any impact on our supply from the Taiwan earthquake.”
     
            Some other semiconductor and technology manufacturers — including smaller chipmaker United Microelectronics Corporation, memory and storage chipmaker Micron and Apple supplier Foxconn — said Wednesday they were also evaluating the potential impacts of the earthquake on their Taiwan facilities but indicated that they expect little fallout.
     
            Wednesday’s earthquake will likely only add pressure to efforts underway for years to grow chipmaking capacity outside of Taiwan.
     
            Other disasters, including the Covid-19 pandemic and droughts, have previously weighed on semiconductor production in the region and caused chip shortages that raised the prices of consumer goods. Supply chain experts and US officials also worry that US-China trade tensions and military aggression from China against the island could bring consequences for the industry.

            “We think the earthquake should serve as a reminder to investors of the risks associated with having so much foundry exposure coming from one region,” CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said in an investor note Wednesday.
     
            In 2022, US President Joe Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated more than $200 billion in investment over the next five years to help the United States regain a leadership position in semiconductor manufacturing.
     
            And in recent years, TSMC has announced plans for new semiconductor fabs in Japan, Germany and the United States. But plans for its second factory in Arizona — which was announced in 2022 and originally expected to be operational this year — have been repeatedly delayed.
     
            Experts say it’s a sign that the diversification of the chip supply chain is not moving quickly enough to account for the risks of remaining concentrated in Taiwan. Locations for new fabs must have companies or governments willing and able to invest billions to construct the facilities, as well as a large workforce with the skills to do advanced semiconductor manufacturing.
     
            “I think that we are in a critical period for the next several years, until there is a location for a major fab like TSMC that is in a less geopolitical hot zone than Taiwan,” Bader said. “We are really working in a challenging arena for several more years as we wait for that to happen.”

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/china-reopens-mount-everest-tibet-intl-hnk/index.html,China reopens Mount Everest access to foreigners,"For the first time since the pandemic, China is allowing foreign climbers to access Mount Everest via Tibet.","Apr 4, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Lilit Marcus,China,"
            For the first time since the pandemic, China is allowing foreign climbers to access Mount Everest via Tibet.
     
            Adrian Ballinger, who has summited Everest eight times, is one of the Western guides who prefers the Tibet route to the top of the world’s tallest mountain (from the north), as opposed to the more well-known Nepal route (from the south). This year, he will lead a group of climbers through his company, Alpenglow Expeditions.
     
            Rather than a tourism official or council in Beijing, all passes to use the Chinese route up the mountain, which is known in China as Qomolangma, are distributed by the China Tibet Mountaineering Association (CTMA).
     
            There is also no official announcement released by the Chinese government notifying the public that passes will be given out.
     
            As a result, says Ballinger, the best way for a non-Chinese climber to know that the Tibet side of Everest will be open is when the CTMA sends out a price list for the season. These lists include the costs of yaks (which carry gear up and down the mountain), local guides, translators and transport from Tibet’s capital of Lhasa to Everest Base Camp.

Everest climbers will have to take their poop away with them, as Nepal tries to address growing waste problem
 
            Foreigners who obtain tourist visas to China must get an additional, separate permit for Tibet, which is a semi-autonomous region. The CTMA assists with this for climbers.
     
            There are a maximum of 300 permits available annually for non-Chinese climbers.
     
            The window to climb Everest is small – usually between late April and mid-May. Ballinger’s team will arrive in China on April 25 after pre-acclimatizing at home to save time.
     
            While Nepal has the more famous and more photographed path to the peak of Everest, the greater number of visitors correlates to more trash, more erosion and more human waste.
     
            However, this wasn’t always the case.
     
            “Climbing from the Chinese side used to be more popular than climbing from the Nepali side. So from about 2000 to 2007, the Chinese side was the more popular side, and it was commonly understood that the reason it was more popular is because it was safer,” explains Ballinger.
     
            So what changed?
     
            In 2008, China hosted the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Before arriving in the capital, the Olympic Flame traveled to Everest, despite the fact that there were already groups of tourists ready to tackle the world’s highest peak.
     
            “Eight days before we all arrived on the mountain in 2008, they shut down the mountain for the entire season, and a lot of people lost a lot of money,” says Ballinger. “And because of that decision, the business shifted to the Nepali side in that year.”
     
            Now, with foreign climbers able to access Everest via the northern route through Tibet for the first time since 2020, that trend may slowly begin to reverse.

            The European Union has launched investigations into two groups of companies that include Chinese solar panel makers in the latest salvo against what it suspects is unfair competition from China’s vast manufacturing sector.
     
            The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Wednesday that it would assess whether foreign subsidies enabled the two consortia to submit “unduly” competitive offers when bidding for a contract to build and operate a solar park in Romania partly funded by EU money.
     
            The two groups include subsidiaries of China’s LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. and Shanghai Electric Group Co., a state-owned enterprise.
     
            “There are sufficient indications that both (consortia) have been granted foreign subsidies that distort the internal (EU) market,” the European Commission said in a statement.

            The new investigations follow an EU probe into China’s state support for its electric vehicle makers and allegations by European biodiesel producers that China has been “dumping” the renewable fuel into the EU market — that is, exporting it at artificially low prices. The European Commission has said it may impose tariffs on Chinese biodiesel imports if dumping is confirmed.
     
            Like biodiesel, solar panels are an important part of Europe’s efforts to transition to an economy powered by clean technologies.
     
            Commissioner Thierry Breton, in charge of the EU’s internal market, said in the statement Wednesday that solar panels are “strategically important” for Europe — namely, “for our clean energy production, jobs… and security of supply.”
     
            Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, voiced a broader concern last month, telling reporters: “Europe cannot just accept that strategically viable industries constituting the European industrial base are being priced out of the market.”
     
            China, for its part, is not backing down.
     
            Last month, Premier Li Qiang told the country’s parliament that China would focus on exporting more of its “new trio” of products, namely electric vehicles, solar panels and lithium batteries.
     
            And, in January, China opened its own anti-dumping investigation into brandy imports from the EU.

            Chinese internet giants are buying back their shares at a record pace, as they try to boost their market value in the midst of a historic stock rout in the world’s second largest economy.
     
            Alibaba Group (BABA) announced Tuesday that it had bought back $12.5 billion of shares from the US and Hong Kong markets, representing 5.1% of its outstanding shares, in the fiscal year ended March 31.
     
            That would mark the biggest share repurchase by a Chinese tech company in the past year.
     
            In the first quarter alone, Alibaba spent $4.8 billion in buybacks, its second biggest quarterly repurchase in history.
     
            A share buyback usually triggers an increase in price because there will be fewer shares available on the market.
     
            Alibaba’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value in the past year.
     
            The tech giant’s move comes at a time when Chinese regulators have been asking listed companies to repurchase shares to stabilize market confidence.
     
            China’s stock markets have suffered a protracted slump since their peaks in 2021, with more than $4.5 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong bourses.
     
            “Alibaba’s decision signals confidence in the company’s future prospects and demonstrate management’s belief in the underlying value of Alibaba’s shares,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management.
     
            But whether the move will give a long-term boost to the share price depends on various factors, including broader market conditions, investor sentiment towards Chinese stocks and Alibaba’s ability to execute its growth strategies effectively, he added.

            The Hangzhou-based company has signalled it would buy more. In February, it raised its share buyback plan by another $25 billion through March 2027.
     
            Alibaba has joined a series of Chinese tech companies that have ramped up share buybacks in the past year.
     
            Tencent spent a record 49 billion Hong Kong dollars ($6.3 billion) repurchasing shares in 2023, more than it had spent in total over the past decade, according to the company’s public records.
     
            Last month, the gaming and social media giant pledged to “at least double” the size of its share repurchase to over 100 billion Hong Kong dollars ($12.8 billion) in 2024.
     
            Tencent’s share price has slumped 20% in the past twelve months.
     
            CNN has reached out to Alibaba and Tencent for comment on their repurchase plans.
     
            Other Chinese companies — including Meituan, Kuaishou and Xiaomi — have also ramped up share buybacks in the past year.
     
            Overall, companies listed in Hong Kong spent 126 billion Hong Kong dollars ($16.1 billion) buying back shares in 2023, the highest on record, according to Chinese financial data provider Choice. Tencent alone accounted for about 40% of total share buybacks in the Hong Kong market.
     
            Firms listed in mainland China repurchased 120 billion yuan ($16.6 billion) worth of stocks, more than doubling the amount spent in 2022, according to government statistics.
     
            These efforts are part of a wider campaign by Beijing to draw a line under the stock rout.
     
            In February, the government pumped money into stocks via the country’s sovereign wealth fund and replaced the head of its securities regulator in an apparent attempt to appease public anger.
     
            The efforts appear to have bought Beijing some relief, as the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets have rebounded more than 10% from their recent lows in early February. But they don’t address the underlying challenges the economy faces.
     
            “Investors are worried about China’s economic slowdown, particularly amid challenges such as debt levels, property market risks, and demographic shifts,” Innes said.
     
            Additionally, the global selling of Chinese assets, driven by geopolitical tensions or concerns about regulatory uncertainties, has further pressured Chinese share prices.
     
            While share buybacks can potentially boost investor confidence by signaling management’s belief in the company’s future prospects and its commitment, their impact on reviving global investor confidence in Chinese stocks may be “limited in isolation,” he said.

            China’s sprawling security apparatus has a far-from-cuddly reputation, but the country’s most popular new police officer is making waves on social media with his stubby legs, wide grin and wagging tail.
     
            Fuzai the corgi puppy, whose name means “Lucky Boy,” is a reserve police dog in Weifang, a city in the eastern province of Shandong. The uniformed pooch made his debut at an open-day event organized by Weifang police earlier this month, according to state-run media.
     
            He immediately became a social media phenomenon, with one video of Fuzai viewed more than 1.3 million times on the Chinese platform Weibo, where a related hashtag has been viewed nearly 16 million times.
     
            Fuzai began training at two months old and now, at six months, is outperforming many of his peers, according to state media.
 
            Some of these peers are featured on Fuzai’s official account on Douyin – the Chinese version of TikTok - with the account run by Weifang police. Videos show other puppies in training, including a bloodhound named Coffee and an explosives detection dog named Dumpling.
     
            Other videos show Fuzai doing drills like locating firecrackers under a car – and being swarmed by adoring members of the public during walks.
     
            One popular video with 38,000 “likes” shows a line of fiercely professional-looking German Shepherds – a breed used by police departments around the world for their strength and intelligence – walking beside their trainers, many wearing muzzles.
     
            At the end of the line is Fuzai – strapped to the back of an officer, paws dangling, like a fuzzy backpack.
     
            “His strong environmental adaptability, insensitivity, his desire to possess items and his fondness for food are particularly conducive to our training,” said Wang Yanan, head of the Weifang police dog base, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.

            His short legs also give him an advantage over other dogs in searching narrow spaces, the newspaper added, citing police.
     
            Fans on social media joked that Fuzai’s universal appeal made him a “publicity dog” – and asked whether other dogs would bully him for his short legs. One Douyin user wrote: “Corgis can be plainclothes police, they attract less attention than German Shepherds.”
     
            Others expressed envy at Fuzai’s cushy government job – which are in high demand in China due to their stable pay and generous benefits, often dubbed the “iron rice bowl.”
     
            “Look at Shandong! Even the corgi baby has passed the (civil servant) exam!” one Weibo user exclaimed.
     
            Another Douyin user said, “He has a job…with the Shandong department…which I could not get,” accompanied with a number of tearful emojis.
     
            The country’s police forces range from public security departments and neighborhood patrols to more heavy-handed state security and paramilitary forces as well as a highly secretive civilian spy agency.

            Chinese police dogs have attracted national attention (and adoration) before. On 2021, a police academy in Liaoning province gained online traction for auctioning off dogs that failed to qualify in the police dog training program.
     
            Many had failed for being “timid,” “weak” or “frail” – sparking a wave of amusement and sympathy from online users.

            China’s factories are churning out more steel, cars and solar panels than its slowing economy can use, forcing a flood of cheap exports into foreign markets.
     
            The oversupply of Chinese goods in key industries is stoking tensions between the world’s biggest manufacturer and its major trading partners, including the United States and the European Union. Its global trade surplus in goods has soared and is now approaching $1 trillion.
     
            The United States and the EU are fretting over potential “dumping” by China — that is, exporting goods at artificially low prices — with electric vehicles among the products caught in the crosshairs.
     
            “Europe cannot just accept that strategically viable industries constituting the European industrial base are being priced out of the market,” Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters earlier this month.
     
            But China needs to increase exports as a key measure to revive its economy, which is grappling with a protracted property slump, weak household spending and a shrinking population among other problems.
     
            Beijing is now focusing on higher-value exports, after investing billions into advanced manufacturing. But the move is badly timed, coming amid slower economic growth globally and a shift by Western consumers from pandemic-era spending on goods to travel and leisure.
     
            It is also coming up against a push by Europe and the United States to reduce their dependence on China and boost local manufacturing, creating jobs — including through the Net-Zero Industry Act and the Inflation Reduction Act respectively.
     
            “It is hard for me to imagine that Europe would just sit by and quietly witness (its own) accelerated de-industrialization… because of the externalization of low domestic demand in China,” Eskelund said.
     
            According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, prices of Chinese exports are at their lowest level since 2009, when the West was reeling from the global financial crisis.
     
            And China’s surplus in goods trade has more than doubled since the pandemic, according to Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2019, the country exported an estimated $400 billion more in goods than it imported — a surplus that ballooned to $900 billion last year.
     
            China’s exports of low-priced goods got a boost after it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Its economy and heft as a manufacturer have also grown substantially since then.
     
            Having conquered the production of clothing and consumer electronics, China has come to dominate electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines — industries viewed as strategically important in Europe and the United States as they seek to green their economies and reduce planet-heating pollution.
     
            Europe’s solar panel producers have been all but wiped out by Chinese competition, and the same fate threatens its wind industry.
     
            “European companies could fall behind (Chinese manufacturer) Goldwind, which already offers its turbines well below the price of the established (European) manufacturers,” Markus W. Voigt, CEO of the Aream Group, an asset manager specializing in renewable energy, said in a statement this month.
     
            In the last three months of 2023, China’s BYD overtook Tesla (TSLA) as the top seller of EVs worldwide, capping an extraordinary rise for the Warren Buffett-backed carmaker. Compared with Tesla, BYD’s cars are more affordable, which has helped it attract a wider range of buyers. Its entry-level model sells in China for the equivalent of just under $10,000. The cheapest Tesla car, a Model 3, costs almost $39,000.
     
            Alongside “surging EV exports,” China manufactures 80% of the world’s solar panels and makes more wind turbines than any other country, Setser wrote in a recent note. “Chinese policy continues to emphasize upgrading China’s capacity in advanced manufacturing as a major driver of future growth,” he added.
     
            Earlier this month, Premier Li Qiang, Xi’s number two, told China’s parliament that the government would focus on exporting more of the country’s “new trio” of products, namely EVs, lithium batteries and solar panels.
     
            Eskelund of the European Union Chamber of Commerce says the organization is seeing “overcapacity across the board” in China, whether in the production of chemicals, metals or EVs.
     
            “We haven’t seen all that capacity coming online just yet. This is something that’s going to hit markets over the next few years,” he added.
     
            Beijing is aware of China’s overcapacity problem, acknowledging it as an issue for the first time in almost a decade at an annual meeting of senior officials in December.
     
            But on the eve of this week’s China Development Forum, several Chinese state-owned media outlets published editorials challenging the notion that China’s supply glut poses a threat to other economies.
     
            “What China exports is advanced production capacity that meets the needs of foreign customers,” Xinhua News Agency wrote.
     
            Washington and Brussels have a different view, however. US President Joe Biden recently pledged to investigate whether imports of Chinese vehicles pose a national security threat.
     
            “A dynamic auto industry is vital to the US economy,” he said in a statement last month. “China is determined to dominate the future of the auto market, including by using unfair practices. China’s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security.”

            The EU, meanwhile, is looking into China’s state support for EV makers, which it suspects may be enabling these firms to keep prices super-low, creating unfair competition with European rivals.
     
            European officials are also considering whether existing measures to safeguard the EU steel industry should be extended or adjusted, as well as investigating allegations of biodiesel dumping by China following a complaint by European producers. Biodiesel is a renewable alternative to fossil fuels used in the EU’s transport sector.
     
            The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in December that it might impose tariffs on Chinese biodiesel imports if dumping was confirmed.
     
            China, for its part, is fighting back. It said this week that it had filed a complaint with the WTO to contest “discriminatory subsidy policies” for EVs under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Earlier this year, Beijing opened an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU.
     
            If there is a silver lining to China’s influence in global trade, it’s that it should help keep goods prices and overall inflation in check in advanced economies this year, according to Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
     
            “But perhaps more importantly, persistent oversupply and low prices of Chinese goods will add to geopolitical tensions and keep the threat of tariffs and counter-tariffs alive,” she wrote in a recent note. And these could ultimately raise inflation in the years ahead, she said.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping has told Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte that “no force can stop China’s scientific and technological development.”
     
            Xi’s comments come as a chip war rages between China and Western countries, including the Netherlands, which is home to ASML — the world’s sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors.
     
            “Artificially creating technological barriers and cutting off industrial and supply chains will only lead to division and confrontation,” Xi told Rutte during a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday, according to a readout published by China’s foreign ministry.
     
            There was no mention of ASML in the readout, but the company said in January that it had been prohibited by the Dutch government from shipping some of its lithography machines to China.
     
            That came after the United States ramped up restrictions on the types of semiconductors that American companies can sell to China and pressed its allies to enact their own.
     
            Because of its dominance in the market, ASML has been cited by experts as a bellwether of the growing rift between China and the West over access to advanced technology.

            “The Chinese people also have the legitimate right to development,” Xi added in the meeting. “[We] hope that the Netherlands will continue to play an active role in promoting mutual understanding and developing constructive relations between China and Europe.”
     
            On the same day, Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao met with Dutch Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen, and asked for “normal trade” of lithography machines, without mentioning ASML.
     
            “We hope the Dutch side can support companies in fulfilling their contractual obligations,” Wang was quoted as saying in a readout of the meeting on the commerce ministry’s website.
     
            There was a surge in sales of ASML’s advanced chipmaking tools to China last year — ahead of the Dutch ban.
     
            In the fourth quarter of 2023, China accounted for 39% of ASML’s total revenue, according to the company. Although that was slightly lower than the 46% in the third quarter, it had increased nearly fivefold from the 8% in the first quarter.
     
            For 2023 as a whole, China’s share of ASML’s revenue was 29%, doubling from 14% in 2022.
     
            “We believe China has spared no effort in buying as many high-end [chipmaking] tools as it can since the rules were finalized, as ASML’s sales of net system to China witnessed a big surge since the second quarter of 2023,” Jefferies analysts said in a research report last month.

            “China’s access to [these high-end chipmaking] machines is key to its commercialization of 7-nanometer logic chips,” they added.
     
Last year, Chinese manufacturer Huawei shocked industry experts by introducing a new phone powered by a 7-nanometer processor made by China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC).
     
            SMIC, which is partially state-owned, was included in the export restrictions set up by the US government several years ago.
     
            At the time of the Huawei phone launch, analysts could not understand how the company would have the technology to make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology.
     
            “China has been aggressively buying semiconductor equipment to build out production lines in both advanced and mature nodes,” according to Jefferies.

            China has announced it is lifting punishing tariffs on Australian wines more than three years after imposing penalties that devastated the industry and were a major point of friction between the trading partners.
     
            China’s Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that “in view of the changes in the wine market conditions in China,” it was “no longer necessary to impose anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties on imported wines originating from Australia.”
     
            The measure would come into effect on Friday, two days before the end of a five-month review period agreed on by Canberra and Beijing that saw Australia suspend a dispute on the issue at the World Trade Organization for that period.
     
            The decision scraps duties as high as 218% on Australian wine exports to China, its largest overseas market once worth more than 1 billion Australian dollars ($653 million).
     
            The Australian government said it welcomed Beijing’s decision “which comes at a critical time for the Australian wine industry.”
     
            “Since 2020, China’s duties on Australian wine effectively made it unviable for Australian producers to export bottled wine to that market,” the statement read. “We acknowledge and thank Australian grape growers and wine producers for their fortitude and support during a challenging period.”
     
            The wine tariffs were part of a raft of trade curbs Beijing slapped on key Australian exports starting in 2020 as punishment for political grievances.
     
            Their removal comes amid a thaw in China-Australia relations that’s seen Chinese authorities steadily roll back a number of those barriers including on barley, timber, and coal.
     
            Beijing’s move was embraced by the country’s hard-hit winemakers, who have been grappling with oversupply amid flagging broader global demand on top of years of major revenue losses from China.
     
            “There are a lot of people in the Australian wine industry who will be reaching out for a good glass of wine tonight and feeling a whole lot happier about their future,” Bruce Tyrrell, managing director of Tyrrell’s Wines in New South Wales, told CNN.
     
            “The loss of China over these last three years has caused a fair bit of damage to the industry and brought uncertainty. We don’t know what the Chinese market looks like after (the Covid-19 pandemic), but having access to it is a lot better than not,” he said.
     
            Tariffs of up to 212% were originally introduced by China’s Ministry of Commerce in November 2020. A final ruling the following March set between 116% to 218% antidumping and countervailing duties for a five-year period.

How China is devastating Australia’s billion-dollar wine industry
 
            The wine duties were a sharp hit for the key Australian industry, with sales to China down 97% in 2021 from the previous year at a loss of nearly 1 billion Australian dollars in value and 90 million liters in volume, according to national industry group Wine Australia.
     
            Global exports also dropped by 30% in value during that period.
     
            Annual wine production hit its lowest point in more than 15 years during 2022-2023, Wine Australia said. The same year, the United Kingdom and the US became the country’s most valuable export markets.
     
            Lee McLean, head of national association of grape and wine producers Australian Grape & Wine, said industry groups were working with the Australian government to “ensure a coordinated re-entry” into the market.
     
            “We look forward to seeing Australian wines back on Chinese dining tables and rejuvenating our relationship with customers and busin﻿ess partners in that market,” McLean said.
     
            “We will also, however, be maintaining our focus on diversifying our export footprint and growing demand here in Australia as well,” he added.
     
            China imposed the wine tariffs and other trade controls amid a souring of relations between the two countries over issues of national security and foreign investment, which deteriorated further in 2020 following Canberra’s call for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry had blamed Australia for the trade issues, in 2020 accusing it of “violating the basic norms governing international relations,” though its commerce ministry has cited anti-dumping and other reasons for the raft of curbs.
     
            Relations began to improve after the election of Anthony Albanese’s Labor government in May 2022 allowed for a reset of relations, but the wine tariffs had remained a sore point.
     
            On Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the two countries “for some time” had “properly addressed each other’s concerns through dialogue and negotiations, and jointly pushed for the momentum for improvement in bilateral relations.”

            Earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the first trip by China’s top diplomat to the Australia in the same period.
     
            During that visit, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong raised ongoing points of stress between the two, including China’s sentencing to death last month of imprisoned writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen detained in China since 2019.
     
            Wong also said she stressed Canberra’s desire for the removal of remaining curbs on beef and lobster.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping met more than a dozen US CEOs and academics on Wednesday as Beijing renewed efforts to woo back foreign investors and mend strained relations with the United States.
     
            Foreign direct investment in China has slumped in recent months as a combination of slower growth, regulatory crackdowns, onerous national security legislation and questions about the country’s long-term prospects have shaken confidence in the world’s second biggest economy.
     
            The group of CEOs included Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm (QCOM), Raj Subramaniam of FedEx (FDX) and Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group (BX).
     
            Xi invited US businesses to “continue to invest in China” and pledged further reforms to open the country’s markets to foreign firms, according to a readout of the meeting published by the foreign ministry.
     
            “China’s growth prospects are bright, and we have the confidence,” he said, adding that the country’s economy has not yet peaked.
     
            Xi also called for “a better future” between China and the US. “Whether it is traditional fields such as economy, trade and agriculture, or emerging fields such as climate change and artificial intelligence, China and the United States should help boost each other’s development,” he said.
     
            Bilateral relations have already shown improvement since he met with US President Joe Biden in San Francisco in November, Xi added.
     
            The optics of Xi’s meeting with the US visitors were carefully managed by Chinese state media.
     
            Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV shows Xi’s American guests diligently taking notes and nodding in agreement as the Chinese leader speaks. Meanwhile, photos released by state-run news agency Xinhua show the US participants walking behind Xi in unison on a red carpet.
     
            A striking group photo taken before the meeting also raises questions about who wasn’t invited — with not a single woman among the line-up of American CEOs and academics.
     
            “These appear to be senior visitors attending the China Development Forum, but the lack of gender/ethnic/age diversity is pretty glaring – and unrepresentative of the true range of expertise or policy perspective on China in the US,” Sheena Chestnut Greitens, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas-Austin, wrote on social platform X.
     
            The meeting at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People came after the close of a major government forum that has invited global business leaders to engage with Chinese officials over many years.
     
            About 100 global CEOs, as well as the heads of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, were in the Chinese capital this week for the annual China Development Forum. More than 30 of them are US executives, according to Chinese state media.
     
            Beijing is trying to revive confidence and stabilize foreign trade and investment as the country faces its biggest economic challenges in decades. It has rolled out a series of measures since last year, including a 24-point action plan published by the cabinet earlier this month, to attract foreign investment and expand market access in high-tech sectors.

            But global investors remain wary of China’s rising scrutiny of Western companies as well as a structural slowdown.
     
            In the first two months of 2024, foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country shrank nearly 20% from a year ago, underscoring weak confidence among global executives.
     
            That fall came after a decline of 8% in 2023, according to the Commerce Ministry.
     
            Another gauge of FDI — direct investment liabilities — showed an 82% slump in 2023, according to figures released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. It was the lowest in 30 years.
     
            According to a survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China last month, 57% of US firms lacked confidence that China would further open its markets to foreign companies.
     
            China has set this year’s economic growth target at around 5%, the same as last year’s. But market watchers say the goal is “ambitious,” given a lack of major stimulus measures by the central government to directly address Chinese consumers’ weak confidence and their unwillingness to spend.
     
            The world’s second largest economy is plagued by a myriad of problems. They include a prolonged downturn in real estate, deflation, debt, a shrinking population and a shift in economic policy toward ideological objectives that has rattled the private sector and scared away foreign investors.

            Five Chinese workers and their local driver were killed in a suicide bomb blast in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, authorities said, the latest in a string of terror attacks that the South Asian country’s military and government say aims to disrupt Islamabad’s close ties with Beijing.
     
            Senior police official Muhammad Ali Gandapur said the explosion occurred when the bomber rammed a vehicle into the workers’ convoy as it traveled from the capital to the Dasu dam, the country’s largest hydropower project, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
     
            The blast is the third atrocity in a week to rock Pakistan, a strategic ally of China and a key link in Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, underscoring the mounting security challenges for Chinese projects in the country.
     
            No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s blast, which comes nearly three years after a bus explosion killed 13 people including nine Chinese workers on their way to the dam in another unclaimed attack on the project.
     
            Pakistan has been grappling with a surge in violence from militant and terrorist groups since the Taliban seized power in neighboring Afghanistan following the withdrawal of American troops in 2021. The Pakistani Taliban denied any involvement in Tuesday’s blast.
     
            China strongly condemned Tuesday’s attack.
     
            “China asks Pakistan to thoroughly investigate the incident as soon as possible, hunt down the perpetrators and bring them to justice,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday, urging Pakistan to take effective measures to protect the safety and security of Chinese nationals, institutions and projects.
     
            Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences for the death of the Chinese nationals during a visit Tuesday to the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, where he met with Beijing’s ambassador.
     
            Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “heinous act of terrorism,” and vowed to bring those responsible to justice.
     
            “Today’s attack was orchestrated by the enemies of Pakistan-China friendship. We will resolutely act against all such forces and defeat them,” he said in a statement.
     
            The blast Tuesday follows two militant attacks in recent days in southwest Pakistan, where China is investing billions in infrastructure projects.
     
            The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent of several separatist groups in restive southwest Balochistan province, claimed responsibility for the assaults on a Pakistani naval air base and a government complex outside the Chinese-funded strategic port of Gwadar.
     
            In a statement, Pakistan’s military said the attacks were aimed at destabilizing the country’s internal security and its relationship with China.
     
            “Strategic projects and sensitive sites vital for Pakistan’s economic progress and the well-being of its people are being targeted as a conscious effort to retard our progress and sow discord between Pakistan and its strategic allies and partners, most notably China,” the military said in a statement.
     
            Without naming any country, the military’s statement also accused “certain foreign elements” of aiding and abetting terrorism in Pakistan.
     
            Beijing has invested tens of billions of dollars in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship Belt and Road project launched in 2015 that links China’s western Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea with a network of roads, railways, pipelines and power plants.
     
            But Chinese-funded projects have sparked resentment from locals in parts of Pakistan, who say they have benefited little from the developments.
     
            The anti-China sentiment is particularly strong among separatist groups in Balochistan.
     
            In November 2018, the BLA claimed responsibility for an attack on the Chinese consulate in the city of Karachi, which killed four people. Half a year later, a separatist group attacked a luxury hotel in Gwadar, often used by Chinese nationals working at the port. In June 2020, the BLA said it was responsible for another deadly attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, where Chinese companies own 40% of the stakes.
     
            In August last year, BLA militants opened fire on a Pakistani military convoy in Gwadar as it was escorting a delegation of Chinese nationals to a construction project. Two militants were killed and no harm was caused to any military personnel or civilians, according to the Pakistani military.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/china/china-cyber-hacking-accusations-intl-hnk/index.html,"China hits back at US, UK for sanctions on espionage hacks as coordinated pressure on Beijing grows","Beijing has lashed out at the United States and the United Kingdom for imposing sanctions over what they say are Chinese government-backed cyberattacks, calling it an act of “political manipulation.”","Mar 26, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
            Beijing has lashed out at the United States and the United Kingdom for imposing sanctions over alleged Chinese government-backed cyberattacks, calling the Western allies’ move an act of “political manipulation.”
     
            The US and the UK announced Monday a set of criminal charges and sanctions against seven Chinese hackers for allegedly conducting sweeping attacks on behalf of China’s civilian intelligence agency.
     
            The yearslong campaign allegedly targeted American officials, senators, journalists and companies – including Pentagon contractors – as well as British parliamentarians, the UK’s election watchdog and members of the European Parliament, affecting millions of people.
     
            New Zealand also weighed in on Tuesday, accusing state-sponsored Chinese hackers of launching “malicious cyber activity” against the country’s parliament in 2021.
     
            Accusations of cyber espionage have long been a major point of friction between Beijing and Washington, with the US indicting a series of Chinese hackers in recent years.
     
            The public accusations from three members of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance show key Western democracies are now taking a more concerted – and coordinated – stand against what they view as unacceptable levels of hacking and espionage by Beijing.
     
            At a news conference Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry lashed out at the US and the UK, accusing them of “hyping up the so-called cyberattacks by China.”
     
            “This is purely political manipulation. China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, adding China has made solemn representations to both sides.

            “We urge the United States and the United Kingdom to stop politicizing cyber security issues, stop slandering and smearing China, impose unilateral sanctions, and stop cyberattacks on China.”
     
            The spokesperson did not mention New Zealand.
     
Australia and the European Union also expressed solidarity with the UK and voiced concerns over China’s alleged malicious cyber activities, as Beijing comes under growing scrutiny in a big election year for democracies around the world.
     
            The accusations and sanctions come as China is trying to manage tensions and repair frayed relations with major Western powers, as it grapples with a host of economic challenges including an exodus of foreign investment.
     
            Beijing’s frustration was evident on Tuesday, when Lin, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, blamed the US for encouraging the Five Eyes alliance “to spread all kinds of disinformation about the threats posted by Chinese hackers for geopolitical purpose.”
     
            Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at City University of Hong Kong, said the coordinated move by the US and its allies undermines Beijing’s “divide and rule” strategy.
     
            “My observation is that China has always sought to create some distance between the US and other Western countries, such as European nations and Australia. Especially considering the possibility of a reelection of Donald Trump, China feels there may be a chance to separate them a little more,” he said.
     
            “But (the accusations) show that despite their differences, these countries remain united on many issues regarding China.”
     
            The sanctions against two Chinese nationals and a technology company in the central Chinese city of Wuhan mark the first time Britain has slapped penalties on Chinese state-affiliated entities for alleged cyberattacks, even as Western intelligence agencies have increasingly sounded the alarm in recent years.
     
            “It is an escalation, but perhaps only because the UK has been rather mild in its previous actions,” said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor and China specialist at the University of Nottingham.
     
            British cybersecurity officials said a Chinese state-backed hacking group known as APT31 had “conducted reconnaissance activity” against British parliamentarians who were openly critical of Beijing in 2021.
     
            Chinese hackers have also “highly likely” breached the UK’s Electoral Commission in 2021 and 2022 and accessed personal data of 40 million voters, according to British officials.
     
            On Tuesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China had made “technical clarification” in response to the APT31-related information submitted by the UK, calling its evidence “insufficient” and “unprofessional.”
     
            The sanctions come at a sensitive time in the UK, which is facing a general election and bracing itself for a wave of misinformation, said Sullivan, the China expert at the University of Nottingham.
     
            “Our economic relations with China are already undergoing securitization, from investment to data protection,” he said, citing Britain’s bans on Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G networks, and on the camera systems of Chinese surveillance company Hikvision from sensitive sites.
     
            Last September, a British parliamentary researcher was arrested on suspicion of spying for China.
     
            The sanctions could risk disrupting the upward trajectory of UK-China ties, which have stabilized in the past year after years of deterioration following British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s “robust pragmatism” approach to foreign policy, Sullivan said.
     
            “I would be astonished if (Beijing) does not respond in kind. China does not tend to receive such actions without retaliation.”

            The former head of China’s official soccer association has been sentenced to life in prison by a court in the central Chinese province of Hubei, in the latest crackdown on the country’s corruption-plagued professional football league.
     
            The ex-soccer chief, Chen Xuyuan, was jailed on Tuesday alongside multiple senior sporting executives, according to state media, following a months-long investigation.
     
            Despite Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s vision to turn the country into a soccer superpower, its development of high-level professional soccer has been mired by poor financial decision making and deep-rooted corruption.
     
            Chen is among a host of soccer officials ensnared by the ruling Communist Party’s ongoing anti-graft probe, which also targeted the association’s former vice-president Yu Hongchen, former national team’s head coach Li Tie, and many others.
     
            Chen also had his assets confiscated and was stripped of his political rights for life, a penalty often slapped on disgraced officials, according to state media.
     
            In sentencing Chen, the Intermediate People’s Court in Huangshi said the defendant leveraged his position to aid companies and individuals he worked with in exchange for monetary rewards, state media reported.
     
            He pocketed $10.6 million (77 million yuan) out of $11.2 million (81 million yuan) he was offered on 217 occasions between 2010 and 2023, according to the court, which called the sum “outlandishly high.”
     
            “[His act] has seriously damaged the order and fairness in the football field and the ecology of the industry, causing severe damages to the national soccer business,” the court said.
     
            Footage showed Chen bowed from the dock. “I hereby apologize to the fans across the country and sincerely say sorry in the hope that I would be forgiven by them,” he said.
     
            The court said it showed leniency since Chen had “admitted and repented his crime” and cooperated with the investigation. China retains the death penalty, including for corruption.
     
            Separately, Chen Yongliang, former vice-secretary general of the soccer association, and Yu, former vice-president, were sentenced to 14 and 13 years, respectively. Dong Zheng, former The Chinese Super League general manager, was jailed for eight years.
     
            China is one of the world’s great sporting powers, with its athletes routinely dominating at major events like the Olympics and Winter Olympics. But it has historically had less success with globally popular team sports such as soccer, with its men’s team struggling to compete at a high level.
     
            Xi, an avowed soccer fan, has tried to change that.
     
            In 2011, Xi, then China’s vice-president, set his sights on the sport’s highest prize of all and outlined a three-stage plan for the men’s national team: to qualify for another World Cup, to host a World Cup and to win a World Cup.
     
            Five years later, the Chinese soccer association unveiled a plan to make the country a “world football superpower” by 2050. But an enduring culture of corruption and financial losses associated with the Covid pandemic have combined to hamper those efforts.
     
            The Chinese men’s soccer team currently sits third in its FIFA World Cup qualify group, with four points, behind group leader South Korea, and second placed Thailand. Last Thursday, the team drew 2-2 with city-state Singapore, in a major blow to the country’s World Cup 2026 dream. The two sides face off again, on Tuesday, in what is being billed as a crunch match for underperforming China.

Here’s how that’s going,"China’s ambitious plan to build a high-speed railway network through Southeast Asia is gaining speed. This is good news for tourists, but not everyone is ready to climb aboard.","Mar 26, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Heather Chen,China,"
            Imagine jumping on a train in southwestern China, traveling some 2,000 miles and arriving in Singapore – less than 30 hours later.
     
            That’s the scenario China is envisioning for Southeast Asia as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vast overseas infrastructure development program that launched more than a decade ago.
     
            In 2021, the semi-high-speed Laos-China Railway opened to passengers, connecting the southwestern Chinese commercial hub of Kunming to the Laotian capital of Vientiane – a roughly 10-hour journey spanning some 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) that officials claim has boosted numbers of overland Chinese travelers while greatly benefiting local vendors and businesses in the tiny land-locked country.
     
            Also with China’s help, Southeast Asia’s first bullet train began operating in Indonesia in October 2023 following years of setbacks and delays, connecting the capital Jakarta with Bandung in West Java, one of the country’s biggest cities and a significant arts and cultural hub.
     
            Meanwhile, a second high-speed rail project is underway in Thailand, which aims to connect the Laos-China Railway with Bangkok – but is now facing further delays and mounting construction costs. Launching in phases, the Thai government currently expects the full line to be operational by 2028. The Chinese government has not detailed a timeline.
     
            The project, seen by some analysts as a ‘fiscal trap’, has been a source of heated debate and scrutiny in Thailand, with the government agreeing to shoulder the full construction cost of $5 billion (179 billion baht) for the first building phase, reported Reuters. The Chinese side will be responsible for installing systems, design, and procurement of trains.

            And when that line is finally complete, the plan is to expand into northern Malaysia, where it will connect to the capital Kuala Lumpur before finally ending 350 kilometers (218 miles) down south in Singapore.
     
            In January, bids by local and international consortiums were submitted for the lucrative project. But Japanese firms, including the East Japan Railway Co, reportedly pulled out after deciding that it would be too risky without official financial support from the Malaysian government.
     
            “China already boasts the world’s largest high-speed railway network and Chinese firms have long been looking to sell and export their infrastructure technology to other countries,” says travel and consumer trends analyst Gary Bowerman, founder of Check-in Asia, a tourism-focused research and marketing company.
     
            Southeast Asia is the “obvious” choice because of its “proximity to China,” Bowerman adds.
     
            “Connecting mainland cities by train directly into Laos and other Southeast Asian countries (down the line) will make it easy, and advantageous, for Chinese travelers – many who aren’t looking to travel long distances, for long periods of time.”
     
            Offering everything from ancient temples in Laos and pristine beaches in Thailand to lush rainforests and eco-tours in Malaysia, Southeast Asia has long been a big draw for Chinese travelers, experts note.
     
            “Many countries share borders and long histories with China,” says political economist Pon Souvannaseng, assistant professor of global studies at Bentley University in the US.
     
            “China of course, sees Southeast Asia as a key market for export as well as a key area for security and I think, ultimately wants to see Southeast Asian countries within its sphere of geopolitical influence.”
     
            Interestingly, the region’s large Chinese diaspora is another big draw, experts add.
     
            “Cities like Penang and Malacca in Malaysia and Phuket Old Town, with temples and architecture, were built by Chinese immigrants and are very popular with Chinese tourists because of their historical and cultural links,” says Bowerman.
     
            Adding to this is the rise in popularity of rail travel – especially among younger Chinese tourists, many whom are committed to sustainable travel and looking for a new sense of adventure, Bowerman adds.
     
            Pan Wenbo, a 30-year-old security practitioner from Beijing, tells CNN that taking an epic train journey across Southeast Asia from his country, as opposed to flying, would have to be cheap and offer plenty of scenic views along the way. Pan has visited Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines in the past five years and says he is keen to explore other countries in the region.
     
            Others like university student Mei Wei have taken travel tips and inspiration from popular influencers on Chinese social media apps like Douyin – China’s version of TikTok – and Youku, the Chinese YouTube.
     
            Thanks to several travel videos she has seen in recent months, Wei says she is now planning a summer trip to Laos, Cambodia and possibly Thailand, to visit “unique attractions” like the Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap.
     
            She told CNN that she is particularly excited about traveling by train.
     
            “I’m not a big fan of flying. In China, I love taking trains because you get to see more on the ground (as compared to being on a plane from above) and travel more directly into the heart of cities.”
     
            “It also helps that prices are usually consistent and cheaper than booking flights when you are at the mercy of airlines,” she adds.
     
            China’s Belt and Road Initiative was launched at the beginning of Xi Jinping’s presidency.
     
            In addition to high-speed railways, multi-billion dollar sea bridges and highways, ports, airports, power plants and telecommunication networks are all playing a fundamental part in creating the new “Silk Road” that the ruling Chinese Communist Party desires.
     
            A lot of these projects, like the China-Laos Railway, were designed with economic interests in mind, experts say. According to Chinese state media, the China-Laos Railway cumulatively transported 4.22 million tons of freight in 2023, an increase of 94.91% year-on-year.
     
            Political economist Souvannaseng, who rode the train months after passenger services launched in April 2023, said it was “very clearly, even near the full construction and inauguration” a project for cargo transfer, with China and Thailand being the main nodes for trade and Laos being left footing the bill for the massive project.
     
            “It reminds me a lot of the Orient Express and the way it benefitted the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires while the hinterland Balkan territories were saddled with that debt and it hampered their economies well over a century later.”

            Chinese-funded and supported infrastructure projects are also widely viewed with suspicion and have been lambasted as attempts by Beijing to boost influence and gain control over smaller neighboring countries while having massive financial consequences for struggling countries.
     
            “Beijing, I think, ultimately wants to see Southeast Asian countries within its sphere of geopolitical influence. These projects have always been in Beijing’s strategic and geopolitical interests,” says Souvannaseng, who highlights the financial burden placed on Laos following its multi-billion dollar Chinese-funded railway project.
     
            “Money that was loaned to the Lao government through Chinese sovereign lending, has to be re-paid and soon. The immediate impact of that external debt for Laos is evident in the recurrent stress and fiscal crisis, and consequences for Lao society at large is pretty evident.”

China reports ‘record’ holiday travel data. But consumer spending isn’t roaring back just yet
 
            In Malaysia, where planning for a high-speed railway with neighboring Singapore is taking place, many experts have continually voiced strong opposition and exercised caution about sovereignty. Some have drawn parallels with the West Kowloon rail station in Hong Kong that opened to much fanfare as well as controversy in 2018.
     
            The $10.75 billion infrastructure investment connects Hong Kong to 44 mainland Chinese destinations, including major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. But it also allows mainland Chinese law to be applied on a section of the Hong Kong terminal station, a contentious arrangement that drew heated public criticism for undermining the city’s autonomy.
     
            Officials, on both sides, defended the station and high-speed railway as a tool to boost economic opportunities and a “convenient means of cross-boundary transport.” But critics – many in Hong Kong – said it was a development neither wanted nor asked for.
     
            “It has to do with fear, resentment and anxiety over China and perceptions of Hong Kong’s diminished standing vis-a-vis China,” experts told CNN at the time of its opening.
     
            “Any cross-country infrastructure will certainly involve multiple countries and governments and will concern the issue of sovereignty and laws,” says Wong Muh Rong, managing director and founder of corporate advisory firm Astramina Advisory in Kuala Lumpur. “In addition to costs, that in itself is a ginormous thing and not something that can be addressed easily.”
     
            Wong reiterated that while there were “definite advantages” to high-speed trains, the decision to build and launch one has to be balanced with costs and benefits.
     
            “In the example of a high-speed railway line between Malaysia and Singapore, Singapore would likely have just one stop – Malaysia would have more,” Wong told CNN. “But who will have the ultimate say? And if additional external funding comes from China, it will make things even more complicated.
     
            “For now at least, there is no need for a high-speed rail line between Malaysia and Singapore, especially when there are already efficient rail trains and flights less than three hours. The costs are just way too high and it would be too difficult to do.”

            The Biden administration on Monday announced a criminal indictment and sanctions against multiple Chinese hackers for allegedly conducting sweeping hacks against US companies and government officials on behalf of China’s civilian intelligence service.
     
            Seven Chinese men were indicted in US federal court in the Eastern District of New York and accused of being part of a yearslong hacking effort that resulted in the “confirmed and potential compromise” of data belonging to millions of Americans, some of “which could be released in support of malign influence” targeting US democratic institutions, the indictment states.
     
            The hackers targeted “some of America’s most vital critical infrastructure sectors,” including a defense contractor that made flight simulators for the US military, the US Treasury Department said while announcing sanctions against two of the men. The State Department announced a reward of up to $10 million for information on the seven men.
     
            The alleged hacking effort was vast. Over the course of just a few months in 2018, the hackers sent more than 10,000 malicious emails to senior US officials (and their advisers) in the White House, Justice Department and other agencies, and to Democratic and Republican senators in more than 10 states, according to the indictment. The hackers allegedly posed as prominent US journalists as a ruse to try to get targets to click on the emails.
     
            The US announcement came as the British government said the same broad group of Chinese hackers had “highly likely” breached the UK Electoral Commission in 2021 and 2022, and had conducted digital reconnaissance against British parliamentarians. The activity did not affect the UK electoral process or voters’ rights or registration, Britain’s foreign office said.
     
            CNN first reported earlier Monday that the US government actions were imminent.
     
            “Without valid evidence, the US jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said in a statement to CNN responding to the US announcement.
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry earlier Monday condemned reports that the British government was preparing to link Beijing to hacking operations targeting the UK Electoral Commission and lawmakers, telling reporters that it opposes countries “politicizing” cybersecurity.
     
            The moves come at a particularly delicate time in US-China cyber relations, weeks after FBI Director Christopher Wray issued a dire public warning that a different group of Chinese hackers was preparing “to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike.”
     
            At a meeting in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US election — an assurance that US officials are not taking at face value, CNN previously reported.
     
            Beijing has vigorously denied the US allegations of hacking and in turn accused the US of conducting its own hacking operations against China.
     
            The US announcement Monday focused on alleged Chinese cyber-espionage instead of the possible disruptive cyberattacks highlighted by Wray.
     
            US officials alleged the seven Chinese men named in the indictment have been using a Chinese technology company as a front to cover their hacking activity on behalf of China’s powerful Ministry of State Security. CNN has attempted to reach the company, known as Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company, for comment.
     
            The cybersecurity industry knows the hacking group as APT31 or Judgement Panda, and researchers have found the hackers targeting everything from US law firms to European industrial organizations to international apparel companies.
     
            Ahead of the 2020 US election, hackers associated with the group had unsuccessfully tried to break into email accounts of people affiliated with the Biden campaign, according to Microsoft. It was not immediately clear whether any of the men expected to be named this week were allegedly involved in that activity.
     
            Monday’s announcement isn’t the first time the Chinese government’s extensive cyber capabilities have been traced back to contractors working for front companies.
     
            A trove of documents leaked last month from another Chinese tech firm, I-Soon, showed victims of the firm’s hacking from Tibet to Hong Kong. Clients listed in contracts with the firm included China’s police, intelligence service and military, according to the leaked data.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/india/china-india-sela-tunnel-border-dispute-intl-hnk/index.html,A high-altitude tunnel is latest flashpoint in India-China border tensions,A tunnel constructed high in the mountains of its northeastern India has become the latest flashpoint in a simmering border dispute between New Delhi and Beijing.,"Mar 22, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"
            A tunnel constructed high in the mountains of northeastern India has become the latest flashpoint in a simmering border dispute between New Delhi and Beijing.
     
            The Sela Tunnel, inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month, has been hailed in India as a feat of engineering – blasted through the Himalayas at an elevation of some 13,000 feet (3,900 meters) – and a boon for the military, enabling faster, “all-weather” access to a tense de facto border with China.
     
            That’s caught the attention of Beijing, whose long-running dispute with New Delhi over their contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) border has seen the two nuclear-armed powers clash in recent years.
     
            That includes in 2020 when hand-to-hand fighting between the two sides resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers in Aksai Chin-Ladakh in the western stretches of the border.
     
            And, decades ago, the dispute led to war.
     
            China also claims the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the tunnel was constructed, as its own, even as the area has long functioned as Indian territory.
     
            Chinese officials in recent days have slammed the tunnel project and Modi’s visit to the state, accusing New Delhi of taking steps to undermine peace along the border.
     
            “We require the Indian side to cease any action that may complicate the boundary question … the Chinese military remains highly vigilant and will resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said last week, using the Chinese name “Zangnan” or South Tibet to refer to Arunachal Pradesh.
     
            India hit back on Tuesday, slamming Beijing’s “absurd claims” and saying the area “is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India.”
     
            The US State Department also weighed in during a news conference Wednesday backing India’s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh and voicing strong opposition to “any unilateral attempts to advance territorial claims by incursions or encroachments” across the line of actual control (LAC), or de facto border.

China’s new national map has angered its neighbors
 
            Beijing hit back at this too, accusing Washington of sparing “no efforts to provoke and take advantage of other countries’ conflicts to serve its selfish geopolitical interests.”
     
            The spat – which underscores the deep tensions undergirding the relationship between Asia’s two largest countries – comes as India is weeks away from national elections expected to deliver a resounding endorsement of Modi’s Hindu nationalist platform.
     
            Rising nationalism under Modi has come alongside a similar phenomenon in China, where leader Xi Jinping has overseen an assertive foreign policy – though both sides have appeared to take steps to cool border tensions following the deadly 2020 clash.
     
            Modi on Friday also traveled to Bhutan for a trip “aimed at further cementing the India-Bhutan partnership,” he wrote on social media platform X. The remote Himalayan country bordering Arunachal Pradesh too has a contested border with China, and New Delhi has been wary of a potential settlement between leaders there and in China over that dispute.
     
            During his visit to Arunachal Pradesh earlier this month, Modi praised the Sela Tunnel as an “engineering marvel,” while touting a host of other development projects, including those related to border infrastructure.
     
            Those projects are part of the intensified push by his government to develop Indian territory along the contested border. That push – which Beijing has signaled it is closely watching – reverses longstanding thinking from the Indian government that not developing the harsh terrain would have a deterrent effect on invasion or encroachment by China.
     
            Of 118 projects launched by India’s Border Roads Organization last year to build infrastructure like roads, bridges and airfields, more than half were in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, along the disputed border with China.
     
            Beijing has accused India of “complicating the boundary question and disrupting the situation in the border areas between the two countries” with such development.
     
            But observers say India is addressing an imbalance after decades of Chinese road and infrastructure building gave it a significant advantage over New Delhi in deploying troops to border areas, where it also constructed hundreds of “xiaokang,” or villages, which Beijing denies are meant to enforce its land claims.

            “Now that India has recognized the benefits of border infrastructure, it is accelerating its building efforts and playing catch-up to China. But its efforts are also likely to raise tensions with China and encourage Beijing to also redouble its own building efforts,” said Byron Chong, a research associate at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy’s Center on Asia and Globalization in Singapore.
     
            The Sela Tunnel, which runs from the state of Assam to Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang, has likely caught special attention from Beijing given the sensitivity of the area, which lies along the line of actual control. New Delhi has said the project will “boost the preparedness of the Armed Forces.”
     
            Tawang was the site of a non-lethal scuffle between the two sides in late 2022, according to Indian authorities. Then, New Delhi accused China’s People’s Liberation Army troops of trying to “unilaterally” change the status quo by attempting to cross the LAC.
     
            But Tawang may also be especially important to Beijing given its significance within Tibetan Buddhism and China’s concerns surrounding the succession of spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, according to Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in Bangalore.
     
            The Dalai Lama, 88, has lived in exile in India since a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule of Tibet, where Beijing has cracked down on religious practice and sought to exert its control over Tibetan Buddhism.
     
            “A lot of this pressure (on Arunachal Pradesh) right now is a product of anticipation of when that event takes place … (in terms of) how China wants India to respond to it and what could be the potential fallout,” he said.
     
            But even as the two sides build-up around the border – and China continues a push to entrench its territorial claims in its maps and official language, they have made diplomatic efforts to quell tensions following the deadly 2020 clash.
     
            During a meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in South Africa last August, Modi and Xi agreed to “intensify efforts” to deescalate tensions.
     
            The Indian and Chinese militaries have also continued to hold border talks, the most recent of which took place last month, when they reiterated a commitment to “maintain peace and tranquility.”

            Tim Cook is making a high-profile visit to China that coincides with Apple opening a huge new store in Shanghai — its second biggest in the world. It’s all part of a push by the company to reverse a decline in iPhone sales in its most important international market.
     
            The new $11.6 million outlet — located in Shanghai’s central district of Jing’an, which is named after a historic temple — is the biggest in China and the second only to Apple’s flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue, Chinese state media reported.
     
            “Nonghao Shanghai!” Apple CEO Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday, which means “hello” in Shanghainese. “I’m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city.”
     
            Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city’s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai.
     
            In Shanghai, mainland China’s financial hub, Apple now has eight stores, the largest number of any city in the country. There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China.
     
            The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds, ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment.

Apple iPhones sales fall 24% in China amid competition and headwinds
 
            In 2023, Apple grabbed the top spot in China’s smartphone market for the first time ever, with a record 17.3% market share, according to IDC Research.
     
            But during the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago, according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month. Apple’s market share slid behind that of Vivo, Huawei, and Honor in that period, it added, while rival Huawei’s sales soared 64%.
     
            Cook’s visit, his third to the country in a year, underscores China’s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain.
     
            “China remains a critical market for Apple, particularly in the premium segment above $800, where it holds a dominant position,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst from Counterpoint.
     
            “With Huawei’s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales, Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence, leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones,” he said.
     
            Earlier this month, Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year.
     
            “China is the heart and lungs of Apple’s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities.
     
            On Wednesday, Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple’s suppliers — BYD, Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology — at its Shanghai office, according to state media reports.
     
            “There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China,” Cook told a group of reporters.

            He met with Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, the world’s largest electrical vehicle maker, at the session, according to a video he posted on his Weibo account.
     
            Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having “the most advanced manufacturing in the world,” according to China Daily. 
 
            The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio, talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff, according to his social media posts.
     
            “Cook is not taking a step back from China. It’s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically,” Ives said.
     
            Apple still has many fans in the country. More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook, according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo.
     
            Others told CNN they were planning to go.
     
            “I’ll go and kinda ‘worship’ the store,” said Dolores, a movie producer in Beijing. She has been using the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for years. “I’ve already grown used to its design and the system,” she said, calling the products “sleek and beautiful.”
     
            Wei, a Beijing resident, also said he would visit.
     
            “I’ve heard that it’s quite big,” he said. “I just want to have a look.”
     
            Both said they would stay loyal to the brand, despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism.
     
            “Some Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products. But [I won’t switch.] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands], rather than hostility,” Dolores said.
     
            “For international products, if you like a brand, there should be no geopolitical divisions,” Wei said. “Just look at the products.”

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/entertainment/anna-may-wong-not-your-china-doll-cec/index.html,Hollywood’s first Asian American movie star has long been misunderstood. A new book seeks to change that,Katie Gee Salisbury tells CNN that her new book “Not Your China Doll: The Wild and Shimmering Life of Anna May Wong” aims to tell a different story about the actress.,"Mar 21, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Harmeet Kaur,China,"
            About two decades ago, Katie Gee Salisbury glimpsed a photo that would stay with her for years to come.
     
            The black-and-white image depicted a sea of parade-goers surrounding a convertible. In the back seat was a Chinese American woman looking ever so chic and glamorous.
     
            Salisbury, a fifth generation Chinese American with deep roots in Los Angeles’ Chinatown, was immediately captivated by the woman. It was her first day as an intern at LA’s Chinese American Museum, and a curator explained that she was looking at Anna May Wong: an internationally famous actress from the ’20s and ‘30s who is considered Hollywood’s first Asian American movie star.
     
            “I wanted to know more about who this woman was,” Salisbury says. “I couldn’t believe no one ever told me about her.”
     
            That photo ultimately inspired Salisbury’s new book, “Not Your China Doll: The Wild and Shimmering Life of Anna May Wong,” which published on March 12.
     
            As Salisbury readily admits, she’s not the first person to chronicle Wong’s life and career. But she felt that other biographies of the actress, though notable contributions to the study of Wong’s life, left something to be desired.
     
            “A lot of them are written by academics or by men, and I always personally felt that they were missing the perspective of an Asian American woman,” she adds.
     
            Previous biographers largely painted Wong as a tragic figure, according to Salisbury, overemphasizing rumors about her sexuality, her struggles with alcoholism and her decision to never marry.
     
            In “Not Your China Doll,” Salisbury set out to tell a different story.
     
            It’s true that Wong’s life was not without challenges — because of Hollywood’s racism, she was too often relegated to stereotypical, side parts and lost countless roles to White actors in yellowface.
     
            But as Salisbury points out, she had plenty of triumphs, too. Her title role in “The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong” marked TV’s first Asian American lead. The trailblazing star also captured the hearts of audiences and critics, and ultimately forged her own path in an otherwise prejudiced industry.
     
            Salisbury spoke with CNN about how Wong defied stereotypes of Asian women, how Hollywood has changed since Wong’s time and about how her own Asian American identity shaped the book.
     
            This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
     
You write in the preface that in addition to consulting primary sources and Wong’s niece, you also drew upon your “own personal and familial knowledge of what it’s like being Asian American in this country.” How did your identity shape how you told Wong’s story?
 
            I have a somewhat unique position. On the one hand, my Chinese American family has been in this country for five generations. We immigrated from the same place in southern China as Anna May Wong’s family, so there was definitely a kinship there just in the family history.
     
            I myself am mixed. I’m half Chinese and half Anglo Irish. I grew up in a very Asian community. But at the same time, people don’t always recognize me as Asian, so I don’t necessarily have the exact same experience that Anna May Wong and a lot of Asian American women have.
     
            What I really tried to do was just embody what I thought was Anna May Wong’s experience by just tapping into my own experiences and the experiences of my friends and family that have been shared with me. I put myself in her shoes when certain things happened to her.
     
            A good example I talked about in the book is when she was making “The Thief of Bagdad.” It was reported by Douglas Fairbanks — the star of the film and the producer — that there was an incident in which Anna May Wong wouldn’t put on the “Mongol slave” costume.
     
            The reason Fairbanks cites (for Wong apparently being difficult on set) is that the publicity guy got her Chinese name wrong — instead of “two yellow willows,” he said “two yellow widows.” The story to me just rang kind of phony, because I can’t imagine someone would get mad about something that sounds so silly.
     
            So not knowing what happened, I’m trying to think if I was Anna May Wong and I was 18 years old at the time, this is her big break. Douglas Fairbanks is one of the most famous people in Hollywood and the world. Everyone knew his film was going to be a huge blockbuster, and she had a very prominent role in it. So what would make her step away from the set and refuse to put her costume on?
     
            It had to be something pretty serious. To me, knowing her attitude already at that age towards the racism that she experienced, she was prepared to fight back. She wasn’t going to let people denigrate her in that way. So using circumstantial evidence, but also just understanding her position in that situation, my working theory is that someone made a racist comment to her, and she was like, “Well, I’m not gonna settle for this type of behavior, even in the most important film of my career.”
     
            That’s an example of how I tried to embody what her perspective might have been.
     
What’s the meaning behind the book’s title “Not Your China Doll”?
 
            When I started thinking about this book, I wanted to reframe the narrative around her life.
     
            So much of it is focused on the fact that she had to play stereotypes and the disappointment of not getting the lead role in “The Good Earth,” which would have potentially changed her career and her legacy in some people’s eyes. (Note: A White actor was cast as Chinese farmer Wang Lung, so Wong was ultimately passed over for the role of his wife O-Lan in favor of a White actress because of rules that outlawed the portrayal of interracial romance on screen.) 
 
            Also the fact that her later years were really difficult. She struggled with alcoholism. She struggled with the fact that she couldn’t play the same types of roles she did when she was young. The way that (her story) gets told makes her life sound like a tragedy and that she had no control over it.
     
        There’s a lot to what she did that has a certain defiance and righteousness to it.
     
 
            From my perspective, she had so much agency. She exerted so much resiliency and control over her future. There’s a lot to what she did that has a certain defiance and righteousness to it.
     
            “Not Your China Doll,” because she is always called the China doll, just felt appropriate. It’s not only a phrase that applies to Anna May Wong, but a lot of Asian American women feel that they’ve been objectified and exoticized in the same way.
     
Was there anything you learned about Wong during your research that surprised you?

            The thing that really impresses me still today is just how confident she was in herself and in her belief that she deserved more. She was always willing to fight for that. She did so in a very diplomatic and shrewd way — she didn’t outright complain, but she found other avenues to the thing that she wanted.
     
            Her decision to go to Europe in 1928 was a very difficult decision to make. To leave Hollywood was a really scary thing, because most people who did that didn’t come back in a successful way. She was only 23 at the time, and she says herself in one of her memoir pieces that many people told her not to do it. But then she says, “I just made up my mind that I would go.”
     
            I just love that confidence and that determination that whatever happened, she was going to make it work because she believed in herself. And honestly, if she hadn’t gone to Europe, I’m not sure that we would be talking about her today. That move really made her career.
     
One striking facet of Wong’s story is how everyone around her seemed to recognize her talent and star power, but she could never achieve her true potential because of how deeply racist Hollywood and the US overall were at the time. How did the country’s racial politics affect her career? 
 
            It’s hard for us to imagine how limited certain people were in how they could move through society. There’s a story that I just recently found where she was walking into a movie premiere and someone called her a “Chink” and said “Go back to where you came from” or “go back to the laundry.” But at the same time, because she was seen as a little bit more of an oddity, people were a little bit less in her face. She had much more mobility than she would if she had been a Black woman.
     
            There were also plenty of people who loved Anna May Wong and wanted to see more of her. It’s a very complex situation for movie studios then because they’re trying to tow a certain line. In the late 1920s, they had all these scandals, and they’re trying to clean things up and seem more appropriate. Part of that is limiting the types of roles that Anna May Wong can have.
     
            But at the same time, in the 1930s, there’s the Hays Code (a set of self-imposed guidelines on major film studios that prohibited nudity, miscegenation and other content), but they made exceptions all the time in other situations. So it was a code that was applied very selectively according to their whims.
     
            I do believe that at the end of the day, if producers and studio heads had wanted to make her an A-lister they would have, but they found excuses not to.
     
How does Wong’s legacy show up today? 
 
            So many Asian and Asian American actors in Hollywood today really look up to her as a source of strength and inspiration. (The landscape for Asian American actors) has definitely changed in a really good way in the last few years, but looking at her legacy is a reminder of the fact that we’ve had to wait 100 years for this type of progress. She was there from the very beginning, so why has it taken so long?
     
            It’s not that Asian Americans weren’t there. But the institution was built in such a way that it pushed them out.
     
        Anna May Wong was acting before the Oscars even existed.
     
 
            Watching Michelle Yeoh win the Oscar for Best Actress last year was such an emotional moment for me and for so many people. But I like to remind people that it took 95 years to get to that point. Anna May Wong was acting before the Oscars even existed.
     
What do you feel has changed about Hollywood since Wong’s time? What, if anything, has stayed the same?
 
            “Crazy Rich Asians” changed the game because it showed people that you could have a film that was led by an Asian cast that is commercially successful. Of course, there’s baggage that comes with that because then (studio heads) want a certain formula and they want it to always be “Crazy Rich Asians.” We want to tell a lot of different types of stories, not just ones like that.
     
            I do think that there has been a concerted effort among Asian Americans in the industry. There’s so many more people who are higher up in these organizations, whether they’re production companies or studios, who are helping to make decisions or advocating for these types of stories.
     
            The other reason really is just that there’s so much more opportunity now. You don’t have to go through Hollywood in order for your film to be successful and to reach an audience. You can fundraise, self-fund, produce it independently and hope it gets attention at a film festival.
     
            Watching “Everything Everywhere All At Once” — who would have thought that a film like that could win Best Picture at the Oscars? There’s so many more avenues now to make films and to tell stories that just weren’t available during her time.
     
Knowing what you know about Wong, how do you think she would feel about the plethora of Asian American stories on screen today?
 
            I think she would be so happy and over the moon to see what’s going on today. I almost think it’s beyond her wildest dreams. She was the only one, and now there are so many people in the Asian American cinematic universe.
     
            Hopefully, she would be an even bigger star. It’s hard to compare just because her acting style is a little bit different from what we’re used to today. But she was also a pretty fast study, so I think she’d figure out a way to be involved.
     
What films featuring Wong do you recommend?
 
            For her silent era, “Piccadilly” (1929) or “Pavement Butterfly (1929).
     
            “Shanghai Express” (1932) is a great one from the sound era with Marlene Dietrich. My only complaint is there’s not enough Anna May Wong in it.
     
        She was able to create a storyline where the Asian actors are the heroes and heroines.
     
 
            One other later film I would suggest would be “Daughter of Shanghai” (1937). It was a B-movie, but she had more influence over it so she was able to create a storyline where the Asian actors are the heroes and heroines and all the bad guys are played by White actors. And she gets a happy ending.  
 
What do you hope readers take away from Wong’s story?
 
            I’d like for readers to appreciate all of the things that she accomplished in her career, rather than dwelling on some of the more tragic things that happened.
     
            Yes, there were a lot of things that she had to struggle through. Despite it all, she really found a way to come out on top. The fact that she was weeks away from beginning rehearsals in “Flower Drum Song” (Note: Wong was originally cast as Madame Liang in the film adaptation of the 1958 Broadway musical but died shortly before production began), which would have been a huge milestone to have an all principal Asian cast, just tells you how far she went with her career.
     
            It’s a shame that she didn’t get to do it, but that doesn’t take away from the power of what she did.

Hong Kong’s legislature unanimously passed sweeping new powers on Tuesday that critics and analysts warned would align the financial hub’s national security laws more closely with those used on the Chinese mainland and deepen an ongoing crackdown on dissent.
     
            The lengthy national security bill – the first draft ran to 212 pages – was rushed through the city’s opposition-less Legislative Council with unusual haste at the request of city leader John Lee and debated over just 11 days.
     
            Coming into effect on Saturday, the law introduces 39 new national security crimes, adding to an already powerful national security law that was directly imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020 after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests the year before.
     
            That law has already transformed Hong Kong with authorities jailing dozens of political opponents, forcing civil society groups and outspoken media outlets to disband and transforming the once freewheeling city into one that prioritizes patriotism.
     
            Known locally as Article 23, the new national security legislation covers a raft of new crimes including treason, espionage, external interference and unlawful handling of state secrets, with the most serious offenses punishable by up to life imprisonment.
     
            Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Lee described it as a “historic moment for Hong Kong.”
     
            “We … have completed a historic mission, lived up to the trust of the country and did not let the Central government down,” he said, referring to China’s Communist Party leadership in Beijing.
     
            Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and top advisor to Lee, denied the swift passing of the law was “bowing to pressure from China.”
     
            “We have a legal, constitutional and moral responsibility to enact laws to safeguard national security,” she told CNN.
     
            China and Hong Kong’s leaders say the new laws are needed to “plug loopholes” as part of their drive to “restore stability” following the huge 2019 protests. They argue their legislation is similar to other national security laws around the world.
     
            Critics counter that what China’s Communist Party views as national security offences are far broader and more sweeping, often ensnaring political criticism, dissent and even business activity that would not be criminalized elsewhere.
     
            The new legislation also comes as Hong Kong’s government is embarking on a high-profile campaign this year to revive the city’s business credentials after the political crackdown – combined with nearly three years of strict coronavirus controls – sparked an exodus of local and international talent.
     
            Ip, the Hong Kong government advisor, insists the new legislation is “irrelevant to most people.”
     
            “It will really have no impact on large numbers of people, except those who are intent on endangering national security,” she said.
     
            But legal scholars and business figures told CNN that the broad definitions and grave penalties within the new law would likely result in further crackdown on civil society and could threaten the city’s once robust exchanges of information for businesses, including for its vaunted financial sector.
     
            “The Hong Kong authorities are eager to further tighten information control in the city as a corollary of stricter security legislation,” said Eric Lai, research fellow at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, and an expert on Hong Kong’s legal system.
     
            Lai expects a “chilling effect” to deepen across society.
     
            “The business community would be particularly affected by the new ‘theft of state secrets’ and ‘espionage’ offenses,” Lai added.
     
            The new legislation has outlawed “unlawful acquisition,” “possession,” and “disclosure of state secrets,” alongside the crime of “espionage.” Offenders can be jailed for up to 20 years in the most serious circumstance.
     
            Observers say the law’s wording has a broad interpretation for what counts as a state secret.

            The definition ranges from a secret “concerning the construction of national defense” and “diplomatic or foreign affair activities” of China to any “major policy decision on affairs” and “the economic or social development” of both Beijing and Hong Kong.
     
            Hung Ho-fung, sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, said that when social and economic affairs are treated as state secrets, “this is to say it can include anything.”
     
            “With these draconian and not clearly defined clauses, even apolitical business persons can get into trouble and will face the risk of their office being raided and themselves being detained, arrested or placed under exit ban as in many cases in mainland China,” he said.
     
            “This will surely increase the doubt, anxiety, and uncertainty of foreign businesses in Hong Kong.”
     
            The US State Department said the new law had “the potential to accelerate the closing of Hong Kong’s once open society” and it was analyzing what the potential risk could be to US citizens and “other American interests.”
     
            “We’re alarmed by the sweeping and what we interpret as vaguely-defined provisions laid out in their Article 23 legislation,” State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told a press briefing.
     
            Patel pointed out a number of issues with the law, such as being “fast tracked through the non-democratically elected legislative council after a truncated public comment period” and having terminology that is “poorly defined and incredibly vague.”
     
            The European Union also said it was concerned about the legislation’s impact on the “rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.”
     
            “The bill’s sweeping provisions and broad definitions, specifically in relation to foreign interference and state secrets, appear as particular concerns,” it said in a statement. “The significantly increased penalties provided for in the Bill, its extraterritorial reach and its - at least partial - retroactive applicability are also deeply worrying.”
     
            British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the new law was “rushed through the legislative process” and it would have far-reaching implications for Hong Kong’s rule of law, rights and freedoms.
     
            At a news conference Wednesday, China’s Foreign Ministry expressed its “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” over what it called “vilification of Hong Kong’s national security regulations by certain countries and organizations.”
     
            The new law will help Hong Kong “balance development and security, better leverage Hong Kong’s unique status and advantages, and deepen open and closer exchanges and cooperation with other countries and regions,” said ministry spokesperson Lin Jian.
     
            In mainland China, national security laws have often ensnared both local and foreign businesses in opaque investigations.
     
            China’s state security authorities raided multiple offices of international advisory firm Capvision last year, part of a broader crackdown on the consulting industry as Beijing tightens control over what it considers sensitive information related to national security.
     
            The law also labels the involvement of “external forces” – a byword for foreign governments and organizations – as an aggravating factor that warrants tougher sentencing.
     
            Amnesty International China director Sarah Brooks said the leg﻿islation “delivered another crushing blow to human rights in the city.”
     
            “The authorities have enacted this law in the blink of an eye, killing off any remaining shred of hope that public outcry could counter its most destructive elements,” Brooks said in a statement. “This is a devastating moment for the people of Hong Kong.”
     
            Johannes Hack, the President of the German Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said while many German businesses remain committed to Hong Kong, they would like to see Hong Kong maintain its unique position that includes free flow of capital and a common law court system.
     
            “[The law] is making it a bit hard to make the case for our German shareholders that this is Hong Kong and this is different from mainland China,” he said.
     
            That is something Emily Lau, a former pro-democracy lawmaker, also worries about, that what made Hong Kong distinct is fast fading.
     
            “We want Hong Kong to prosper, we are part of China. I’ve never disputed that,” she told CNN.
     
            “But we are different from the rest of China. But the difference is getting less and less, which is very sad.”

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday reiterated the United States’ “ironclad commitment” to defend the Philippines as rising tensions with China in the South China Sea raise fears of a broader regional conflict.
     
            Stability in the region is seen as being increasingly threatened by clashes between Chinese coast guard and maritime militia units and Philippine vessels around disputed features in the waterway. In the most recent confrontation two weeks ago, a Chinese coast guard vessel used a water cannon against a Philippine boat, shattering its glass panel and injuring four Filipino sailors.
     
            Speaking at a joint news conference with his Philippine counterpart in Manila, Blinken said the allies “have a shared concern about the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) actions that threaten our common vision for a free, open Indo-Pacific, including in the South China Sea and in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.”
     
            “Repeated violations of international law and the rights of the Philippines – water cannons, blocking maneuvers, close shadowing, other dangerous operations – these waterways are critical to the Philippines, to its security, to its economy, but they’re also critical to the interests of the region, the United States, and the world,” he said.
     
            The US military maintains a regular presence in the South China Sea, with aircraft overflights, so-called freedom of navigation operations, and patrols and exercises with allies and partners to assert that the sea is an international waterway.
     
            Blinken said a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951, under which Washington is bound to defend Manila from attack, is “ironclad” and “extends to armed attacks on the Filipino armed forces, public vessels, aircraft – including those of its coast guard – anywhere in the South China Sea.”
     
            “Most important is we stand together in our determination to uphold international law – for the Philippines, for everyone else – against any provocative actions,” he said.
     
            The “extraordinary expansion” of ties between the US and the Philippines had been in “hyperdrive” in recent months, Blinken said. But the closer partnership was not aimed at any country, the top US diplomat and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo insisted.

            The Philippine official also stressed that Manila aimed to resolve disputes through peaceful diplomacy.
     
            “The Philippines has always maintained the policy of addressing any disputes and managing them through diplomatic means and through peaceful means, and we are still committed to that,” Manalo said.
     
            China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all 1.3 million square miles of the resource-rich South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling to the contrary by an international tribunal in The Hague.
     
            “The US is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to interfere in the maritime issues between China and the Philippines,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said in a regular press conference Tuesday.
     
            Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has openly aligned with the US since winning power in 2022 in a shift from his predecessor’s closer relationship with Beijing – and has taken a stronger line on criticizing China’s actions in the South China Sea.
     
            Tuesday marked Blinken’s second visit to Manila since Marcos took office, and comes weeks before President Joe Biden is set to host the Philippine president and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a White House summit in April.
     
            Blinken described the upcoming summit as a “new horizon of cooperation” that is “incredibly promising,” in remarks before he met with Marcos on Tuesday.
     
            “It’s building on the very strong foundation between our countries, where we have the same priorities, whether it’s economic development, whether it’s dealing with climate change, with food security, of course upholding international law – all of these things are front and center,” Blinken said.
     
            In a statement Monday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the three leaders “will discuss trilateral cooperation to promote inclusive economic growth and emerging technologies, advance clean energy supply chains and climate cooperation, and further peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.”

            Chinese regulators have accused Evergrande and its founder of inflating revenues by $78 billion, putting the insolvent property developer at the heart of the country’s biggest ever financial fraud case.
     
            The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) slapped a penalty of 4.175 billion yuan ($580 million) on Hengda Real Estate, the group’s main Chinese unit, the company said in filings to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Monday.
     
Xu Jiayin, founder and chairman of the Evergrande Group, was fined 47 million yuan ($6.5 million) for the overstatement and other alleged violations. Formerly China’s richest man, he was also barred from the securities markets for life.
     
            The findings were revealed after an eight-month-long investigation by the CSRC.
     
            The investigation had previously derailed Evergrande’s debt restructuring talks with its overseas bondholders in the fall, because the company couldn’t issue new notes, according to a company statement issued in September.
     
            Days later, Evergrande said its chairman had been detained by Chinese authorities on suspicion of “crimes.” In January 2024, a Hong Kong court ordered Evergrande to liquidate.
     
            In Monday’s filing, Hengda said the CSRC accused the company of several violations, including inflating sales in its financial reports, relying on these allegedly falsified figures to sell bonds and failing to disclose relevant information as required.

            The regulator said Hengda had fabricated 214 billion yuan ($30 billion) in sales for 2019, which accounted for half of that year’s revenue. Another 350 billion yuan ($48.6 billion) in sales for 2020, accounting for 78% of revenue, were also falsified. 
 
            As a result, 2019’s net profit was inflated by 63% and 2020’s net profit by 87%, it said.
     
            The alleged fraud, amounting to a total of 564.1 billion yuan ($78 billion) over two years, is the largest ever financial fraud case in mainland China’s securities markets, according to previous regulatory statements and state media reports.
     
            In addition to the penalties levied on Hengda and Xu, six other executives were fined by the CSRC for being “directly responsible.”
     
            Like Xu, Xia Haijun, the former vice chairman and CEO of Evergrande Group, was banned from the nation’s securities markets for life.
     
            “Xu Jiayin had made decisions, organized, and implemented the financial fraud … Xia Haijun had organized, arranged and prepared the falsified financial reports… their means were really bad and the circumstances were grave,” the regulator said.

            For more than a decade, Lee has been able to circumvent China’s internet controls to go on Twitter, now known as X, without getting into trouble with the authorities.
     
            The Chinese lawyer stayed away from politically sensitive topics and rarely engaged with other users, treating the platform mainly as an archive to back up his postings on heavily censored Chinese social media.
     
            He has continued tweeting even as Beijing intensifies efforts to control free speech beyond its Great Firewall of internet censorship, interrogating, detaining and jailing Chinese Twitter users who criticize leader Xi Jinping and his government.
     
            Last month, in a sign of the widening crackdown on foreign social media sites, Lee too was summoned by police – not because of what he tweeted, but because of who he followed.
     
            In an early-morning phone call, an officer invited Lee to “have tea” – a euphemism for police questioning – to talk about the “sensitive accounts” he followed on X.
     
            At the police station, it became clear that the officer had only one target in mind: an outspoken and unfiltered Chinese-language X account with a cat avatar and 1.6 million followers whose handle translates to “Teacher Li is not your teacher.”
     
            “The police asked me if I followed the account ‘Teacher Li is not your teacher,’ but I honestly didn’t know,” Lee said in an interview. He logged into X under the watch of the officer, found the account and unfollowed it on the spot, he said.

            That account belongs to Li Ying, a Chinese artist turned dissident in Italy who rose to prominence in 2022 for live-tweeting the nationwide protests in China against Xi’s zero-Covid policy.
     
            Since then, Li’s account has become a go-to source for news censored in China. His followers send him photos and videos from Chinese social media before they are wiped by censors, and Li reposts them on X, offering a rare and unflinching glimpse into aspects of Chinese life that Beijing doesn’t want the world – or its own citizens – to see.
     
            Li’s X feed documents everything from school scandals and factory fires to protests by migrant workers demanding overdue wages – creating a parallel world to the sanitized version of reality presented by the Chinese government.
     
            For more than a year, authorities have tried in vain to pressure Li into silence: paying frequent visits to his parents, interrogating his friends, classmates and contacts on Chinese social media, and freezing his bank accounts and mobile payments, he said.
     
            The 31-year-old quit his job and moved four times over concerns for his safety, but he has carried on tweeting.
     
            And now, Chinese authorities appear to be going after his followers in China.
     
            The escalating campaign against one of the most influential Chinese accounts on X comes as Washington becomes increasingly wary of Beijing’s reach in cyberspace beyond its borders. On Wednesday, the US House passed a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on Chinese-owned app TikTok over national security concerns.
     
            X, like Facebook and other Western social media platforms, is blocked in China. But a small number of Chinese people – typically city dwellers who are more educated and tech savvy – still access it via virtual private networks to keep up with the world beyond the Great Firewall.
     
            Like elsewhere on the platform since its takeover by Elon Musk, Chinese-language X is increasingly filled with misinformation, propaganda and pornography. But for Chinese speakers inside and outside the country, it still provides a valuable space to air political dissent, discuss social issues and – increasingly with accounts like Li’s – find out what’s really going on in the country of 1.4 billion people.
     
            Li’s popularity has surged since China’s protests against Covid lockdowns, and his follower count doubled in the following year.
     
            But on February 25, Li warned his readers in China that the Ministry of Public Security was going through his 1.6 million followers “one by one,” and local police were summoning users to “have tea” once they were identified.
     
            “I suggest anyone who feels scared to just unfollow me, you can bookmark one of my tweets or search my account name to read about the day’s news in the future,” Li wrote in an “emergent notice” on X.
     
            He also urged users to better protect their accounts, so as not to give away their identity. Under the post, Li shared screenshots of private messages he received from followers who said they were interrogated by police.

            CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Public Security for comment.
     
            Li’s warnings sent shock waves through the small but influential Chinese X sphere. In just a few days, he lost some 200,000 followers. Other prominent Chinese dissidents and activists on the platform reported a plunge in follower counts, too. The panic also spread to YouTube, an important source of income for many exiled dissidents, including Li.
     
            “I certainly knew it would cause some panic, but I didn’t expect the panic to reach such an extent,” Li said. “It shows that fear is more deeply rooted in our hearts than freedom.”
     
            Li said he issued the warning because police harassment of his followers had intensified drastically in recent months. From December, he had received messages from more than 100 followers across China who said they had been summoned by police over his account.
     
            Many of the followers facing interrogation had never tweeted about politics or criticized the government, and the only question the police had for them was why they followed Li, he said.
     
            Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House, said police interrogations for merely following an X account is an escalation from the past, when X users were usually targeted for expressing their own views.
     
            “To the authorities, following a certain account means that you are thinking of the wrong things in your head and should be punished, in other words, committing ‘thought crimes,’” she said. “This is a clear sign of the Chinese government’s further tightening control of freedom of expression in the country.”
     
            According to Li, the police summons ramped up after China’s former premier, Li Keqiang, died of a sudden heart attack at age 68, just months after his retirement.
     
            Li Keqiang’s death sparked nationwide mourning. For many, it also offered a rare opening to air pent-up discontent with Xi, the supreme leader widely seen as having sidelined his former premier.
     
            On X, Li Ying’s account provided a window into the outpouring of grief and disaffection. Followers sent him photos of the flowers and notes left in tribute to the late premier in public spaces across the country. Some users said they were encouraged to act after seeing the posts on Li’s account.

            “(The authorities) were upset that I had so many posts about people mourning across China. That was something they were trying to underplay in mainstream media and hide from the public,” he said.
     
            Li said his account was targeted for a simple reason: it documents what’s happening in China.
     
            “Within China, the authorities have many ways to make things disappear in a heartbeat, be it a fire or a highway accident,” he said. “But once it’s posted here, it’ll be seen by many more people and sometimes make its way back into the Chinese internet. This is something out of the government’s control.”
     
            Wang, the researcher at Freedom House, said that, amid rising discontent at political repression, the slowing economy and other societal issues, more Chinese people want to know the truth about their country and are taking the risks to scale the Great Firewall to access free information.
     
            “Beijing is growing increasingly insecure about its hold onto Chinese people ideologically and fearful of ‘foreign influence’ on people inside the country,” she said.
     
            The widening clampdown is a sign of weakness, not strength, of the party-state, and a reflection of the power individual activists wield, Wang said.

            “The Chinese authorities are fearful of young people like Teacher Li, seeing him as a threat to its rule,” Wang said.
     
            “People often say that activism and political mobilization is not possible in China given the level of government repression, but Chinese activists are constantly adapting and finding new ways to express dissent and forge a resistance movement.”
     
            Lee, the Chinese lawyer who was questioned by authorities, said he knew little about Li’s backstory or his role in the anti-zero-Covid protests prior to the police station visit – he only came across the account because it posted so much news from China.
     
            “Teacher Li’s content tells the truth. He’s one of the few accounts on X who don’t talk nonsense,” he said.
     
            According to Lee, the police officer remained “polite and civil” with him throughout the questioning, which lasted less than half an hour.
     
            “I didn’t feel any sense of fear because I’ve done nothing bad or wrong,” he said. “And I followed Teacher Li right back the moment I stepped out of the door.”

            For leaders across the West, Vladimir Putin’s inevitable landslide win in an election without true opposition was a reminder of his tight control over Russia’s political arena as his war against Ukraine grinds on.
     
            But Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and other leaders benefiting from Putin’s rejection of a Western-led global order, will be cheering his victory.
     
            With 99.8% of ballots counted, Putin amassed 87.3% of the vote, according to preliminary results reported Monday morning by Russia’s Central Election Commission.
     
            Xi congratulated the Russian leader in a call that day, saying his re-election “fully reflected the support of the Russian people,” Chinese state media reported. He also pledged that China would promote the “sustained” and “in-depth” development of the two countries’ strategic partnership, the report said.
     
            Xi has staked much on his relationship with Putin since the start of the Kremlin’s war more than two years ago, refusing to back away from the “no limits” partnership he declared with the Russian leader weeks before the invasion, while strengthening trade, security, and diplomatic ties.
     
            China has paid a price for this. While it claims neutrality, its refusal to condemn the invasion as the US and its allies united to sanction Russia piqued European suspicion about its motivations. It also drew attention to Beijing’s designs on the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan. An annual NATO report released Thursday reflected the bloc’s hardening line on China, with chief Jens Stoltenberg saying Beijing does “not share our values” and “challenges our interests,” while pointing to its increasing alignment with Moscow.
     
            But China’s stance enabled Xi to stay focused on deeper goals: he sees Putin as a crucial partner in the face of rising tensions with the US and in reshaping a world he believes is unfairly dominated by rules and values set by Washington and its allies. A stable relationship with Moscow, too, allows Beijing to focus on other areas of concern such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.
     
            “Xi sees Putin as a genuine strategic partner,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, ahead of the Russian election results, adding that anything less than a landslide win for Putin would be “a disappointment” for Beijing.
     
            Xi, who has centralized control over his own nation like no Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, won’t be alone among leaders applauding Putin’s renewed grip on power.
     
            Kim Jong Un of North Korea recently met Putin in Russia’s Far East during a rare overseas trip that Washington says focused on Moscow buying munitions from Pyongyang.
     
            For Kim, that tightening bond is a major opportunity to strengthen his struggling economy as he continues weapons development in the face of increased coordination between the US and South Korea. The North Korean leader swiftly congratulated Putin on his win Monday, according to the country’s state media.
     
            A sanctions-battered government in Iran, which has been expanding its cooperation with Russia and providing it with drones and ammunition, also gains from a continuation of the Putin era.
     
            Even India, while tightening ties with the US and calling for peace in Ukraine, has benefited from continuing exchanges with Russia, especially through its purchase of discounted oil.
     
            Other governments across the Global South have also looked to bolster partnerships with Russia, even as they back peace in Ukraine and have suffered from knock-on economic impacts of the war.
     
            While the Russian election was no contest, Putin’s ability to maintain his iron grip on power and reach this point without a defeat in Ukraine has not been a sure bet.
     
            The Russian leader has weathered an apparent miscalculation that what his government still calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine would be a swift success. He faced a challenge from the late warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin who launched a brief but failed rebellion, and Western sanctions that severed Russia’s economy from much of the global market.
     
            In response he’s ramped up repression and further quashed dissent across the country – including from the Kremlin’s most charismatic and prominent domestic critic Alexey Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month.
     
            Now, as he emerges poised to carry on for at least another six years, Putin presides over an economy that’s surviving sanctions and a battlefield where his opponent has yet to see a decisive breakthrough. Meanwhile, there are nascent signs of fatigue, in particular from the United States, where a presidential election in November could upend American support for Ukraine.

China has a sweeping vision to reshape the world – and countries are listening
 
            Much could still change in the war. But for countries that remained close to Putin or avoided US-led efforts to isolate him, his win ensures the stability of their Russia ties – and of a rising grouping of vehicles for non-Western alignment.
     
            Russia is set to host an annual summit of the BRICS grouping of major developing economies as its chair this year. The group, since 2011 made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, almost doubled in size at the start of this year to also include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Egypt.
     
            BRICS is seen as developing countries’ answer to the G7, and its scheduled October summit in Russia’s Kazan will likely underline the stark difference between the two group’s sensibilities. In 2014, G7 countries ousted Russia from what was then a G8 after its 2014 invasion of Crimea, and bailed on its planned summit that year in Sochi.
     
            There is a range of reasons why Putin is seen differently in some parts of the world than in the West: the rise of middle powers that resent US domination of international affairs; the itch for a world order that doesn’t look down on authoritarians or repressive states; or pure economic practicality for economies striving to develop.
     
            US support for Israel, especially amid the ongoing devastation in Gaza, has been a key alienation point for many of these nations and China’s prominent criticism of how Palestinians are treated has resonated across much of the Global South.
     
            Putin, for his part, has painted BRICS as part of a growing movement eclipsing the established order, including in terms of economic heft.
     
            “There is no getting away from this objective reality, and it will remain that way no matter what happens next, including even in Ukraine,” he said during his state of the union address late last month.
     
            Then he underscored a view he’ll likely want both friend and foe to consider as he enters his new term: “No enduring international order is possible without a strong and sovereign Russia.”
     
            But that doesn’t mean countries tied to Moscow aren’t also watching the conflict in Ukraine carefully. That may be especially true for China, Russia’s most powerful strategic partner.
     
            Chinese state media credulously reported the election results Monday with official news agency Xinhua highlighting Putin’s promise to continue to promote “national development,” while another state media headline hailed Russia’s “steadily advancing political process.”
     
            Coverage also noted Putin’s comments on China made during a news conference Sunday night, where he pointed to the “coinciding of state interests” between the two countries and reiterated his backing of Beijing’s claim over the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan.
     
            China has reaped significant benefit from the war and stands to continue doing so – as long as it doesn’t trend toward a Russian defeat.
     
            Chinese buyers lapped up record levels of Moscow’s crude oil in 2023, while exports of items such as cars and household electronics to Russia expanded since the invasion, buoying trade to a record high and boosting Chinese yuan-denominated transactions.

Putin says he’s ready to use nuclear weapons if Russian state at stake, but ‘there has never been such a need’
 
            Xi has used the war in Ukraine as a platform to pitch his own, albeit vague, alternative system for global security, while a diluted focus of the US government is good news for China.
     
            Beijing, however, says it is working “tirelessly” to bring the conflict to a close as it seeks to carve out an image as peacemaker. It sent special envoy for Eurasia Li Hui on two tours to Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Europe to promote a negotiated end to the conflict, the second of which concluded last week.
     
            Chinese foreign policy thinkers such as Wang Yiwei of Renmin University say Beijing is concerned about nuclear escalation – a threat recently raised again by Putin – and the potential for more European countries to become directly involved in the war. “How to avoid escalating the conflict … that’s Li Hui’s special concern this time,” he told CNN.
     
            But Li, a former ambassador to Russia, and other Chinese officials are seen in much of Europe as merely presenting a plan whose outcome would benefit Putin. That’s in line with European views on Beijing’s stance since the war’s opening days, when it insisted that all sides’ “legitimate security concerns” must be resolved.
     
            For now, as pressure from across the world to end the conflict grows, the foregone results of this weekend’s Russian election will likely only bolster the view in Beijing – and some other non-Western capitals – that they were right to back Putin.

            China’s key real estate sector hasn’t shown much improvement following a flurry of government measures taken to boost the industry, even as other parts of the economy seem to be stabilizing.
     
            New property sales reached a total of 1.06 trillion yuan ($147 billion) in the first two months of this year, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. That’s equivalent to a fall of 29.3% compared to the same period in 2023.
     
            The drop also marks a much faster pace of decline from the year-ago period, when new property sales dipped just 0.1%.
     
            Property investment fell 9% in the January-to-February period, which was faster than the 5.7% decrease registered during the same period last year.
     
            “The correction in property construction is still in its early stages,” Capital Economics analysts said in a research note on Monday. “We expect it [property construction] to halve in the coming years, pulling down economic growth over the medium-term.”

            However, other parts of the economy — including consumption, industrial production and infrastructure investment — appear to show improvement thanks to a holiday spending boom, strong exports and state-led infrastructure push.
     
            Retail sales increased 5.5% in January-February from the same period a year earlier, which was slightly higher than an expected 5.2% increase from a Reuters poll of analysts.
     
            Catering services, telecoms, cigarettes and tobacco, and sports and entertainment services registered the highest growth in sales.
     
            But it is still uncertain if the improvement will continue. “Consumers were buoyed temporarily by festivities-related spending at this start of the year,” said Louise Loo, China economist at Oxford Economics.
     
            Industrial output jumped 7% during the first two months of this year from the same period in 2023, beating the 5% growth forecast in the Reuters poll.
     
            That’s in line with the strong Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index released by S&P Global earlier this month. The index, which focuses on export-oriented manufacturing firms in mainland China, rose to 50.9 in February, up from 50.8 in January, marking a fourth straight month of expansion.
     
            The growth in factory output might be driven by strong exports demand. Separate customs figures showed that China’s exports jumped 7.1% in the January-to-February period from a year ago, well above market expectations.

            Investment in fixed assets — such as factories, roads, and power grids — increased 4.2% in the first two months of this year, surpassing analyst estimates.
     
            This is mainly driven by state-led investment, the NBS data showed.
     
            Still, the property downturn and weak domestic demand call for more policy support to sustain growth.
     
            “In the absence of decisive consumption-related stimulus this year, we think it would be difficult to sustain a robust consumer spending pace,” Loo said.
     
            Some of the government’s new initiatives to spur consumer spending — including the replacement of old durable goods, such as cars and home appliances, with new ones— would be “hugely beneficial,” she added.
     
            “Economic outlook in [the second quarter] is still quite uncertain,” said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
     
            “While exports helped to partially offset the weak domestic momentum [at the start of the year], a sustainable recovery requires more policy support, particularly from the fiscal side,” he said.

            TikTok is now facing a ban in the United States, a fate that has already befallen a string of American social media giants that tried to make it in China.
     
            On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill which could ban TikTok in the country if its Chinese owner ByteDance doesn’t sell the app to an entity that satisfies the US government.
     
            “The bill passed by the US House of Representatives puts the US on the opposite side of the principle of fair competition and international economic and trade rules,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a briefing Thursday.
     
            But American apps have long been barred in China. Beijing currently blocks most US social media platforms — including Google, YouTube, X, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook — because they refuse to follow the Chinese government’s rules on data collection and the type of content shared.
     
            In 2010, Google pulled out from mainland China after operating there for four years. It said at the time that it was no longer willing to continue censoring results on Google.cn, citing Chinese-originated hacks on it and other US companies.
     
            More than 10 years after that high-profile retreat, the shoe is on the other foot, even if the circumstances aren’t exactly the same.
     
            “The TikTok bill appears likely to become law and China’s displeasure seems ironic, if not hypocritical, given its stance toward American social apps,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at Kaiyuan Capital.
     
            Asked about China’s stance on US apps, Wang said “this is completely different” and “you can clearly see what is bullying and what is gangster logic.”
     
            The focus is now on the US Senate, where many lawmakers said they are still evaluating the legislation. President Joe Biden has said he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk.
     
            US officials and legislators have long expressed concerns about TikTok’s potential national security risks, including that it could share data with the Chinese government, or manipulate content displayed on the platform. But TikTok has rejected the claims.
     
            On Thursday, following the House vote, the Chinese Commerce Ministry pledged that the country would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard its interests regarding TikTok.
     
            The Chinese government has said it strongly opposes a forced sale of TikTok, and it has the legal ability to do so. It views TikTok’s technology as highly valuable and has taken steps since 2020 to ensure it can veto any sale by ByteDance.
     
            In August 2020, following an attempt by the Trump administration to force the sale of TikTok, Beijing revised its export control rules to cover a variety of technologies it deemed sensitive, including technology that appears similar to TikTok’s personalized information recommendation services.
     
            Years later, in March 2023, a Commerce Ministry spokeswoman said in the government’s first direct response to the matter that China would oppose any forced sale of TikTok, because a sale or divestiture of the app would involve exporting technology and had to be approved by the Chinese government. Beijing has not indicated any change to this position since then.
     
            TikTok’s algorithms, which keep users glued to the app, are believed to be key to its success. The algorithms give recommendations based on users’ behavior, thus pushing videos they actually like and want to watch.
     
            “TikTok’s crown jewel, its AI algorithms, will put the company into a legal tug of war,” said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at New York University School of Law, adding that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to seek Beijing’s approval before selling advanced technologies.
     
            Silvers said it was possible that TikTok could seek a “middle ground” to try to meet US requirements for ownership, but it’s unclear whether American concerns can be mollified by cosmetic change.
     
            He said the episode is likely to worsen relations between Beijing and Washington, which are already mired in an escalating battle over access to advanced technology such as computer chips and AI.
     
            “Markets should expect [China to have] retaliatory actions against US firms as tech and trade issues continue on a negative trajectory,” he said.
     
            If TikTok is eventually banned, more Chinese-owned apps in the US may be next in line, according to Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a lecturer at the National University of Singapore Business School.
     
            “This latest episode with TikTok underscores the need for a much more robust regulatory framework in the US to address existential issues wrought by big-tech, in general,” he said.
     
            Applications from Chinese developers popular in the US App Store or Google Play include budget retailers Temu and Shein, as well as short-form video editing app Capcut, which is also owned by ByteDance.
     
            “This legislation marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle for control over emerging public opinion spaces, deepening the geopolitical contest between China and the US,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, DC.
     
            On Chinese social media site Weibo, hashtags related to TikTok being potentially banned in the US were trending on Thursday, generating 78 million views and thousands of discussion posts.
     
            “Why can’t we just talk about business instead of elevating everything to the national [security] level?” said Weibo user “Mastering technology” in a post that was ranked “hot” by the platform. “Direct interference in business operations is inconsistent with the values of free market economy that the US has always advocated.”
     
            “This is the US version of nationalism,” another user wrote.
     
            Some online commentators urged Beijing to retaliate by taking action against US companies operating in China. But that was questioned by other users.
     
            “We’ve already been unable to use Google, Twitter, and Facebook for more than a decade,” said one user. “I think we are way ahead of the US in blocking foreign news media [services].”
     
            Capri said the saga exposes the “ironies and inequalities” of US-China commercial exchange.
     
            “While China has completely banned [these] American apps, TikTok enjoys all the benefits of America’s free and open legal and political systems,” he said.

            For many of the 170 million TikTok users in the United States, Wednesday’s vote in the House of Representatives to effectively ban the social media platform is worrisome. But the overwhelming — bipartisan even — decision to push forward a bill aimed at forcing ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell the social media app, shows how deep concerns run. The fact that it happened despite opposition from former President Donald Trump makes the moment even more remarkable.
     
            The House bill would give ByteDance five months to divest, or it would ban app stores from offering it in the country. It’s unclear if the Senate will take up the bill, but it already tried a similar one last year, and Senators from both parties were impressed with the extent of bipartisanship in the House vote.
     
National security officials say TikTok could become a threat. But a look at TikTok’s feeds strongly suggests it already is far from a neutral player, aggravating divisions in the US and apparently trying to conceal posts on topics about which the Chinese government prefers silence. (A practice TikTok has denied).
     
            Congress is right in wanting to curtail China’s ability to use TikTok to scoop up Americans’ private information and, more importantly, to influence views and opinions in a country that it views as its primary geopolitical rival.
     
            Some headlines claim Congress wants to ban the app, and that’s what TikTok is telling users, mobilizing them to call Washington and pressure their representatives to reject the bill. But the flood of calls only added to the image of TikTok as an entity that can be used to manipulate Americans.
     
            The number of Americans who get their news from TikTok is skyrocketing, according to the Pew Research Center. From 2020 to 2023, it quadrupled to 14%. And almost a third of adults under 30 say they regularly get their news from the app.
     
            At a time like this, with Americans more deeply divided than ever, tensions running high with a pivotal election approaching and after the experience of 2020 and especially 2016, when Russia used social media to turn Americans against each other, leaving TikTok at Beijing’s disposal would amount to governmental dereliction of duty.
     
            Under a 2017 Chinese intelligence law, Chinese authorities have full power to seize any information from Chinese companies and use those firms for their own purposes. TikTok CEO Shou Chew insists the company is independent of the government, claiming Beijing has never asked for US user data and maintaining that it wouldn’t comply if asked. Real life suggests otherwise.

            The repressive Chinese government has made it almost routine to make powerful business leaders “disappear” if they offer even mild complaints about government policy. Some of them reappear after long periods, chastened and determined to toe the line. The cases of Chinese tycoons Jack Ma — who disappeared for months — and Xiao Jianhua, who was sent to prison following his reappearance after vanishing, shocked the global business community.
     
            That’s just one reason why it’s laughable to hear China’s foreign ministry claim that the TikTok bill would disrupt market operations and undermine investor confidence.
     
            Most of the world’s most popular social media apps, incidentally, are banned in China unless they — or their user data — are locally based and thus easily overseen by the government. There’s no Facebook in China, no Instagram, WhatsApp or X.
     
            Trying to save itself, TikTok has moved American users’ data to Oracle-controlled servers. But the all-powerful algorithm remains out of reach.
     
            On Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said before Congress that the US “cannot rule out” the possibility that Beijing will use TikTok to influence the 2024 election. The US Annual Threat Assessment warned that in 2022 the Chinese government used TikTok accounts to target candidates of both parties. China denies it all and a US intelligence official told CNN there’s no evidence they’re doing it now, but it’s naive to think the manipulation is not already underway.
     
            In recent months, TikTok has already added to political tensions in the US. A Wall Street Journal analysis found TikTok served a steady diet of the most extreme views on both sides of the Israel-Hamas war, stoking fear and anger, with posts such as one claiming that the US “has decided to exterminate all Arab countries.”
     
            On the US economy, videos falsely claiming that the US — which is enjoying historical low unemployment — is experiencing a “Silent Depression” gained traction on TikTok. Analysts at Rutgers University found that TikTok appears to thwart videos about Tibet, the Uyghurs, the Hong Kong protests and the Tiananmen Square massacre, all topics that reveal the intensity of China’s repression.
     
            In response to the analyses, TikTok quietly disabled the tool used to measure trends on the app.
     
        Wednesday’s vote was a rare show of unity in a divided Washington. The bill passed by a wide margin – 352 to 65.

            Wednesday’s vote was a rare show of unity in a divided Washington. The bill passed by a wide margin — 352 to 65.
     
            But perhaps more remarkable was the rebuke of former President Trump by his own party. Only 15 of 219 Republicansin Congress rejected the bill, which Trump opposed.
     
            Trump’s position now is a neck-wrenching reversal. “As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States!” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in July 2020. At the time, he was battling China not only on trade issues but on Covid, seeking to put the spotlight on the country in connection with the pandemic.
     
            Concerns about TikTok’s ability to sweep up data from millions of Americans were already high on the national security agenda. Trump was so adamant against the app that he even opposed a potential deal for Microsoft to buy TikTok.
     
            But now, Trump has reversed course and he opposes the bill. He claims it would only help Facebook, which he has labeled an “enemy of the people,” a favorite phrase he’s borrowed from the Stalinist purges in the USSR.
     
            It’s impossible to know with full certainty what motivates Trump’s shift. But it’s worth asking if it has something to do with Republican billionaire Jeff Yass, a mega-donor who owns a slice of ByteDance and has hired former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway to lobby against the bill. She has had multiple meetings with legislators and has spoken with Trump about protecting TikTok, according to the Washington Post.
     
            Could Trump also be influenced by a propaganda film produced by the far-right group Citizens United, which blamed Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg for  his election loss in 2020?
     
            Defying Trump is a notable move for today’s congressional Republicans. It shows that concerns about TikTok have reached a critical mass. It’s unclear how far this legislation will go and at what speed.
     
            What is beyond doubt is that social media has become such a powerful force that curtailing TikTok’s ability to harm the country should be only the first step, even if it makes users uneasy.
     
            The government needs to develop oversight rules for all social media. Leaving the companies to police themselves is only worsening the country’s ills.

            China has described a potential TikTok ban as “an act of bullying” that would backfire on America.
     
            The comments, made by China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday, came hours before a House of Representatives vote on legislation that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the popular short video app to an American company — or face being barred in the US, where it boasts over 170 million users.
     
            “Even though the US has not found evidence on how TikTok endangers its national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok,” Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the ministry, told CNN Wednesday at a news conference in Beijing.
     
            Wang accused the US of “resorting to acts of bullying” when it could not succeed in fair competition, saying such practice would disrupt market operations, undermine investor confidence and sabotage the global economic order.
     
            “This will eventually backfire on the US itself,” he said.
     
            US officials and lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could compel TikTok’s parent ByteDance to hand over data collected from US users. They also fear that the app could serve as a tool for Beijing to spread propaganda, misinformation or influence Americans.
     
            Cybersecurity experts say that the national security concerns surrounding TikTok remain a hypothetical — albeit troubling — scenario. US officials have not publicly presented evidence that the Chinese government has accessed the user data of US TikTok users, an outcome that lawmakers say their bill is intended to prevent.

TikTok ban: How each member of the House voted
 
            The House vote will proceed under fast-track rules that require a two-third majority for passage — which appears likely given widespread bipartisan support. The bill will then head to the Senate, where its fate is less certain.
     
            In recent comments to reporters, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, who chairs a House select committee on China, rejected characterizations of the bill as a TikTok ban.
     
            “It’s not a ban,” he said. “It puts the choice squarely in the hands of TikTok to sever their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. As long as ByteDance no longer owns the company, TikTok can continue to survive … the basic ownership structure has to change.”
     
            China has previously said it would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok.
     
            “The sale or divestiture of TikTok involves technology export, and administrative licensing procedures must be performed in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations,” a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry said in March last year.
     
            “The Chinese government will make a decision in accordance with the law.”
     
            On Chinese social media site Weibo, Tiktok was ranked among the top trending topics on Wednesday, with the hashtag “Tiktok starts to fight back” drawing 80 million views. Many users voiced support for the app and its efforts to contest the bill, which include a full-screen notification encouraging users to call their representatives; some accused the US of being hypocritical.
     
            “Let me tell a joke: American society is liberal and democratic, and it has a complete market economy,” said a comment with 2,000 upvotes.
     
            The state-run Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, has also sprung to TikTok’s defense.
     
            In an editorial last week, it accused the US of “openly trying to rob TikTok.”
     
             “The image of free speech and rule of law in the US is in tatters, and the latest bill is simply further evidence of this,” it said.

            A deadly suspected gas explosion ripped through a residential neighborhood in northern China on Wednesday, leaving a scene of devastation.
     
            The powerful blast occurred just before 8 a.m. at a ground-floor restaurant in a residential area of Sanhe city, Hebei province, east of the capital Beijing, state broadcaster CCTV said.
     
            It killed seven people, injured 27 others, and destroyed the four-story building, according to CCTV.
     
            Authorities have “basically determined” the explosion was caused by a gas leak, though they have not identified the specific cause or location of the blast, the broadcaster reported.
     
            The dramatic blast and its aftermath were captured in footage circulating on Chinese social media site Weibo, which showed a large fireball exploding from a multistory building, destroying its walls and ceiling and sending huge plumes of smoke into the sky.
     
            At least three buildings were severely damaged, with one left in a skeletal state. Firefighters were seen putting out the blaze, surrounded by crushed cars and piles of debris, according to videos and photos on Weibo.
     
            Local residents said on social media they heard a loud bang in the early morning and felt their buildings trembling.
     
            Buildings across the street from the blast site were also impacted, with glass shattered and shop signs damaged, footage aired on CCTV showed.
     
            By Wednesday afternoon, the fire had been put out and residents living within 500 meters (1,640 feet) of the site had been evacuated, CCTV said.
     
            China has seen a series of deadly incidents caused by gas leaks in recent years.
     
            Last June, a gas explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwest Ningxia region killed 31 people. Following that blast, Chinese market regulators issued detailed guidelines on the use of gas appliances and cookers to avoid safety risks.

            Zhong Shanshan, China’s richest man, is facing a wave of attacks from nationalists who accuse him of a lack of patriotism in a campaign that has hit the price of shares of his beverage company and threatens to hurt its sales.
     
            Zhong and his drinks firm Nongfu Spring, the country’s biggest maker of bottled water, are the latest targets of an army of internet zealots. Calls for a boycott of Nongfu have even alarmed typically patriotic state media outlets at a time when Beijing is trying to rally support behind private businesses to help counter an economic slump.
     
            The criticism was triggered by the death last month of Zong Qinghou, the founder of Wahaha Group, one of Nongfu’s biggest competitors. Zong was a revered nationalist figure who famously took on French food company Danone in a business dispute about 20 years ago, and won.
     
            His passing sparked unflattering comparisons to Zhong and snowballed into attacks on everything from perceived Japanese elements in the packaging of Nongfu Spring products to the American citizenship held by Zhong’s son — a non-executive director of the company and possible successor to take over the business.
     
            “Zhong Shuzi will inherit his father’s huge assets. But as the future richest man in China, he is an American national. It’s unbelievable,” said a Weibo user with the name “Internationale.”
     
            Online critics have compared carp-shaped designs on the label of Nongfu Spring’s brown rice tea drink to Japan’s traditional carp flag koinobori windsocks. They have also circulated photos and videos online linking a temple featured on the label of one of its green tea drinks to Tokyo’s Sensoji.
     
            “A person without feelings for his country … no matter how rich he is, is not as good as an ordinary person with a Chinese heart,” said the Weibo user “Internationale.”
     
            The nationalists have also highlighted the fact that prominent US investment funds, including Vanguard and BlackRock, are major shareholders of Nongfu Spring.
     
            “[The son] will eventually manage the company as an American national. But as a Chinese, I only support our own national brands,” another Weibo user commented.
     
            The boycott calls have become rampant online. In one short video, a small shop was seen replacing all its bottled water from Nongfu with Wahaha’s. In another, a supermarket returned a Nongfu freezer displaying its drinks to the company. The video has gone viral on the Douyin platform with more than 300,000 likes.
     
            The online campaign has dealt a blow to Nongfu’s share price. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have lost nearly 5% since the end of February, wiping about $3 billion off its market capitalization, according to a CNN calculation.
     
            Zhong has also seen $2 billion evaporate from his personal wealth since March 1, according to the Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. He’s currently worth $64.5 billion and is still the richest person in China, according to the Index.
     
            Zhong has sought to set the record straight about his reported rivalry with the founder of Wahaha, but has been unable to calm tempers online.
     
            “Taking advantage of Mr Zong’s death, a lot of slander against me and Nongfu Spring appeared on the internet. This is definitely not something Mr Zong would like to see,” Zhong said in a March 3 post on his company’s WeChat account.
     
            He called on netizens not to be “misled” by some online influencers who he said had tried to stir up trouble between the two companies.
     
            “Whether Wahaha or Nongfu Spring, we always insist on the same thing — producing good products for the people,” he said.
     
            CNN has reached out to Nongfu Spring for comment.
     
            But his statement wasn’t enough to stop the boycott calls. The nationalism on display has prompted state media to defend privately owned companies.
     
            In the first week of March, Zhejiang Daily, the official paper of the Communist Party in the eastern province of Zhejiang, published an opinion piece and an editorial on WeChat, urging netizens to stop attacking private enterprises and entrepreneurs.
     
            The province is home to many of the country’s most influential private companies, such as Alibaba (BABA) and Geely Auto as well as both Nongfu Spring and Wahaha.
     
            “Zong and Zhong are both excellent private entrepreneurs,” Wei Jiang, former chancellor of Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, wrote in the opinion piece. “Especially now, private enterprises are facing unprecedented challenges. We should protect them even more.”
     
            The newspaper reiterated in the editorial that Beijing’s policy is to support the private sector.
     
            “At present, economic development is turning from warm to cold and facing many challenges. As long as private enterprises are operating legally, all sectors of society should encourage and support them to create more wealth, more tax revenue, and more employment opportunities, instead of doing things that chill the hearts of people in the private sector,” it said.
     
            Nongfu Spring is just the latest major target of China’s nationalists.
     
            They have also been going after Mo Yan, the Nobel literature laureate, for allegedly insulting the People’s Liberation Army and China’s revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, as well as “beautifying” the Japanese army, which invaded the country, in his novels.
     
            Many global and Chinese brands have been caught in the crossfire over the years.
     
            In 2022, Li Ning, a sportswear manufacturer founded by the well known athlete, came under fire for new designs that allegedly resembled hats worn by Japanese soldiers during World War II. The ensuing boycott dealt a blow to the company’s sales and share price, with $2 billion wiped off the company’s market value within two days.
     
            In March 2021, a raft of Western brands like H&M, Nike and Adidas were boycotted by nationalist consumers for refusing to use cotton produced in the western region of Xinjiang.
     
            The United States has banned imports of cotton products from Xinjiang over concerns that they were produced with forced labor — a claim Beijing has denied.
     
            And in 2012, anti-Japanese protests erupted in China after a territorial conflict between Japan and China over the Diaoyu Islands, which are called the Senkaku Islands by Japan.
     
            Many protesters smashed Japanese cars and vandalized shops selling Japanese goods, according to state media. Carmakers such as Toyota and Honda reported falls in their monthly sales in China.

            Chinese banks are reportedly scrambling to bail out one of the country’s biggest property developers after its credit rating was downgraded to “junk” status by Moody’s on Monday.
     
            Beijing has been struggling to restore confidence in the country’s ailing real estate industry and appears to be working flat out to prevent China Vanke going the way of Evergrande and Country Garden, which both defaulted on their debts and are at risk of being liquidated.
     
            Chinese state media reported Tuesday that 12 major banks, including the six largest state-owned lenders, were in talks to provide a syndicated loan for Vanke worth as much as 80 billion yuan ($11.2 billion) to enable the company to meet upcoming repayment deadlines.
     
            The provision of the loan is still uncertain, state media outlet Cailianshe reported, citing an unnamed source close to the potential deal. Another state media outlet, the Economic Observer, reported that several insurance companies have sent teams to Vanke’s headquarters for a new round of debt negotiations in a bid to avert a default. CNN has reached out to Vanke for comment.
     
            Founded 40 years ago, Vanke was the country’s second largest developer by sales last year but it has been hammered by the collapse in demand for apartments and the slump in home prices.
     
            Vanke’s stock soared in Hong Kong and Shenzhen following the reports of potential new financing. On Tuesday, its Hong Kong-listed shares ended up 10.3%, while the Shenzhen-traded stock closed 5.7% higher. But they are still in negative territory so far this year.
     
            On Monday, Moody’s cut Vanke’s rating to Ba1, which is often referred to as a junk rating. That means the company needs to offer a higher yield on its bonds to compensate for the greater risk of payment default that bond investors are taking on.
     
            “The rating actions reflect Moody’s expectation that China Vanke’s credit metrics, financial flexibility and liquidity buffer will weaken over the next 12 to 18 months because of its declining contracted sales and the rising uncertainties over its access to funding amid the prolonged property market downturn in China,” Kaven Tsang, a senior vice president at Moody’s said in a press release.
     
            Other international ratings agencies S&P and Fitch have kept Vanke’s ratings at investment grade.
     
            Founded in 1984 in Shenzhen, Vanke is a flagship company in China’s property sector. Its founder Wang Shi is considered the “Godfather” of the industry and was likened to Donald Trump by Time magazine. It was the first listed property company in mainland China, boasting a high-profile IPO in 1991 on the still-nascent Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
     
            In 2017, in order to fend off a hostile takeover bid by a Chinese activist investor, the company let the Shenzhen government step in as its top shareholder. Currently, 33.4% of Vanke is owned by Shenzhen Metro, which is controlled by the city, according to Refinitiv Eikon.
     
            Before its cash crunch became public late last year, the company was one of the few developers that had been considered financially sound by international rating agencies.

            Moody’s move reflects growing worries that toxic market conditions, including weak demand and a tough financing environment, in China’s property industry are dragging down even relatively healthy companies with solid state backing.
     
            Vanke’s contracted sales declined 10% in 2023 to 376.12 billion yuan ($52.4 billion). In January 2024, its sales dropped by 32%.
     
            Investors have been dumping Vanke’s shares in the past few months. Its Hong Kong-listed stock has lost nearly 30% since November. So far this year, it’s down 9%.
     
            Beijing has been scrambling to fix its real estate crisis since 2021, when Evergrande, the world’s most indebted developer, defaulted on its international debt. The crisis subsequently spread, with dozens of major developers also failing to repay creditors. The fallout — which has undermined the confidence of homebuyers, businesses and investors — has threatened the broader economy.
 
            The stimulus measures rolled out by Chinese authorities have so far failed to revive the sector. In 2023, property sales dropped 6.5% from 2022. Property investment fell 9.6%, the second straight year of decline.
     
            Last week, Ni Hong, China’s housing minister, told reporters during the National People’s Congress that regulators will support the “reasonable” financing needs of real estate developers.
     
            He reiterated a “whitelist” mechanism that was recently established to inject liquidity into the crisis-hit sector. More than 6,000 property projects across the country have been matched with development loans by banks.
     
            But he also said Beijing will not bail out developers that are “seriously” in trouble.
     
            “For real estate companies that are seriously insolvent and have lost their operating capabilities, [we should] let them go bankrupt or be restructured,” he said.
     
            “We view the tone as negative,” Nomura analysts wrote on Monday. They said Ni has made clear that the government’s priority is to ensure delivery of property projects, not to protect the developers’ businesses.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/south-korea-fu-bao-panda-china-intl-hnk/index.html,"South Koreans mourn as country’s first celebrity panda, Fu Bao, heads to China","Ever since her 2020 birth, Fu Bao has been one of South Korea’s biggest celebrities,fans eagerly following every milestone of her life at Everland Resort’s Panda World, a theme park in Yongin city.","Mar 12, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Yoonjung Seo,China,"
            Ever since her 2020 birth, Fu Bao has been one of South Korea’s biggest celebrities, with fans eagerly following every milestone of her life at Everland Resort’s Panda World, a theme park in Yongin city.
     
            But the country’s most famous and beloved giant panda is set to bid South Korea a final farewell in April, with preparations now underway for her journey to her new home in China.
     
            During the last week of Fu Bao’s public viewing earlier this month, visitors reportedly endured wait times of 5-6 hours just to catch a glimpse of the celebrity bear for a mere five minutes, as the park restricted viewing times to manage the influx of visitors, according to park officials.
     
            On Fu Bao’s last day of public viewing on March 3, she received farewell gifts, including a panda family doll crafted from bamboo, a bouquet of flowers and heart-shaped pieces of bread from her dedicated keepers at Everland.
     
            Born to parents Ai Bao and Le Bao in July 2020 as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” program, Fu Bao is South Korea’s first naturally-bred panda.
     
            In the days following her birth, Everland’s social media channels offered fans a steady diet of Fu Bao videos, with its YouTube channel pulling in more than 1.2 million subscribers and, as of February, surpassing 500 million cumulative views, according to the park.
     
            A two-hour video chronicling Fu Bao’s journey from birth to childhood added to the Everland YouTube channel eight months ago has garnered 1.6 million views.
     
            The most recent videos on the channel are now filled with warm and heartfelt messages from viewers, including the beloved cub’s self-proclaimed “online aunties.”
     
            “Fu Bao, you’re a happy treasure that came to us like a miracle during the difficult Covid pandemic,” reads one Youtube comment.
     
            “Your auntie’s been so happy to have known you and you made me smile so much. You’re a clever one so I’m so sure you’ll do well in a new environment!”
     
            Another commented that they “can’t believe how time passes so quickly” and that “we have to let Fu Bao go. I’m so sad to let her go … I support our Fu and love you. Every moment knowing you has been a great joy with laughter. Thank you.”
     
            Thanks to Fu Bao’s widespread popularity, her dedicated zookeeper has also found himself in the spotlight, becoming a bit of a social media star himself. 
 
            Often referred to as her grandpa, Kang Chul-won offered his own farewell message for Fu Bao, noting that the Korean people’s special love for her all began with social media videos shared during the Covid pandemic when the zoo was closed.
     
            “She brought help and happiness to a society in many ways that was having a difficult time due to the coronavirus,” Kang said in a video posted to YouTube.
     
            During remarks to the press earlier this month, he said people visited the social media sites every day so it felt like he was “raising her together with them.”
     
            “Of course there are aspects of her cuteness and playfulness, but they cared so much for her and they shared the same emotions of raising a cub together during such difficult times,” Kang said.
     
            Though one could argue it’s impossible to identify a single social media moment that catapulted Fu Bao to stardom, there are a couple of standout videos that have been particularly popular with viewers.
     
            In one video, Fu Bao clings tightly to Kang’s leg, unwilling to let go, as he spins gently around the room. After many attempts to uncoil her strong arms, he finally separates himself from her.
     
            The other short video shows Fu Bao clinging to Kang’s arm while relaxing on a wooden bench. As the zookeeper gently pushes her arm so he can take his phone out of his pocket, the panda links her arms tightly around his left arm.
     
            After he motions to show something on the phone to her, she rolls onto her back.

            In an announcement from Everland, the company says Fu Bao will be transferred to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan Province in early April.
     
            Everland said that it will keep her in a separate space at Everland Panda World for a month to prepare her to adjust to her new environment before her overseas transfer, which will be carried out in accordance with international regulations.
     
            According to the agreement between Samsung C&T, the parent company of Everland, and the China Wildlife Conservation Association, mature pandas must be returned to China before they turn four years old.
     
            Once Fu Bao departs for China, there will be four giant pandas left at Everland – Fu Bao’s mother Ai Bao, father Le Bao, and their twin babies Rui Bao and Hui Bao, who were born last July.

            As China grapples with a struggling economy and an intensifying tech war with the United States, its leaders had one message for the thousands of political elites gathering in Beijing: the country will stay the course in becoming a high-tech powerhouse under the helm of one man – supreme leader Xi Jinping.
     
            That note of confidence was echoed throughout a week of highly choreographed meetings of China’s rubber-stamp national legislature and top political advisory body, which concluded Monday with a ceremony in the cavernous Great Hall of the People.
     
            The event, held largely without Covid restrictions for the first time in years, is a rare chance for the world to glimpse into an increasingly opaque political system under Xi.
     
            Here are the major takeaways from the gathering:
     
            The closing day of the National People’s Congress legislature on Monday was missing a key event – a press conference conducted by the Chinese premier. For decades, this curtain-closing “two sessions” tradition had offered foreign media and the Chinese public a rare opportunity to get first-hand insight into the thinking of the country’s nominal No. 2 official, who is charged with running its economy.
     
            However, Beijing made the surprise announcement that it was scrapping the event last week, in a move that generated concern among observers about the ever-shrinking transparency of the Chinese government.
     
            The more recent tradition of collective leadership, a model that came to the fore after the chaos of Mao Zedong’s strongman rule, has taken a backseat once again under Xi. The Premier and his State Council, which functions as China’s cabinet, have been increasingly sidelined in recent years as Xi ramped up the party’s role controlling the government and the messages it sends.
     
            That was further underscored on Monday, when delegates rubber stamped an update to a law governing the organization of the State Council. Observers say the changes further formalized the body’s role as carrying out the directives of the Chinese Communist Party.
     
            An overarching theme of the gathering was a push to focus China’s economic model on technology innovation and transform the country into a high-tech powerhouse.
     
            In an address last week Premier Li called for boosting “self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” spelling out a push to upgrade industrial supply chains and enhance China’s position as a high-tech innovator. That included a boost to China’s annual budget for science and technology by 10% to an unprecedented 370.8 billion yuan ($51.6 billion).
     
            Also highlighted was a new policy buzzword “new quality productive forces,” a term coined by Xi last year to refer to high tech sectors such as new energy vehicles, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing – signifying the leader’s desire to push the country ahead in the global race for critical technologies.
     
            The emphasis on self-reliance in science and technology comes after the United States tightened control over the export of cutting-edge technologies to China, especially in the field of AI, which Washington said could be used to strengthen the Chinese military.
     
            On the sidelines of the “two sessions,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the US of “devising various tactics to suppress China” and slammed Washington’s trade and tech controls as reaching “bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity.”
     
            The economy was in the spotlight this year as China has been roiled by a property sector crisis, hefty local government debt, deflation, a stock market rout and tech friction with the US — all fueling public frustration and a loss of investor confidence.
     
            Chinese leaders presiding over the event were keen to project confidence in the economy, rolling out an ambitious economic growth target of around 5% for 2024, but without announcing any major stimulus measures to increase flagging consumption.
     
            That appeared to disappoint investors who’d been closely watching the gathering – with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tumbling 2.6% on Tuesday after the targets were announced. The index has fallen by about 1% so far this week and has lost nearly 20% over the past 12 months.
     
            Li conceded in his remarks that hitting that target “will not be easy,” given that a Covid-battered 2022 had provided a lower base of growth for last year, but he also vowed that China would make industrial upgrading a priority while leaning into tech innovation.
     
            The annual meeting of the National People’s Congress disappointed some observers who were hoping to see certain key personnel appointments made at this year’s gathering – a move that would fill senior State Council roles left vacant for months after an abrupt shake-up in the ranks of Xi’s hand-picked ministers.
     
            Foreign Minister Qin Gang was abruptly removed from his post without explanation in July followed by the removal of Defense Minister Li Shangfu months later, also without explanation. Both men had first vanished from public view and have been replaced.
     
            Some observers expected that Beijing could appoint a new Foreign Minister at this year’s gathering. The role has been filled, in what many expected to be a temporary capacity, by senior diplomat and former Foreign Minister Wang Yi since Qin’s ouster.
     
            Two high-ranking posts in China’s cabinet previously occupied by Li and Qin remain open. But Beijing declined to fill those posts at this year’s event.

            They’ve gone after bloggers, journalists, artists, comedians and celebrity chefs. Now, some of China’s most zealous online nationalists have a new target in their crosshairs: the country’s first officially recognized Nobel laureate.
     
            Mo Yan, a novelist best known for his earthy tales of rural life in China, sparked national pride when he became the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012. A top Communist Party official sent a letter of congratulations, hailing his win as a reflection of the rise of Chinese literature and the country’s “overall national strength and international influence.”
     
            More than a decade on, the 69-year-old writer is under fire from a belligerent brand of nationalism that has thrived under Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades.
     
            Under Xi, the Communist Party has cracked down on dissenting views, including those seen as straying from its official narrative on history. That has spurred a growing army of nationalist commentators to wage a social media crusade against “harmful” comments about the country’s past, especially depictions that cast the party in a less glorious light.
     
            Among those leading the charge is Wu Wanzheng, a self-proclaimed patriotic blogger who goes by the online name of “Truth-Telling Mao Xinghuo.” For over a year, Wu has hurled attacks at Mo and his novels, accusing them of “distorting history” and smearing the Communist Party’s revolutionary legacy.
     
            His campaign drew wide attention last month, when the blogger announced he would sue the celebrated writer, whose real name is Guan Moye, for insulting national heroes and martyrs – a crime punishable by up to three years in prison under a law passed in 2018.
     
            Wu listed dozens of alleged transgressions in Mo’s books, including his acclaimed novel “Red Sorghum,” a story of love and resistence spanning three generations of a rural Chinese family in the 20th century, starting from the early years of the war against Japanese invasion.
     
            Citing excerpts of the book, Wu took issue with Mo’s characters in the Communist army who didn’t want to fight the Japanese. He also accused Mo of glorifying Japanese invaders by portraying some of them as handsome.
     
            “As an upright and patriotic young man, I am outraged. Does our country tolerate such behavior?” he wrote.
     
            Wu demanded Mo apologize and offer 1 yuan ($0.14) to each Chinese citizen as compensation. He also wanted Mo’s “problematic books” to be taken off the shelves across China, according to his posts on Weibo, where he now boasts nearly 220,000 followers.
     
            Wu’s attempt to take Mo to court sparked heated debate online on the excesses of nationalism, censorship and the shrinking space for artistic and cultural freedoms.
     
            But while many nationalist users cheered Wu on, others came to Mo’s defense likening the attack to the specter of Mao’s tumultuous Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals and artists were denounced, publicly humiliated and beaten by young Red Guards.
     
            “Over the years, our society has become increasingly intolerant and full of taboos,” Zhang Yongsheng, a writer and literature professor at the Tongji University in Shanghai, wrote in a commentary on social media.
     
            “If I don’t speak up this time, more writers, including myself, could be sued in the future; more professors, including myself, could be convicted for their words.”

            Even Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of the hardline tabloid Global Times, appeared alarmed by the nationalist outburst. He accused Wu of creating a publicity stunt by “maliciously framing” the Nobel laureate and taking his words out of context. (Wu has hit back and vowed to launch a separate lawsuit against Hu.)
     
            Throughout the controversy, Mo, whose pen name means “don’t speak,” has kept his silence in public. Chinese authorities and state media have also refrained from weighing in.
     
            Many are waiting to see how the government will react. Wu’s attempt to file a civilian lawsuit against Mo was rejected by a court in Beijing, citing insufficient information. The blogger is now trying to file a public interest lawsuit instead.
     
            Murong Xuecun, an independent Chinese writer and renowned novelist who now lives in exile, said the “chilling effect” of Xi’s crackdown on free speech had spurred the attacks against Mo.
     
            “Xi has encouraged the eradication of all dissenting voices. Under such a political environment, the nationalist bloggers often swarm in to find anything they can attack to show that they are more loyal to Xi’s regime,” he said.
     
            Born into a farming family in rural Shandong province, Mo grew up in poverty, hunger and the turbulence of the Mao era. He dropped out of primary school during the Cultural Revolution and spent his teenage years toiling on farms. At 21, he enlisted in the army; a few years later, he started writing fiction while serving as a military officer.
     
            Mo’s novels are often set against the backdrop of modern China, from the Japanese invasion and the Great Famine to the Cultural Revolution. Laced with fantasy, satire and a dark sense of humor, his stories depict the struggle, suffering and resilience of ordinary individuals, without shying away from the brutality, greed and corruption under Communist rule.
     
            “Literature should never be a tool for singing praises. Literature and art should expose darkness and reveal social injustice, which includes revealing the dark side of the human soul and what evil is made of,” he said in a speech in Hong Kong in 2005.
     
            At times, his writing may seem to be flirting dangerously close with crossing the party’s red lines. But most of Mo’s works, composed during a period of relative openness in China, were able to pass censors – and some of them went on to win major domestic literary awards.
     
            In public, Mo played a delicate balancing act, carefully avoiding comments that would upset authorities. In 2011, he was named the vice chairman of the state-run Chinese Writers Association – an appointment that could not have been made without the blessing of the party.

            Mo’s good standing with the Chinese government has stirred controversy after his Nobel win. Some criticized Mo for not speaking up for fellow Chinese laureate Liu Xiaobo, the jailed dissident who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 (Liu later died in custody); others questioned if Mo deserved the Literature Prize, which is often given to writers who forcefully oppose political repression.
     
            The prize brought Mo world recognition, but also greater scrutiny at home. In the ensuing years, the writer who once prided himself on telling the truth has increasingly toed the party line in public speeches.
     
            In 2013, months after Xi came to power, Mo delivered a searing defense of Chairman Mao, comparing those seeking to “deny, demonize and caricaturize” the supreme leader to “earthworms trying to shake a big tree.”
     
            And in 2016, Mo lavished praise on Xi at a meeting of the Chinese Writers Association, describing the leader as “a great person, a well-read person, a person with a high appreciation of art and a true expert.”
     
            “General Secretary Xi is our reader, our friend, and – of course – our ideological guide,” he told his fellow writers who had gathered in Beijing from across the country.
     
            Murong, the exiled writer, doesn’t believe Mo was speaking his mind.
     
            “The way I understand it is that these are the survival skills Mo has chosen to adopt given the (political) environment,” he said.
     
            Nevertheless, Mo’s effusive praises were not enough to protect him against the nationalist attacks.
     
            In 2022, Sima Nan, a nationalist pundit known for his inflammatory criticism of the United States, famously accused Mo’s Nobel win of being a Western effort to smear China.
     
            “This just shows how bad the situation for free speech has become,” Murong said. “More writers will be thinking: no one is safe.”

            China’s consumer inflation turned positive for the first time in six months, largely supported by the Lunar New Year holiday, when a spending boom pushed up prices.
     
            The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.7% in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Saturday, versus a rise of 0.3% forecast in a Reuters poll.
     
            This was the first time the index has shown prices rising, rather than flatlining or falling, since August 2023. In January, the index fell by the fastest rate in 15 years.
     
            But analysts said the year-on-year gain was partly due to the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year and in January last year. Based on cycles of the moon, the date of the holiday changes each year.
     
            “I think it is too early to conclude that deflation in China is over,” said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist for Pinpoint Asset Management. “Domestic demand is still quite weak.”
     
            China fought weak prices for most of last year due to a property slump, a stock market meltdown and subdued consumer sentiment. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has cut interest rates several times in the hope of boosting bank lending and bringing inflation back to its target of 3%. But the CPI only reached 0.2% in 2023, way below the official goal.
     
            Deflation is bad for the economy because consumers and companies may put off purchases or investments in anticipation of prices falling further. That, in turn, could create a vicious cycle and result in even less spending, more business cutbacks and higher unemployment.
     
            Services prices in February were strong, particularly in relation to tourism and entertainment activities. The sub-index for tourism soared 23.1% from a year ago, the highest among all categories.
     
            But the holiday effect is likely to fade next month.
     
            “We expect CPI inflation to fall to 0.4% year-on-year in March,” Nomura analysts said on Monday in a research report, adding that food prices have already been declining since the conclusion of the festivities.
     
            Producer deflation, meanwhile, intensified last month. The Producer Price Index, which measures wholesale prices at the factory gate, dropped by 2.7% from a year ago.
     
            The drop marked the 17th consecutive month of decline, indicating persistent deflationary pressures in the upstream industries and implying soft consumption demand.
     
            Beijing continues to face a tough task this year to stimulate growth and fight deflation. Last Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang said the government had set this year’s growth target at around 5% and inflation target at 3%.
     
            But he also pledged to “transform” the growth model and curb debt risks in the economy, which could mean less aggressive investments by local governments to build infrastructure.
     
            Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the PBOC, told reporters last Wednesday that the central bank would maintain a supportive stance on monetary easing, suggesting that it could cut rates further this year to bolster the economy.
     
            Zheng Shanjie, head of the country’s economic planner, said on the same day that the government would launch a new initiative to spur consumer spending, including promoting large-scale equipment upgrades and the replacement of old durable goods, such as cars and home appliances, with new ones.
     
            But the key to growth and rising prices will be how Beijing implements its policy to stimulate demand and boost confidence, analysts said.
     
            “With the [National People’s Congress] now largely behind us, all eyes could be on the demand-side initiatives, especially the trade-in program for durable goods,” Citi analysts said on Monday.

            As America bustled through key political moments last week, with voters casting Super Tuesday ballots and President Joe Biden laying out his national priorities in the State of the Union address, China was busy conducting the largest annual showing of its own political process.
     
            In Beijing, where thousands of delegates from around the country convened for a largely ceremonial meeting to rubber stamp a yearly agenda set by the Communist Party-controlled government, the focus was on domestic concerns – from economic goals to hailing the leadership of Xi Jinping.
     
            But looming over that gathering was also the near certainty that former President Donald Trump would run against Biden in November elections – and that either winner would continue to drive a tough China policy.
     
            Senior Chinese leaders didn’t publicly mention the American election as the Beijing event got underway. But a key strategy promoted there – to transform the country into a high-tech powerhouse – was widely seen as part of an urgent bid to safeguard the country in the face of Biden administration technology curbs and a fractious US-China relationship ahead.
     
            Top diplomat Wang Yi flashed a clearer sign of the anxiety underlying that strategy during a press briefing on the sidelines of the gathering. There, he reached for some of his most dramatic language to date on US trade and tech controls targeting China, saying they had hit “bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity.”
     
            Behind closed doors, however, observers of elite Chinese politics say, the discussion about the upcoming elections themselves is likely much more direct – especially when it comes to the impact of the return of Trump, who is widely seen as a far more unpredictable force than Biden.
     
            The former leader reshaped relations between the world’s two largest economies with massive trade tariffs while in office four years ago. He’s now threatening, if elected, to raise those to a level that experts say could trigger a de facto decoupling – a shock that would hit at a delicate time for the Chinese economy.
     
            But a return of Trump to office also has the potential to upturn the current geopolitical balance, which has seen America and its allies increasingly united against Russia and the perceived threat of a rising China.
     
            A US retreat from those partners under Trump’s “America First” stance could take pressure off China and present a significant opportunity for Beijing’s own global ambitions.
     
            Officials who are part of the ruling Communist Party’s foreign affairs office have likely been tasked with “scenario-planning and evidence-informed analyses” of the implications of a Trump or Biden win, which would each pose different risks for Beijing, according to Brian Wong, a fellow at the University of Hong Kong’s Centre on Contemporary China and the World.
     
            Experts say Chinese policymakers will be considering how each administration would impact China’s core goal of taking control of the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan, its drive to expand its global power and influence, and its efforts to stabilize and strengthen its already battered economy.
     
            “The priorities are to ensure China remains secure from foreign security and military interference, that it is financially and economically secure,” Wong added.
     
            When Trump arrived in the White House in 2017 as a political newcomer, Xi appeared to see a potential opening to strengthen ties that were showing signs of strain during the previous Obama administration.
     
            After being welcomed to Trump’s oceanside Mar-a-Lago property in April that year, the Chinese leader hosted Trump and first lady Melania in Beijing for what was widely described at the time as a “state visit plus.” The president was given rare perks that seemed tailored to appeal to the businessman and former reality television star, including a televised welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People and a personal tour by Xi of imperial treasures at the Forbidden City.
     
            Then, Trump lavished praised on his host, saying they had “great chemistry,” and calling the authoritarian leader “a very special man.”
     
            But within a year the relationship had turned contentious as Trump unleashed a major tranche of tariffs – starting with 25% on $50 billion in Chinese goods – sparking an escalating trade war. Relations continued to spiral over a host of issues from US national security alarm over Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to China’s handling of the outbreak of Covid-19.
     
            This time around, Trump, who is known for his penchant for authoritarian leaders, has continued to praise Xi along the campaign trail. But he’s also drummed up speculation that to combat what he sees as unfair trade practices he could hit Chinese imports with a tariff upward of 60% – and revoke its fundamental “permanent normalized trade relations” status.
     
            A move at that level would create a significant upheaval in trade ties – potentially dropping China’s share in US imports from nearly one-fifth to around 3%, according to analysis by Oxford Economics.
     
            “If this decoupling is carried out by Trump 2.0 in a very forceful way, the impact on China is going to be very severe. But whether this will happen is unclear, nobody can say what Trump will do, and this is the problem,” said Bala Ramasamy, a professor of economics at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.
     
            Such controls would come at an extremely bad time for the Chinese economy, which is already facing flagging consumer demand and falling prices amid a host of other issues from high youth unemployment to a property sector scourge.

‘Two sessions’: China scraps a decades-long political tradition as Xi tightens control amid economic woes
 
            Economic hardship across China is fueling mounting public frustration – as well as concern about the direction set by the ruling Communist Party leaders, who have long linked their legitimacy to economic stability and growth.
     
            “China must be scared if Trump would return,” said Shanghai-based foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, pointing to the lack of demand within China to pick up the excess capacity from such a potentially significant drop in exports to the US.
     
            “Without enough to export, enough to be employed, enough to earn money to consume domestically, there would be more social challenges within China,” he said.
     
            It’s unclear if Trump would follow through on such drastic measures, which would be highly controversial in the US and, analysts say, also have a sharp impact on the US economy and jobs, especially as Beijing would likely retaliate. But experts say China’s business and official sectors are likely already considering contingency plans.
     
            More Chinese firms could set up shop in places like Southeast Asia and Latin America to see their goods finished there to dodge the tax. Chinese leaders would likely look to cultivate deeper relationships with other markets – like Europe and their partners across the Belt and Road connectivity initiative – to fill the gap.
     
            A new trade war would also likely see a ramping up of anti-US rhetoric within China – fanned by the government and its online moderators, who would seek to channel any discontent about the economic impact on the US.
     
            Already some chatter can be seen on Chinese social media platforms, where users jeered reports of Trump’s 60% tariff threat, with one writing “the more you add, the better. Americans pay the bill themselves,” and another saying, “if you’re going to decouple, just decouple … we don’t like working 996 (long hours) producing for you anyway.”
     
            But that doesn’t mean China’s leaders would welcome a Biden win.
     
            The current president is widely seen in China as a more level-headed operator whose interest in global stability makes him willing to work with Beijing in some areas. He’s also a more familiar entity to Xi himself, who has met the president over the course of more than a decade, including when they were both vice presidents.
     
            The two most recently sat down together in November for a summit that achieved the intended goal of stabilizing relations, including repairing a severed high-level military communications line – an outcome widely viewed by the international community as a positive for maintaining peace in a tense Indo-Pacific.

            But Biden has sparked fierce disappointment among the foreign policy community in China after coming to office, observers say, as he largely kept the Trump-era tariffs in place – and then added a raft of policy aimed at preventing American high-tech and funding from being used to enhance Chinese military and technological capabilities. Analysts say these controls have, for now, significantly affected China’s semiconductor ecosystem and its development.
     
            The president highlighted those measures in his State of the Union address on Thursday, which came just days after Chinese Premier Li Qiang delivered what is roughly China’s equivalent, the government work report, emphasizing the need for China to boost its own high-tech development and “self-reliance.”
     
            China’s high-tech push stems from several factors, including Xi’s overarching goal of “national rejuvenation” to make China prosperous at home and a dominant power globally. But analysts say the impact of those Biden administration controls – and the prospect of more to come – have raised the urgency of this bid.
     
            Meanwhile, Biden’s careful nurturing of American alliances across Asia – seen in his efforts to bring Seoul and Tokyo closer together on regional security collaboration and military drills, despite their own historical frictions, and his backing of security groupings like AUKUS and the Quad – has made Beijing increasingly wary.
     
            The same is true for the president’s tightening of the US’s transatlantic relations in support of Ukraine against Russia’s invasion – and his success in bringing European partners onside in a bid to “de-risk” supply chains from Chinese goods.
     
            “Biden uses an alliance strategy to isolate China far more effectively than Trump, and while Biden would probably not increase tariffs on China, he could make China’s ability to produce high tech products far less likely,” said Shen in Shanghai, adding “Biden may not be China’s bet.”
     
            Trump sent shock waves through European capitals last month when he said he would not defend NATO allies that failed to spend enough on defense.
     
            The former president has also shown himself willing to launch trade measures against Europe – a move that would be sure to sour relations with a bloc that already views him skeptically for his apparent deference to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and more recently his efforts to sink a US Congressional deal to fund Ukraine’s defense.
     
            That could open a potentially major opportunity for Xi, whose close ties with Putin and refusal to condemn his invasion have damaged China’s relationship with Europe and set back its longtime bid to drive a wedge between Europe and the United States.
     
            Chinese academics have also noted that “unilateralist” Trump has shown little interest in maintaining an American position leading a global world order – a mantle Xi has been angling to pick up. Trump is also widely seen by Chinese foreign policy thinkers as a destabilizing force for the US domestically.
     
            And in addition to comments about NATO, the former president has also criticized American defense pacts with Japan and South Korea – at several points appearing to threaten to pull US troops stationed in those allied countries.
     
            Diminished American alliances in the region would play to China’s benefit, including when it comes to its designs on the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan, analysts say. China’s Communist Party claims the island as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take it, by force if necessary.

            Trump has supported Congressional efforts bolstering America’s unofficial relations and defense support for Taiwan. But his talk of a general reluctance to embroil America in costly wars and of diminishing US ties with regional allies has raised concerns among some observers that he could send a signal to Beijing that Washington is not focused on the fate of Taiwan.
     
            The former president’s return to office, however, would make for “less predictability” and could “pose greater tail-end risks when it comes to accidental kinetic escalation induced by posturing from either Beijing or Washington,” according to Wong in Hong Kong.
     
            A second Biden term, he noted, could see a “more successful multi-lateral, concerted effort aimed at containing China,” with a “tacit agreement to not allow for unbridled escalation over Taiwan and the South China Sea,” another pressure point in relations between the two.
     
            Biden has appeared as a staunch backer of Taiwan, at times appearing to step away from America’s policy of strategic ambiguity to say the US would defend the island militarily if attacked (though such statements have quickly been walked back by White House staffers who say the policy remains.)
     
            Together, all this raises a complicated picture for Chinese officials. But it’s also one with a clear bottom line, according to Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.
     
            “Whoever wins – the structure of (US) confrontation, competition, pressure to China are still there,” he said.

At 8 p.m. ET and PT tonight on CNN, Fareed’s latest special report, “Taiwan: Unfinished Business,” will examine the complicated history and present dangers surrounding Taiwan. 
 
            A couple of years ago, the Economist declared on its cover that Taiwan — a tiny island, home to 24 million people — was “the most dangerous place on Earth.”
     
            The reasons it came to that conclusion remain sound. In fact, they have only grown stronger recently.
     
            The backdrop to the tensions over Taiwan is, of course, the expanding geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. Ever since the rise first of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and then of former US President Donald Trump, both nations have fundamentally shifted their attitudes towards the other — from benign, to wary, to hostile.
     
            Perhaps the extraordinary and rapid growth of China and the reality of America’s dominant status made this inevitable. A rising power faces an established one, creating a situation that may be, in the words of author and Harvard international security scholar Graham Allison, “destined for war.”

Tensions rising between China and Taiwan
 
            But are we destined for war? The US and China are unusual in that while they are increasingly geopolitical rivals, they are also deeply intertwined economically.
     
            One example: During the Cold War, at the peak of US-Soviet trade, the two countries exchanged $5 billion dollars of goods with each other in one year. China and the US do $5 billion in trade every few days. And that number has not dropped that much even as tariffs, bans and restrictions on trade have grown in recent years.
     
            In addition, China does not seem to be a revolutionary state, seeking to overthrow the international system and present the world with an alternative ideology to America. That ideological rivalry, at the heart of the Cold War, is largely absent today.
     
            One thing that is present, however, is nuclear deterrence. China and the US both have large arsenals, which should have the effect they have had elsewhere — from the US and Soviet Union to Pakistan and India — in deterring all-out war.
     
            And yet … and yet: There is the problem of Taiwan that sits at the heart of US-China relations.
     
            China has never accepted that Taiwan can be an independent country. This is not a Xi Jinping innovation. It is in the constitution of the People’s Republic of China. Every Chinese leader beginning with Mao Zedong has affirmed the goal of reunifying the two, but in the past, Communist China believed that it could wait because time was on its side. Eventually, the mainland with its massive economy and billion-plus population would draw the tiny island of 24 million into its orbit.
     
            That was the thinking. But that premise is proving untrue.
     
            Taiwan has developed into a feisty democracy with a political culture defined by its political system in stark contrast to China. Over the past few decades, Taiwan has gotten more determined not to reunify with China. So, Xi must be looking at this situation and feeling that time is not on his side. That perhaps it would be better to act sooner than later.
     
            For America and its many allies in Asia, Chinese aggression to retake Taiwan would be unacceptable. Washington has been willing to accept China’s claims on Taiwan as long as it did not use coercion to achieve them.

            Taiwan policy, for all sides, has been about tolerating fantasies about the future as long as there are no practical changes in the present. Most people in Taiwan simply want to maintain the status quo and keep things going as they are. While the recent elections on the island brought to power for a third term a party that is closely associated with the idea of an independent Taiwan, it’s worth noting that it got only 40% of the vote, with the other 60% going to two candidates with less independence-minded positions.
     
            What does all this mean? That this issue will need to be managed rather than solved — and managed very carefully by both Beijing and Washington. This is one place on Earth where there should be little room for macho rhetoric and provocative actions. All three sides should keep talking to ensure there are no misperceptions or miscalculations.
     
            None of this is morally satisfying. But the stakes are high enough that one thing is clear: Were these tensions to be mismanaged, were this conflict to turn into war, it would be lose-lose-lose for all three parties; indeed, the whole world would suffer cataclysmic consequences. Better to kick this can down the road as long as possible — and hope it does not explode.

            Chinese leaders have pledged to achieve an ambitious growth rate this year, while reshaping its economic model to focus on technology innovation.
     
            But how Beijing will implement this vision remains unclear, and its resistance to any major stimulus measures to increase income and spur consumption has disappointed investors, sending them toward the exits.
     
            On Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang announced that economic growth target of around 5% for 2024, which he said “will not be easy” to hit, given that a Covid-battered 2022 had provided a lower base of growth for last year. He also vowed to make industrial upgrading a priority and lean into tech innovation.
     
            After the targets were announced on Tuesday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.6%. The index has fallen by about 1% so far this week and has lost nearly 20% over the past 12 months.
     
            “The level of support is likely too little to rocket the economy to its 5% growth target this year,” said Sarah Tan, an economist at Moody’s, referring to the measures announced by Li Tuesday.
     
            She said higher household spending was needed to put an end to deflation in China. Deflation refers to a sustained and broad decline in price levels for goods and services.
     
            In January, consumer prices fell by the fastest rate in 15 years, marking a fourth straight month of decline. In 2023, prices rose by only 0.2% over the course of the year.
     
            “The direct household transfers we were looking for” were a no-show, she added.
     
            Beijing has refrained from launching massive projects to stimulate consumption and boost the economy in recent years. It offered none of the nationwide cash handouts seen in other major economies during the Covid-era.
     
            While this has helped China avoid the rampant inflation experienced by much of the rest of the world, disposable household income has fallen as wages have stalled and property asset values have crashed.
     
            China’s growth trajectory is of great concern for global investors and policymakers who have come to rely on it to drive global economic expansion.
     
            But Beijing appears to be in a difficult position where it needs to promote growth while containing the level of government debt, which explains why stimulus measures have been modest.
     
            Three years of strict pandemic controls, which ended at the beginning of 2023, and a real estate crash have drained local government coffers, leaving authorities across the country struggling with mountains of debt.
     
 “China is walking a tightrope on the fiscal front between infrastructure stimulus and LGFV [local government financing vehicle] deleveraging,” said Goldman Sachs analysts on Wednesday.
     
            The country’s experience from 2023 suggests “local governments may be falling short of capacity to stabilize growth given the unprecedented property downturn and higher debt pressure,” they added.
     
            Li has set this year’s budget deficit at 3%, which was the same as the initial target for last year but lower than the revised final figure of 3.8%. He allowed local governments to issue 3.9 trillion yuan ($542 billion) worth of special bonds, which was at the lower end of the market forecast range of 3.8 trillion to 4.1 trillion yuan ($570 billion) and perceived to be a relatively modest amount.
     
            These special bonds are mainly used for infrastructure spending.
     
            To curb local government debt risks, Beijing instructed 12 heavily indebted local governments to delay or halt some state-funded infrastructure projects, according to a Reuters report in January, citing anonymous sources.
     
            These 12 provinces contribute about 22% to China’s total infrastructure investment and 18% of gross domestic product (GDP), the Goldman analysts estimated.
     
            Given this recent reported crackdown on local government debt, the still troubled property sector and 2023’s much higher base of comparison, “we think the ‘around ‘5%’ GDP growth target will prove very challenging,” Nomura analysts said on Tuesday.
     
            On Tuesday, much of Li’s speech was devoted to the country’s strategic goals, including plans to boost the annual budget for science and technology by 10% to $51.6 billion, the biggest increase since 2019 after years of minimal growth.
     
            The primary task of 2024 is to promote the construction of a modern industrial system and accelerate the development of “new productive forces,” he said.
     
            “New productive forces” is a term coined by President Xi Jinping last year to refer to high tech sectors such as new energy vehicles, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing.
     
            The inclusion of the term indicates Xi’s desire to promote the high-tech and green industries of the future and push the country ahead in the global race for critical technologies.

            In the work report, Premier Li pledged to move the country up the global value chains and make “made in China” products more competitive.
     
            “There was more emphasis on China’s long-term ambition to upgrade its industrial supply chain and enhance its manufacturing capabilities,” according to Peiqian Liu, Asia economist at Fidelity International.
     
            But that talk alone won’t be enough. In order to achieve the ambitious 5% growth target, more specific stimulus is needed, such as increasing manufacturing investments, Liu said.
     
            That leaves monetary policy — interest rates and other tools used by central banks — as the likely key weapon to stimulating growth.
     
            On Wednesday, Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), told reporters in Beijing that the bank has “rich” policy tools at its disposal and there is still room for further interest rate cuts.
     
            The PBOC will maintain liquidity at reasonably ample levels this year and will focus on improving confidence and stabilizing prices, he said.
     
            Last month, the PBOC cut its five-year loan prime rate by 25 basis points, the largest reduction since 2019.
     
            “We see high likelihood [for the PBOC] to expand its balance sheet more than in 2023 via structural tools” to support specific sectors, such as tech, energy, and consumption, Jefferies analysts said in a note on Tuesday.

            Hong Kong’s government unveiled a new suite of powerful national security laws on Friday that critics and foreign governments warn could deepen the ongoing crackdown in the city and further undermine its reputation as an international business hub.
     
            The 212-page draft bill tabled into the city’s opposition-less legislature introduces a range of new national security crimes including treason, espionage, external interference and disclosure of state secrets.
     
            The most serious offenses are punishable with up to life imprisonment, with the involvement of “external forces” – a byword for foreign governments and organizations – treated as an aggravating factor.
     
            China and Hong Kong’s leaders say the laws are needed as part of their drive to “restore stability” following huge and often violent democracy protests in 2019 and argue their legislation is similar to other national security laws around the world.
     
            Critics counter that what China’s Communist Party views as national security offences are far broader and more sweeping, often ensnaring political criticism, dissent and even business activity that would not be criminalized elsewhere.
     
            They point to the application of national security laws in mainland China as well as in Hong Kong where a Beijing-imposed national security law has already transformed the once outspoken city since 2020, silencing almost all dissent and jailing dozens of political opponents. Many civil society groups have disbanded, and outspoken media outlets have shut down.
     
            The new draft Hong Kong law – known locally as Article 23 – is aimed at “filling the loopholes” left by the Beijing-imposed version enacted in 2020, according to the Hong Kong government.
     
            A previous attempt to pass Article 23 laws back in 2003 sparked huge protests and a government u-turn.
     
            But the atmosphere in Hong Kong this time around is very different.
     
            Many of the city’s leading pro-democracy figures are in jail either convicted or facing charges under the 2020 national security law.
     
            Others have fled overseas, and the city’s once raucous legislature has been cleared of pro-democracy opposition politicians, resembling instead the type of rubber stamp bodies favored by the Chinese Communist Party on the mainland.
     
            Public consultations for the new laws this time lasted 28 days, two months short of the time given during the earlier attempt in 2003 when hundreds of thousands of residents hit the streets in protest.
     
            The government said 98% of the 13,147 pieces of feedback it received during the consultation period “showed support” for the new law and just 0.7% voiced opposition, including a dozen from what it called “overseas anti-China organizations or abscondees.”
     
            Hong Kong’s legislature convened special sessions for the first and second reading of the proposed bill on Friday and within three hours after it was tabled.
     
            They were prompted by Hong Kong’s leader John Lee – a former police officer and security chief – who told lawmakers to pass the law “at full speed.”
     
            “Completing the legislative work even one day earlier means we can more effectively safeguard national security one day earlier,” he said in a letter to the legislature on Thursday.
     
            Authorities have yet to announce when a third reading will take place.
     
            Last month, the United States warned Article 23 risks “compounding the 2020 National Security Law that has curtailed the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong.”
     
            In a statement, the US Department of State said it was concerned by the “broad and vague definitions of ‘state secrets’ and ‘external interference,’” which could potentially be used to silence dissent, and some of the provisions that may have extraterritorial effects.

            No more face masks or social distancing rules. For the first time in four years, thousands of delegates attending China’s biggest political event of the year were able to mingle and sip tea like the old days in the sprawling foyer of Beijing’s Great Hall of the People.
     
            While some Covid testing requirements remain in place, on the surface, everything else seems back to pre-pandemic normal at the annual meetings of the rubber-stamp national legislature and China’s top political advisory body.
     
            But this year’s event also provides a fresh window into persisting controls and increasing opaqueness of the political system under leader Xi Jinping, who has prioritized security and strengthened the ruling Communist Party’s grip over everything – including the so-called “two sessions” itself.
     
            More than ever, Xi is looming large over the gathering, which had traditionally been a stage for the Chinese premier and the central government to shine.
     
            Beijing sent what observers say was a strong signal of that a day ahead of the opening of the National People’s Congress earlier this week – announcing that it was scrapping an annual press conference led by the premier – a three-decades-old political tradition that has long been a key landmark of the meeting, typically televised and highly anticipated.
     
            A government representative claimed the change was due to other opportunities for interviews.
     
            But observers saw one fewer chance for the world’s media, international observers, and Chinese citizens to get first-hand insight into the thinking of the country’s nominal No. 2 official, who is charged with running its economy – and one more move for Xi to cement his control over the official narrative.
     
            “The press conference is typically the only channel for any senior official in China to have a direct communication with the outside, especially with foreign media,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at City University of Hong Kong.
     
            “If you think about our image of past premiers, a lot of our understanding of their personality, reputation, authority is actually based on what they said in the press conference … removing this channel for the premier is consistent with the change that Xi Jinping is the only one that they want to signal to the outside (and) everyone else … is to some extent just a follower,” he said.
     
            While the press conferences themselves are carefully stage-managed, they have in the past provided moments for premiers to inject their own persona and views – or make departures from official lines, providing rare insight into thinking or even debates among China’s elite leaders.
     
            Former Premier Li Keqiang famously noted in his 2020 conference that, as Xi hailed China’s efforts in in poverty alleviation, 600 million people in the country still had a monthly income of just 1,000 yuan ($137).
     
            Current premier and Xi protégé Li Qiang, who was expected to lead the closing event this time, however, has not appeared to have such an inclination. He used his first and likely last press conference last year to highlight the prominence of the Communist Party over the state government.
     
            And on Tuesday, Li mentioned Xi’s name 16 times when delivering the government’s work report to delegates. “We owe our achievements in 2023 to General Secretary Xi Jinping, who is at the helm charting the course, and to the sound guidance of Xi Jinping Thought,” Li said.
     
            That only makes it all the more telling that the conference has been scrapped, especially in an environment when Beijing is aiming to bolster business confidence, observers say.

            “It is a gesture to show that the government cares about the perception of the outside and trying to establish an image of being open, being transparent,” said Liu in Hong Kong. “Keeping the press conference may not give us something new, but removing it is a bad signal … in terms of transparency and keeping outsiders confidence in China’s commitment to its opening up.”
     
            Changhao Wei, a fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center of Yale Law School, noted an NPC spokesperson had strongly implied that the premier’s presser wasn’t necessary because the news conferences attended by other government officials would be adequate substitutes.
     
            “I don’t find this reason particularly convincing because this year the NPC scheduled only 3 themed press conferences, compared to 13 themed press conferences in 2019 attended by not only administrative officials, but those from the courts and the legislature as well,” he said.
     
            The axing of the premier’s press conference came alongside a shortening of the “two sessions” overall – first imposed during the pandemic to prevent the spread of Covid.
     
            The move also reduces opportunities for journalists to ask questions of delegates or government officials, either in designated briefings or doorstepping them as they enter and exit the building.
     
            But even the nature of those encounters, which in recent decades saw reporters able to grab telling comments from officials, has changed – as delegates are widely seen by reporters as much less willing to say too much in the current political climate.
     
            Meanwhile, even as Covid-19 curbs were lessened, signs of heavy security, though typical for the “two sessions” period, were visible throughout the political heart of the city.
     
            For event attendees, usual security checks at certain entry points were augmented by facial recognition scanners that determined if people were cleared for entry.
     
            In Tiananmen Square’s subway stations and nearby streets, where security is tight regularly, police presence was heavy, with security vans parked roadside and officers holding muzzled police dogs monitoring crowds of people making their usual commutes.
     
            Traffic slowed due to checkpoints on surrounding streets, with security officials even stopping and checking IDs of some cyclists riding on a major throughfare along the square. In surrounding neighborhoods, red-clad community “volunteers” were also out in force keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity.
     
            Even mail was getting a stricter treatment, with China’s postal authority issuing a notice late last month outlining a system of double inspection for incoming packages during the two sessions period – with residents taking to social media to complain of delays.

            Tightened security is typical of the political gathering and many around the world – but apart from concerns about safety, Chinese authorities during major events are typically on high alert for showings of dissent and are known to ramp up repressive measures to ensure that dissidents or people petitioning the government stay silent.
     
            As public frustration mounts around financial hardships linked to an ailing economy – and the  Communist leadership seeks to block negative narratives and project confidence, officials this year may be particularly wary of any showing of discontent.
     
            Xi’s government already had to face large-scale demonstrations once – when rare protests broke out across the country in late 2022 as anger boiled over about on-going Covid-19 controls.
     
            That movement followed a single act of protest in Beijing before a major Communist Party meeting, when an unidentified person hung a banner from a highway bridge protesting Xi and his Covid-19 policies – prompting heighted security on overpasses throughout the city in its wake.
     
            Many measures around Tiananmen this week were expected to last only for the gathering.
     
            But when asked whether open access into an area near the square would return following the event’s close, one security guard responded: “you’ll have to see.”

            A flight in China was delayed by more than four hours on Wednesday after a passenger threw coins into the engine, according to Chinese state media.
     
            China Southern Airlines flight CZ8805 was originally scheduled to take off from the southern city of Sanya to Beijing around 10 a.m. local time on March 6, but it did not depart until around 2:16 p.m. local time, flight-tracking websites Flightradar24 and Flight Aware showed.
     
            In a video shared by multiple state media outlets, a flight attendant is seen questioning a passenger believed to have thrown the coins, asking them how many coins were thrown into the engine. The passenger, whose identity was not revealed in the video or by state media, can be heard on camera saying “three to five” coins.
     
            The passenger who allegedly threw the coins was later taken away by airport police, state media reported, citing Chinese Southern Airlines.
     
            The airline said coins were found during security checks, but did not specify how many were located.
     
            “The aircraft maintenance staff conducted a comprehensive safety inspection and determined that there were no safety issues before takeoff,” the airline’s customer service told state media.

            China Southern Airlines issued a warning against “uncivilized behaviors” on their official Chinese social media Weibo account on Wednesday, saying “throwing coins at the plane pose a threat to aviation safety and will result in different levels of punishment.” However, the post did not reference the incident directly.
     
            CNN has reached out to China Southern Airlines.
     
            Similar incidents of people throwing coins at planes, apparently for “good luck,” have occurred in recent years in China.
     
            Last October, a China Southern Airlines flight was delayed in Guangzhou after a passenger was observed throwing coins towards the plane. In 2021, a GX Airlines flight between Weifang and Haikou was canceled when several coins wrapped in red paper were discovered on the ground. And in 2017, an elderly passenger threw coins at a China Southern Airlines plane during boarding at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport, claiming it was “a prayer for a safe flight.”

            China registered a surprise jump in foreign trade at the start of the year, partly because of strong demand from Russia, India and emerging markets in Africa and Latin America.
     
            Exports from the world’s second largest economy rose by 7.1% in the January-to-February period, beating the 1.9% growth forecast by a Reuters poll of economists. The growth is also significantly higher than the 2.3% gains recorded in December.
     
            China typically reports economic data for the first two months of the year together to avoid any distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday.
     
            Imports also beat expectations, up 3.5% from a year ago, while the trade surplus reached $125.2 billion, about 7% higher than the same period last year.
     
            China’s economy is battling a number of headwinds, including weak consumer and investor confidence, high youth unemployment and a long-running real estate crisis. The turnaround in trade — a year ago it was shrinking — is a rare bright spot in a gloomy picture.
     
            Apart from the weak base effect, strong demand from emerging markets helped China’s trade surge at the start of the year. Shipments to Africa, Latin America, and India rose by 21%, 20.6%, and 12.8% respectively.
     
            “While the strong export growth to India may reflect more its strong domestic economy, exports to Africa and LatA﻿m could indicate growing trade ties between China and these emerging economies, amid a broad global geopolitical shift,” said Nomura analysts on Thursday.
     
            India is the world’s fastest growing major economy, and its government expects it to expand by 7.6% this year.
     
            Meanwhile, China’s exports to Russia increased 12.5%, representing a slowdown from the rapid growth seen last year. Moscow became China’s 10th-largest trading partner last year, with a record $240 billion worth of goods shipped between the two countries. At the start of 2024, it slipped to the 11th spot.
     
            “China’s exports to Russia are unlikely to surge again in the near term to levels on par with those in 2023, due mainly to a high base and limited space for Chinese exporters to further expand their market shares in Russia,” said Nomura analysts on Thursday.
     
            China’s shipments to the United States also increased, up 5% from a year earlier. But its exports to other traditional trading partners, such as the European Union, Japan, and Australia, registered declines.
     
            Analysts are cautious about the outlook of the trade sector.
     
            “At the current juncture, it is likely too soon to call for a revival in China’s trade sector,” said HSBC analysts on Thursday.
     
            “We hold the view that trade uncertainty is likely to persist as global growth may still [be] soft amid high interest rates.”
     
            Trade restrictions against China might also hamper growth later this year, said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
     
            In October, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicle imports into the bloc. The Biden administration has also been discussing raising tariffs on some Chinese goods, including EVs, the Wall Street Journal reported in December, citing anonymous sources.
     
            Wang Wentao, the country’s commerce minister, said Wednesday at a press conference that foreign trade might face a severe situation this year amid weak international demand and trade protectionist measures globally.

            It’s about to get easier for some foreign travelers to visit China, with the government announcing plans to extend its visa exemption policy to six additional European countries.
     
            The exemption will take effect on March 14, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced on Thursday during a press conference on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress meeting in Beijing.
     
            “I wish to share with you that starting from March 14, China will further extend, on a pilot basis, visa exemption to six countries, including Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg,” Wang said.
     
            Visa exemptions for Switzerland and Ireland passport holders were both announced in January when Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited both countries, according to Chinese state media reports, with the other countries listed by Wang being the latest additions.
     
            “We hope more countries will offer Chinese citizens visa exempt visa facilitation and work with us to build fast track networks for cross border travels and encourage speedy resumption of international passenger flights,” Wang said, adding this “will make it more convenient for Chinese citizens to travel abroad and make foreign friends feel at home in China.”

Number of foreign visitors to China in 2023 down more than 60% from pre-pandemic levels
 
            China’s recent moves to make it easier for travelers from certain countries to visit are part of efforts to boost foreign tourism as its economy struggles to recover.
     
            In January, China signed a reciprocal agreement with Thailand and Singapore to permanently waive tourist visa requirements for each other’s citizens from March. In November last year, China announced a trial program to allow visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia to enter visa-free for 15 days.
     
            Though US travelers still need a tourist visa to enter China, restrictions have been eased and they no longer have to submit proof of a round-trip flight booking, a hotel reservation, an organized itinerary or a letter of invitation as of January 1, 2024.
     
            The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the newly relaxed guidelines on December 29, 2023, citing the desire “to further facilitate people-to-people exchanges.”
     
            Foreign travelers have been slow to return to the country, with 2023 arrival numbers down more than 60% from pre-pandemic levels.
     
            China’s border authorities recorded 35.5 million entries and exits by foreign nationals last year, according to the National Immigration Administration. That’s nearly seven times more than the number from 2022, when the country was deep in its three-year self-imposed Covid isolation.
     
            The 2023 figure is just 36% of the 97.7 million border entries and exits by foreign nationals recorded in 2019, suggesting a long road to full recovery, though momentum picked up toward the end of the year.

China’s top diplomat hit out at Washington’s “bewildering” trade policy during a news conference Thursday on the sidelines of a political gathering in Beijing, where Chinese leaders have been championing high-tech development in the face of mounting curbs from Washington.
     
            Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the US of “devising various tactics to suppress China” and said Washington’s “lengthening” unilateral sanctions list had reached “bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity.”
     
            “If it gets jittery whenever it hears the word China, where is its confidence as a major country?” Wang said in a response to a question about trade with the US and technological restrictions.
     
            “If it only wants itself to prosper, but denies other countries legitimate development, where is international fairness? If it persistently monopolizes the high end of the value chain and keeps China at the low end, where is fairness and competition?”
     
            Wang made the comments during an annual Foreign Minister’s briefing held during each “two sessions” gathering of China’s rubber stamp legislature and its top political advisory body. Though highly choreographed, the more than hour-long engagement is a key opportunity for China’s top diplomat to express the country’s foreign policy vision directly to reporters from media around the world.
     
            In a stark contrast to his comments on the US, Wang praised China’s burgeoning relationship and record trade with Russia – highlighting this near the top of his press conference when a Russian state media reporter was the first question taken from a foreign reporter.
     
            Wang’s comments on the US come as Washington continues its drive to narrow the kinds of high-end technology that can be accessed by China. In October, the White House further reduced the types of semiconductors that US companies can sell in China as it aims to ensure American tech won’t be used to bolster the Chinese military.
     
            The US has also enacted sanctions against Chinese actors over a host of issues in recent years, including allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the illicit fentanyl trade and providing support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

‘Two sessions’: China scraps a decades-long political tradition as Xi tightens control amid economic woes
 
            Wang spoke during what has been a period of relative stability between the China and the US. Adopting a softer tone at times, Wang noted that there had been “some improvements” in the US-China relationship since a summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco last November.
     
            He called on Washington to work with Beijing “to bring the relationship back on the track of stable, sound and sustainable development.”
     
            What has been on the agenda at the meetings this week is China’s drive to bolster its “self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” with Beijing sending a message that it will boost its self-reliance rather than sit back and wait for tech frictions with the US to improve.
     
            The government announced plans to increase its annual budget for science and technology by 10% to an unprecedented 370.8 billion yuan ($51.6 billion) — the biggest jump since 2019 after years of minimal growth.
     
            Wang also praised robust trade ties between China and Russia, which have deepened following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent economic isolation on the global stage.
     
            Bilateral trade between China and Russia hit a historic $240 billion last year, surpassing a target of $200 billion set by Xi and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in 2019 ahead of schedule.
     
            “Russian natural gas is fueling numerous Chinese households and Chinese-made automobiles are running on Russian roads,” Wang said. “All this shows the strong resilience and broad prospects of China-Russia mutually beneficial cooperation.”

The dangerous parallels between Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine and Xi’s claims on Taiwan
 
            Beijing’s ties to Moscow have sparked deep suspicion in the West, including over concerns about China’s position as the Kremlin’s key economic lifeline. While China claims neutrality in the Ukraine conflict it has appeared unwilling to use its significant economic leverage to curb Russia’s aggression and has not condemned the invasion.
     
            During the briefing, Wang repeated China’s call for peace talks to avoid an “unthinkable” escalation and deterioration of the conflict. He also reiterated past rhetoric framing China’s relationship with Russia as a responsible one.
     
            Maintaining and growing the China-Russia relationship is a “strategic choice” by the two sides based on their fundamental interests and is also “what we must do to keep pace with the trend of the world,” Wang said.
     
            “China and Russia have forged a new paradigm of major country relations that differs entirely from the obsolete Cold War approach on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party,” he added.
     
            The diplomat also addressed simmering tensions in the disputed South China Sea where non-lethal but increasingly tense clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in recent months have raised concerns about the risk of conflict, which could then embroil the United States, a Philippine mutual defense ally.
     
            Those flared again Tuesday when the Philippines Coast Guard accused Chinese vessels of executing “dangerous maneuvers” to impede and obstruct a resupply mission in contested waters in the South China Sea.
     
            CNN reporters were on board one of the Philippine Coast Guard vessels and witnessed how a much larger force of Chinese coast guard ships and boats from its shadowy “maritime militia” penned in a smaller convoy of Philippine vessels resupplying a remote military outpost.

            Despite an international tribunal rejecting China’s claim of historic rights to the bulk of the sea, it has continued to militarize islands and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels to enforce its claims.
     
            “In the face of deliberate infringement, we will take justified actions to defend our rights in accordance with the law. In the face of unwarranted provocation, we will respond with prompt and legitimate countermeasures,” Wang said Thursday.
     
            “We also urge certain countries outside the region, not to make provocations, excite or stir up troubles,” he said, in an apparent jab at the US presence in the region.
     
            The foreign minister’s comments on Taiwan also caught the notice of those closely watching for any evolution of Chinese policy on Taiwan during the “two sessions” meeting.
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its territory, despite never having controlled it. It has not ruled out the use of force to retake the island, which maintains close unofficial ties with the US.
     
            Some observers had noted that a line in a report delivered by Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday proclaimed that China would advance the cause of “China’s reunification” instead of saying “peaceful reunification” as it has been written at times in the past.
     
            On Thursday, when responding to a question about Taiwan’s recent election of Lai Ching-te, whose party views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation under threat from China, Wang specifically called for the support of “peaceful reunification.”
     
            He also reiterated staid language that “whoever in the world” supports Taiwan independence will get “burned for playing with fire.”

            As dawn slowly broke on the horizon, a large fleet of Chinese vessels came into view from the deck of a Philippine Coast Guard ship as it entered the contested waters of the South China Sea.
     
            Significantly outnumbered by the number of Chinese vessels, the four ships in the Philippine convoy on a resupply mission to troops were quickly surrounded and separated during a frantic high seas skirmish on Tuesday morning.
     
            Within just a few hours, the window of one Philippine boat would be shattered by water cannon and four sailors aboard would be injured.
     
            China’s determination to assert its disputed sovereignty over the entirety of the vast South China Sea has sparked increasing clashes with its neighbors in recent years, particularly the Philippines, which is a mutual defense ally of the United States.
     
            But what CNN journalists on board the Philippine Coast Guard vessel on Tuesday witnessed was one of the most severe confrontations to date — and a vivid illustration of how this David versus Goliath struggle in one of the world’s busiest shipping waterways could spiral into the next global conflict.
 
            The Philippine ship tried to find safe passage through myriad China Coast Guard ships as well as fishing vessels that form part of China’s shadowy “maritime militia” blocking their path.
     
            The Philippines accused the China Coast Guard ships of colliding with two of their vessels, causing damage to their exteriors. One of the smaller Philippine boats was also hit by water cannons from two Chinese vessels, shattering the windshield and leaving the crew on board with injuries.
     
            China countered that its coast guard vessels “took control measures” against Philippine ships that it claimed “illegally intruded” into its sovereign territory. It said the damaged Philippine ship ignored repeated warnings and “deliberately rammed” into a China Coast Guard vessel in what it said was an “unprofessional and dangerous manner.”
     
            CNN joined the Philippine Coast Guard for two days, the first time foreign journalists have been allowed to embed with the fleet in decades.
     
            Their mission was to resupply a small group of marines living on a World War II-era ship grounded on an obscure contested reef.

            Missions like this have become one of the most regular causes of direct confrontations between the Philippines and its giant neighbor China, which has built up the world’s largest navy. What happens among the tiny islands, reefs and atolls of this corner of the globe could have profound international repercussions and become a major global flashpoint.
     
            Departing the sleepy port of Bulilyan on the southern tip of the Philippines’ Palawan Island, two Philippine Coast Guard ships embarked on a 13-hour overnight journey north to the Sabina Shoal, where they met up with two smaller resupply vessels staffed by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, transporting food, water and other essentials.
     
            The coast guard ships then tried to escort the smaller vessels as they navigated the disputed waters on a four-hour steam toward the next location.
     
            Their target was the Sierra Madre, a rusted ship that rests on a strategically vital shoal that has become the epicenter of this simmering confrontation.
     
            The US-built Philippine Navy landing craft was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board. Since then, rotating detachments of Filipino marines have been living on board, hunkering down through tropical heat, typhoons and long spells away from home in a bid to assert territorial rights and prevent any Chinese development there.
     
            The vessel rests atop a contested reef, which even has a name that is under dispute. Though internationally known as the Second Thomas Shoal, the Philippines call the reef Ayungin Shoal, and China refers to it as Ren’ai Jiao.
     
            The teardrop-shaped reef forms part of the contested Spratly islands – which are all claimed by China. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made territorial claims to some of the shoals.
     
            During the confrontation, Filipino crews counted a total of five China Coast Guard vessels, 18 boats belonging to Beijing’s “maritime militia” – and at a further distance, two Chinese naval vessels and a military helicopter, said Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela on Wednesday.
     
            “The Philippines is solely responsible for this,” China’s Coast Guard said. “The Philippines is dishonest in its statements, deliberately stirs up trouble, maliciously incites and sensationalizes, and continues to undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea region.”
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry has lodged a solemn representation with the Philippines to extend its “strongest protest,” spokesperson Mao Ning said in a regular press briefing Tuesday.
     
            In December, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson accused the Philippines of making repeated provocations and infringing on China’s sovereignty. Earlier in 2023, China also accused the Philippines of attempting to deliver “construction materials” to reinforce the Sierra Madre, which meant “the Chinese side was made to respond with necessary moves” adding that the China Coast Guard “took warning law enforcement measures.”
     
            At first glance it’s hard to imagine why these remote, unpopulated reefs and atolls are so hotly contested – but they lie in a strategic location in Asia’s main shipping lane, which has more than $3.4 trillion in trade passing through it every year, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) China Power Project.
     
            Over the last few decades, China has built up tiny reefs and sandbars far from its shores across the waterway into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.
     
            The Philippines says the development of Mischief Reef, close to Second Thomas Shoal, was what originally prompted them to ground the Sierra Madre.
     
            In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China’s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis.
     
            But Beijing has rejected the tribunal’s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China’s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels – which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors.
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry has long defended the behavior of its vessels in the South China Sea and said Beijing will “firmly safeguard” what it views as its territorial sovereignty. It insists that the Philippines is illegally occupying the Second Thomas Shoal.
     
            The US military also maintains a regular presence in the South China Sea, with aircraft overflights, so-called “freedom of navigation” operations, and patrols and exercises with allies and partners to assert that the South China Sea is an international waterway.

CNN took an 11-day cruise through some of the most-contested waters on Earth. Here’s what we learned
 
            Since his election in 2021, Philippines President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., has taken a stronger line against China, in a departure from the foreign policy approach of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who trod much more softly with Beijing in return for economic cooperation.
     
            Last week, Marcos Jr. told Australian lawmakers that his country is on the “front line” of maritime disputes and “will not yield” an inch of territory.
     
            The Philippines ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel Romualdez, also said last week that the South China Sea - not Taiwan - is the “real flashpoint” for an armed conflict in the region, and warned that “all hell breaks loose” if Washington decides to invoke its mutual defense treaty to protect Manila, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency.
 
            Diplomacy has taken place between the two sides, with a bilateral meeting held in Shanghai between China and the Philippines late January and both sides agreeing to calm tensions and find ways to communicate over their differences.
     
            But the reality out at sea is quite different.
     
            For the Filipinos who conduct this resupply mission every month, the maritime confrontations with China have become routine.
     
            The missions are exhausting and dangerous, and often carried out in sweltering temperatures, but there’s a sense of pride among the crew, who believe they are trying to protect their nation’s territory. They call themselves “Coast Guardians.”
     
            The Japanese-built BRP Camra MRRV 4409 Coast Guard vessel – the ship which CNN joined - was previously water cannoned by the China Coast Guard, and it was involved in a collision with a Chinese fishing vessel.
     
            On Tuesday, CNN witnessed Chinese ships carrying out several risky maneuvers around the vessel, including a China Coast Guard ship which stopped right in front of the Camra’s path, and also steamed past dangerously close to the starboard side of the vessel. Large “maritime militia” vessels also sailed within a few meters of the Camra.
     
            Tarriela, the Coast Guard spokesperson, said a China Coast Guard vessel had come within 20 yards (60 feet) of the Cabra.
     
            The ship has 23 crew on board this deployment, some of whom told CNN that they had been on a years-long deployment on this ship, working 12-hour days for two months straight, then taking a month off back on shore with their families.
     
            Under conditions imposed by the Philippine Coast Guard, CNN was unable to speak on record to any crew members.
     
            The women and the officers on board stay in bunk rooms, and the rest of the crew sleep in a communal room below deck, which also doubles up as the dining hall – unfortunately making it a favorite spot for cockroaches.
     
            But the living conditions on the coast guard vessel are still far better than on the wreck of the Sierra Madre.
     
            A decade ago, former CNN journalist Tomas Etzler traveled out to the shoal and stayed with the marines on the rusting ruin of the rat- and roach-infested vessel.
     
            They caught their own fish and cooked them on board for most of their meals, and they tried to create a makeshift gym using random items on the deck as weights.
     
            To make their time a little easier, care packages are sometimes airdropped into the ocean – in 2014, that included letters of support from schoolchildren, and fried chicken from the Philippine fast food institution Jollibee.
     
            The marines, who usually carry out a 90-day deployment on the ship, are sometimes rotated out during the resupply missions at sea – with a successful rotation carried out on Tuesday, said Tarriela.
     
            During the mission, only one of the two resupply boats successfully made it to the Sierra Madre due to the Chinese maritime blockade, reducing their supplies until next month’s attempted mission – which will likely face the same confrontations with China. Still, the fact that they managed to deliver supplies at all made the trip “a success,” Tarriela said.

Tensions are flaring once more in the South China Sea. Here’s why it matters for the world
 
            A US warship, the USS Mobile, was spotted on the Philippine crews’ journey out on Monday evening, ahead of the confrontation with Beijing, said Tarriela. However, he said, the Philippines did not coordinate with the US during the operation.
     
            After the clash on Tuesday, the US released a statement saying it “stands with our ally the Philippines following (China’s) provocative actions against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea on March 5.”
     
            It also pointed to its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, which it said “extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in the South China Sea.”
     
            Analysts say China employs “gray zone” tactics around Second Thomas shoal, carrying out actions just below what might be considered acts of war but that achieve the same result: Beijing gaining territory or control without firing a shot.

            But Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said it may be time for the US to reevaluate what constitutes an act of war after watching the video of the water cannon smashing the Philippine vessel’s windows.
     
            “Without clarifying what ‘armed attack’ constitutes, this episode will keep recurring since Beijing senses impunity,” Koh said.
     
            Ray Powell, director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University, said the onus is on Philippine partners and allies, like the US, to take new actions to push back on China.
     
            “Will the US, its allies, other members of the international community, will they get together and say something more than finger-wagging has to happen here?” Powell said.
     
            “Because we’ve tried that, and it doesn’t seem to be discouraging or deterring China at all.”

            Maldives on Tuesday said China will provide it with “military assistance,” in the latest sign that the Indian Ocean archipelago’s pro-China shift is well under way following the election of President Mohamed Muizzu last year.
     
            The Maldivian Defense Ministry said it signed an agreement with Beijing Monday “on China’s provision of military assistance” and that the deal would foster “stronger bilateral ties,” according to a post on social media site X.
     
            Details of what the assistance would entail were not released but the ministry said the deal was “gratis” — or given for free.
     
            The move is part of a push by President Muizzu since taking office in November to develop closer relations with China, following his “India Out” election campaign that promised to remove Indian troops from Maldivian soil and reassert “lost” national sovereignty.
     
            In January, Muizzu set a deadline of March 15 for the complete withdrawal of Indian military personnel stationed in the archipelago nation, according to the president’s office. An update from his office last month said negotiations had agreed troops would leave in stages, with the first withdrawing before March 10 and the rest before May 10.
     
            According to Reuters, there are 77 Indian soldiers and 12 medical personnel from the Indian armed forces in Maldives. India has also given Maldives two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft, which are mainly used for marine surveillance, search and rescue operations and medical evacuations, Reuters reported.
     
            The new deal with China marks a significant shift in Maldives’ foreign policy from Muizzu’s pro-India predecessor, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.
     
            The tiny South Asian nation is regarded internationally as a tourist destination popular for its white sand beaches and turquoise lagoons.
     
            But the archipelago of nearly 1,200 low-lying coral islands, with a population of fewer than half a million people, spreads over a swathe of strategically important waters and shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean.
     
            Given their geographic proximity and strong historic and economic ties, India was for decades Maldives’ closest partner and New Delhi viewed the region as part of its traditional sphere of influence.

            But Maldives has long found itself in the middle of a geopolitical tussle with both India and China vying for influence.
     
            China has increasingly expanded its footprint in Maldives, most visibly through large-scale infrastructure projects such as the $200 million China-Maldives Friendship Bridge.
     
            Analysts have previously told CNN that a Chinese presence in Maldives could affect Indian security, given the island chain’s proximity to India’s western coast.
     
            In January, Muizzu traveled to Beijing for a state visit and the two countries signed 20 agreements that included cooperation on infrastructure, trade, economy, green development, grants, and other development projects.
     
            That includes about $127 million in aid to develop roads in the capital Male and build 30,000 social housing units, according to a news release from the president’s office.
     
            During the trip, Muizzu hailed China as “one of the closest allies and developmental partners of Maldives.”
     
            China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Tuesday that Beijing is “committed to working with the Maldives to build a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.”
     
            “Normal cooperation between China and the Maldives does not target any third party and will not be disrupted by any third party,” she said.
     
            In his presidential address on February 5, Muizzu said Maldives must fortify its military capabilities and its defense force was about to achieve round-the-clock surveillance capabilities over the nation’s 900,000 square kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone.
     
            The government will also not renew an agreement that enables foreign countries to measure and map the oceans and coasts of Maldives, he said.

            Hot Stocks 


 
            iPhone sales dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report, adding to significant problems for Apple and other Western tech companies in a crucial market.
     
            Analysts from Counterpoint Research said the overall mobile market in China fell by 7% with companies including Apple, Oppo and Vivo experiencing declines.
     
            But the problem for Apple has been ongoing for a year as China’s economy slows down, and trade tensions and nationalism heat up. Customers that once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands, particularly Huawei, Counterpoint said.
     
            “Primarily, [Apple] faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi,” Mengmeng Zhang, a Counterpoint senior analyst, said in a press release. “Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now.”
     
            Apple shares slid 2.8% on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 11.6% this year on concerns about weakening sales, particularly in China.
     
            The company did not respond to a request for comment.
     
            The report comes amid a floundering Chinese economy, a struggling housing market, higher unemployment of younger workers and more competition among higher-end vendors in China, particularly from Chinese device manufacturer Huawei.
     
            China remains a very important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. Apple previously made a lot of gains during its launch period last year. The company continues to offer discounts to help ameliorate some of the downturn.
     
            Last year, Huawei’s Mate 60 made headlines when the US government sought more information about the Pro model which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.
     
            Now, some Chinese consumers think they’ve been wronged by the US government sanctions and are gravitating toward Huawei’s Mate 60 smartphone, which is edging into Apple volumes.
     
            Jeff Fieldhack, a research director with Counterpoint, told CNN part of the issue is that Apple had a strong January last year due to part shortages, but didn’t experience shortages in January this year.
     
            “This isn’t a major deal for Apple in the long term,” he said. “It is still a successful iPhone launch and there is more discounting and marketing they can do this year in China to help alleviate the competition from Huawei.”
     
            Huawei in January represented 17% of the mobile market share in China, compared to Apple’s 16% share. Huawei demand is higher than its supply, which means it could in theory be selling more, Fieldhack added.
     
            “Apple, to its credit, ended the year at number one, which was extraordinary despite headwinds from China,” he said.

China has set an ambitious economic expansion target of “around 5%“ for 2024, as its leaders vowed to “transform the growth model” in the face of significant challenges facing its development.
     
            The figure — similar to last year’s growth target — was announced by Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday at the opening of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, which draws nearly 3,000 delegates to Beijing for a week-long meeting.
     
            “Stability is of overall importance, as it is the basis for everything we do,” Li said during the delivery of his maiden work report. “In particular, we must push ahead with transforming the growth model, making structural adjustments, improving quality, and enhancing performance.”
     
            Li’s proclamation comes as Beijing is seeking to boost confidence in China’s economy, while grappling with a troubled property sector, deflationary pressures, an exodus of foreign capital, a battered stock market and a record low birth rate.
     
             He delivered the report to an auditorium filled with delegates inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People. Delegates clapped in unison in time with a military band serenade as top leadership entered the room in a line led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
     
            The political heart of Beijing, where the event is taking place, was under heavy security ahead of the event, with barricades and traffic controls restricting access to the public square and surrounding government buildings.
     
            At the event, China also unveiled its annual military budget for 2024, which will increase by 7.2% to 1.67 trillion yuan ($230.6 billion), according to a draft report released separately. The growth rate for the defense budget is the same as last year’s.
     
            The gross domestic product (GDP) target and military spending are among the most closely watched figures during the opening day of proceedings.
     
            But investors appear to be disappointed about the lack of major stimulus measures. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.6% by afternoon trade, the worst performer in Asia. The Hang Seng Tech Index sank 4%.
     
            A target of “around 5%” is ambitious but achievable, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group.
     
            “(It) entails more aggressive easing measures than last year. As a result, it may also improve the growth outlook among households and corporates,” he said.
     
            Last year, China also set an “around 5%” target, in what was then the country’s lowest numerical target announced in decades. Earlier this year, it said economic growth had reached 5.2% in 2023.
     
            Meeting a similar target in the coming year, however, could be significantly tougher. In 2022, Covid-19 restrictions in the country were rampant, setting a low base of comparison for last year. Some international analysts are also skeptical about the reliability of China’s growth figures, as the government is widely seen as having limited data transparency.
     
            Premier Li admitted that achieving the growth targets “will not be easy.”
     
            “In setting the growth rate at around 5%, we have taken into account the need to boost employment and incomes and prevent and defuse risks,” he added.

China is one of world’s most expensive places to raise children, report finds
 
            China’s economic challenges have generated hardship and frustration as young people struggle to find jobs, investors grapple with market losses and small business owners fight to stay afloat.
     
            No major stimulus measures were announced, but Li said the government would “stabilize and expand” consumption, while targeting an increase in spending on big-ticket items including electronics and new-energy vehicles.
     
            The government set the fiscal budget deficit at 3% of GDP for 2024. This is lower than the revised deficit of 3.8% in 2023, but the same as the 3% target initially announced last year.
     
            The target may indicate Beijing’s caution over debt sustainability, as policymakers  try to strike a balance between stabilizing growth and controlling debt, analysts said. In December, Moody’s downgraded China’s credit rating outlook from “stable” to “negative,” citing risks from financially stressed local governments and state-owned enterprises.
     
            To boost government spending for major projects, Li announced a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($139 billion) of ultra-long special central government bonds this year, the first such sale since 2020. 
 
            Local governments will also be allowed to issue 3.9 trillion yuan ($542 billion) of special bonds, which would be mainly used for infrastructure spending. That’s an increase of 100 billion yuan ($13.9 billion) from last year. 
     
            “The NPC did not bring any major surprises to investors but raised doubts about achieving the ambitious 5% growth target without the increasing fiscal deficit ratio,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank. “While the total increase in 1.1 trillion yuan bond issuances provides extra funding to bolster infrastructure investments, there is no big stimulus plan to support growth.”
     
            Recent years have seen national security interests, Covid-19 controls and efforts to tighten government control over industries like technology, entertainment and real estate all take priority for Xi — at times over business growth and economic expansion.
     
            Li also appeared to nod to criticism that China had gone too far toward prioritizing national security at the cost of economic growth, calling for the country to “ensure that high-quality development and greater security reinforce each other.”
     
            As part of its strategic goals, China boosted its annual budget for science and technology by 10% to an unprecedented 370.8 billion yuan ($51.6 billion) — the biggest increase since 2019 after years of minimal growth.
     
            “We will move faster to boost self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” Li said. “We will fully leverage the strengths of the new system for mobilizing resources nationwide to raise China’s capacity for innovation across the board.”
     
            Li also vowed to bolster efforts in big data and artificial intelligence (AI) and launch a number of major science and technology programs.
     
            The emphasis on self-reliance in science and technology comes after the United States tightened control over the export of cutting-edge technologies to China, especially in the field of AI, which Washington said could be used to strengthen the Chinese military.
     
            The Biden administration has restricted American companies from selling advanced semiconductor chips to China and banned US investment in China in sensitive technologies including AI, quantum computing and semiconductors.
     
            China’s 7.2% growth rate in military spending is in line with several previous years of similar single-digit increases.
     
            Beijing hasn’t announced double digit growth in military spending since 2015, when there was a push to revamp the armed forces.
     
            Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, said that given China’s economic slowdown, a 7.2% increase is fairly significant.
     
            “The overall percentage of defense spending in GDP is still smaller than those of the US and Russia, but the ratio is nevertheless growing,” she said.
     
            The US authorized an $886 billion defense budget for 2024, up about 3% from the previous year.
     
            The expansion of China’s defense budget has outpaced its target economic growth for years, with this year being no exception.
     
            Nevertheless, it has not reached the stage where it is overburdening the national coffers, said James Char, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and an expert on the Chinese military.
     
            “Of course, the country’s longer-term economic fortunes will determine whether this can be sustained going forward,” he said.
     
            China’s leaders are watching what they see as an increasingly fractious geopolitical environment, ranging from America’s closer alliances with Beijing’s neighbors, growing friction with the Philippines over contested South China Sea waters and rising tension globally amid major conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.
     
            Beijing has repeatedly pushed back against characterizations that it is aggressively ramping up military spending. Rather, it seeks to project an image of itself as a proponent of peace, despite its own aggression in places like the South China Sea and toward the self-ruled island of Taiwan.

Xi’s latest purge targets the military. Why did powerful generals fall out of favor?
 
            NPC spokesperson Lou Qinjian told reporters in Beijing on Monday that “compared with major military powers, such as the United States, China’s defense spending is quite low, whether as a percentage of GDP or total budget, or in terms of per citizen or per service member expenditure.”
     
            Outside estimates in recent years have suggested higher actual spending than official figures indicate. The official figure does not include a breakdown of military spending, making it difficult to make direct comparisons.
     
            China’s military has also had a tumultuous year.
     
            Multiple high-ranking officials and defense executives were removed from their positions either in the armed forces or political bodies in recent months alongside an anti-corruption drive and apparent purge. Those ousted included then-Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who was removed from his post without explanation.
     
            The fallout has been felt at the NPC.
     
            Last week, Lt. Gen. Li Zhizhong, the deputy commander of the Central Theater Command, was removed as a member of the congress. He formerly served as the head of the equipment department of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Ground Force and was the tenth senior PLA officer to have been ousted from the legislative body in recent months.
     
            And since December, four senior figures in the defense industry have been dismissed from the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body to the congress.
     
            “If our assumptions about extensive corruption and wastage in China’s military-industrial complex are correct, the PLA high command will likely prioritize the imposition of tighter resource management above all else,” Char said.

            Thousands of delegates from across China are gathering in Beijing this week for the start of the country’s most prominent annual political event, where leaders will signal how they plan to steer the world’s second largest economy in the year ahead — and try to dispel deepening concern about the challenges it faces.
     
            Projecting confidence is likely to be high on the agenda for Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his top Communist Party officials during the days-long, highly choreographed event, known as the “two sessions,” when China’s rubber stamp legislature and top advisory body convene.
     
            The largely ceremonial gathering is taking on heightened importance this year as China’s economy has been roiled by a property sector crisis, hefty local government debt, deflation, a stock market rout and tech friction with the US — all fueling questions about whether the country will lose steam before it reaches its goal of becoming a developed global power.
     
            It also will include a significant break with precedent: the scrapping of a closing press conference with China’s premier, a political tradition that has featured in the gathering for three decades – at a times providing a rare window into the thinking of China’s number two leader, who is nominally in charge of the economy.
     
            The press conference would also not take place for the rest of the current five year political cycle “unless there are very special circumstances,” spokesperson Lou Qinjian told reporters in Beijing Monday ahead of the legislative meeting’s opening day, citing other interview opportunities for media throughout the event. This year’s legislative gathering will also last just seven days, a shorter format than was typical prior to the pandemic.
     
            The changes are likely to add to broader concerns about transparency around China’s policymaking and further dim the premier’s profile, which had already been impacted by Xi’s hardline control over all policy areas, including the economy. Under Xi, the premier and the State Council, which functions as China’s cabinet, have been increasingly sidelined.
     
            “By design, they only want one voice — from the (Communist) Party. They don’t want other voices to dilute the voice of the party, which is controlled by Xi,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
     
            That also means Xi is heavily under the spotlight as economic pain has sparked growing frustration within China. The gathering comes one year after he began a norm-shattering third term as president, having consolidated power atop the party and stacked its leadership with a raft of officials who appeared to be selected for their loyalty as much as experience.
     
            A year later — as an expected post-Covid recovery has yet to fully materialize, young people struggle to find jobs, investors grapple with market losses and small business owners fight to stay afloat — skepticism has been rising about the direction charted by the leader and his new team. Xi has also overseen a political shakeup in his own ranks, further marring the start of the new term.
     
            Those challenges may not pose a threat to Xi, who is China’s most powerful and authoritative leader in decades. But how his team addresses those concerns will have implications not only for the future of China and its 1.4 billion people, but the global economy at large — and Xi’s top officials are likely stepping into the meeting feeling that pressure.
     
            Policymakers, investors and business owners in capitals across the world will also be watching closely, especially in a year when America’s presidential election could further strain the relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
     
            “The government wants to use this platform to send signals that China’s economy in general is okay and is on the right trajectory,” said Chen Gang, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute.
     
            “Now there are a lot of doubts and suspicions about the capacity of the new administration … (so) they want to showcase that this government, the new administration led by (Xi’s number two) Premier Li Qiang, is capable of handling economic issues,” he said.
     
            The gathering, which takes place in Beijing’s cavernous Great Hall of the People, is the only time each year that the nearly 3,000-person legislature, the National People’s Congress, meets in person.
     
            The body has little power to chart the course ahead for the country, as major policy direction is set by the party, whose elite members make decisions in closed-door meetings throughout the year.
     
            But the two sessions provide an important platform for China’s notoriously opaque government to broadcast its strategy for economic, social and foreign policies and announce key indicators including China’s economic growth target, its budget deficit limit and military spending for the coming year.
     
            It’s also an opportunity for elite leaders to hear from delegates, who hail from across the country and different social sectors — though the space for such exchanges at the gathering and in general has shrunk as Xi has tightened ideological control and overseen a drive to crush views that deviate from the Communist Party line.

            Such controls have also appeared in recent debate about the economy, with some prominent economic analysts subjected to social media restrictions that seem designed to restrict their ability to speak out.
     
            “The regime often utilizes the annual conference to secure support from Chinese society and bolster confidence in the market,” said Xuezhi Guo, a professor of political science at Guilford College in the US.
     
            Now “this is particularly crucial given challenges like China’s real estate downturn, stock market crisis, high unemployment, and weakened demand,” he said.
     
            Observers will be parsing how leaders discuss or comment on key issues like China’s position on the self-governing island of Taiwan, its relations with the US and bid to strengthen innovation as Washington bolsters tech export controls.
     
            “It is conceivable that Xi may adopt a more conciliatory stance towards the US, temporarily shelving the confrontational ‘wolf warrior diplomacy,’ and redirecting efforts towards supporting both the bureaucracy and technocrats to ensure stability in China’s economy,” said Guo.
     
            Such a tone shift could also be signaled by the appointment of a new foreign minister at this year’s gathering – something analysts ahead of the gathering said could happen in the coming days, though an agenda of the event announced Monday did not mention personnel changes.
     
            The role has been filled, in what many expected to be a temporary capacity, by senior diplomat and former Foreign Minister Wang Yi since July, when his newly appointed successor Qin Gang was ousted without explanation after disappearing from public view.
     
            That dramatic moment was followed just weeks later by the disappearance and subsequent removal and replacement of another of Xi’s hand-picked, third-term officials: then Defense Minister Li Shangfu. Again, it was done without explanation alongside an anti-corruption drive and apparent purge within China’s military.
     
            While analysts said the surprise shake-up wasn’t a threat to Xi’s iron-clad grip on power, it did raise questions about his judgment, with lingering vacancies from those removals still a reminder of that.
     
            Besides the foreign minister role, two high-ranking posts in China’s cabinet previously occupied by Li and Qin also remain open.
     
            Signs leading up to the gathering suggest the Chinese government is gearing up to focus on supporting economic growth in the year ahead, but it’s unlikely China will unveil any major stimulus.
     
            “Beijing will likely use the two sessions to announce tactical measures aimed at boosting short-term confidence in China’s economy but without changing Xi’s underlying strategy of state-led development,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.

            The announcement of the economic growth target for 2024, set to be delivered by Premier Li on Tuesday, is among the most important issues to watch during the two sessions.
     
            Analysts widely expect Li to reveal a relatively ambitious growth target of “around 5%,” showing that policymakers are still focused on economic growth, even as challenges pile up.
     
            Observers will also be closely watching how markets respond. Heading into the gathering, many are skeptical that projections of confidence and measures announced at the event will be enough to restore optimism.
     
            But even if they don’t, that’s unlikely to dent Xi’s power.
     
            “The country’s economic problems are eroding ordinary people’s trust in the leadership’s ability to deliver higher growth and improved livelihoods,” said Asia Society’s Thomas.
     
            “However, Xi does not need to win elections so what matters most for him is elite control rather than popular approval. And the economy seems a long way from the type of collapse that could overwhelm the party’s sophisticated apparatus of repression.”

            China’s vast manufacturing industry sent mixed signals last month about the health of the economy, fueling calls for Beijing to do more to boost growth just days before a key meeting of the country’s leaders.
     
            The National Bureau of Statistics reported Friday that the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) of activity at mainly large, state-owned manufacturers dropped to 49.1 last month, down from 49.2 in January. It was the fifth consecutive month the index has shown a reading below 50, indicating contraction in the sector.
     
            But the Caixin manufacturing PMI — which focuses on smaller, private companies — rose to 50.9 in February, up from 50.8 in January, according to S&P Global, which compiled the survey. It was the fourth straight monthly expansion for the index.
     
            Friday’s data came just a day after China’s top leadership pledged to meet economic growth targets for 2024 by spurring domestic demand and boosting tech and innovative industries.
     
            Next week, thousands of delegates from across China will gather in the capital for the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) at which the growth target for the year is expected to be revealed.
     
            “The fact that the significant divergence between the two manufacturing PMIs has lasted for four months in a row may be a sign of structural shifts in the economy,” Goldman Sachs analysts said on Friday.
     
            The divergence in the output and new order sub-indexes is likely related to differences in geographic and sector coverage, as the Caixin PMI covers more southern regions, they said. Southern China is home to key export hubs in Guangdong and Zheijang.
     
            “Overall, the manufacturing sector continued to improve in February,” said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement that accompanied the Caixin PMI data.
     
            However, the economy still faces headwinds, he added. This was reflected by total new orders growing more slowly than output, prices remaining subdued, and employment continuing to contract.
     
            “Looking ahead, the focus should be on the effectiveness of the measures [announced previously by Beijing to boost growth],” Wang said. “Further efforts may be required to improve people’s livelihoods and market expectations.”
     
            China reported sluggish economic growth of 5.2% last year. This year, growth is expected to slow further to 4.5%, according to the World Bank’s most recent forecast in December.
     
            The Communist Party’s Politburo, its top decision-making body, held a meeting on Thursday to discuss the government work report that is due to be presented at the NPC meeting next week.
     
            The 24 members of the decision-making body, led by Chinese President Xi Jinping, vowed to “meet the annual economic and social development goals and tasks,” according to a readout of the meeting published by state-owned Xinhua.
     
            The officials reiterated that they would step up an existing proactive fiscal policy, implement a prudent monetary policy, expand domestic demand and boost sectors related to technology and innovation.
     
            Analysts expect Beijing will unveil more details about the measures during next week’s NPC session.
     
            “Fiscal policy will lead the way,” HSBC analysts said Friday.
     
            “We expect the broad-based fiscal deficit to be set at [approximately] 8% of GDP and the official fiscal deficit at [approximately] 4% of GDP,” which means there could be more local government bond issuance to boost infrastructure spending, they added.

            The US Commerce Department is opening an investigation into the national security risks posed by foreign-made hardware and software in smart cars, particularly Chinese-made technology, the department announced Thursday.
     
            The new investigation — which could lead to regulations restricting the use of certain car parts in the US — reflects growing concern within the Biden administration that countries like China could exploit navigation data or connections to car-charging stations, for example, to collect intelligence or sabotage infrastructure.
     
            The inquiry will focus on “connected vehicles,” a broad term for virtually any modern car that uses network connections for roadside assistance, satellite communications or a range of other features.
     
            “Connected vehicles from China could collect sensitive data about our citizens and our infrastructure and send this data back to the People’s Republic of China (PRC),” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “These vehicles could be remotely accessed or disabled.”
     
            Russia, Iran and Venezuela are some of the other countries that US national officials are concerned about when it comes to connected vehicles, according to a senior administration official.
     
            No regulatory action is underway. Instead, the Commerce Department is soliciting public comments on whether it will need to restrict certain technology deemed a national security risk.
     
            “We need to protect ourselves,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters when announcing the investigation. “The PRC knows that connected vehicles are a security threat.”
     
            Researchers at Department of Energy-funded laboratories have studied potential vulnerabilities in electric vehicle charging stations for years, trying to anticipate how foreign hackers might infiltrate the equipment. But US officials’ security concerns about smart cars have only grown more acute in recent years.
     
            The White House held a meeting in October 2022 with senior officials from across the government and automobile industry executives to strategize on how to bolster cybersecurity in electric vehicles.
     
            The new investigation is the second major action taken by the Biden administration in a week to address national security concerns about Chinese technology embedded in US infrastructure. Administration officials said last week that they would invest more than $20 billion over five years in new port infrastructure, including cranes built in the US rather than China.
     
            The Commerce Department investigation of Chinese-made technology used in cars is part of a broader struggle between the US and China for a leg up in the automotive market. The Chinese government has its own concerns about the data gathered by Tesla vehicles, and some Chinese government ministries have barred the vehicles from entering their compounds, CNN has previously reported.

            Vogue China editorial director Margaret Zhang has announced that she is stepping down just three years after becoming the youngest person to lead any of the fashion bible’s 28 editions.
     
            In a hand-written note posted to various social media channels in both English and Chinese on Monday, the Australian-born editor said she had decided to “wrap up at Vogue and jump into the next chapter of my career.”
     
            “I am immensely proud of the radical evolution that we have driven at Vogue China over the past three years, expanding its impact from its print beginnings to becoming a multimedia bridge for creative culture — China to the world, the world to China,” added Zhang.

            Zhang’s appointment as Vogue China’s editorial director in 2021 came as something of a surprise. Then 27, she had never edited a major fashion publication, but instead rose to prominence as a blogger in Sydney — and as a model, photographer and consultant for brands like Moncler and Mulberry.
     
            Her online profile and social media presence (Zhang now has over 2 million followers on Instagram) brought her to Vogue’s attention, with the US edition’s longtime editor-in-chief — and publisher Condé Nast’s chief content officer — Anna Wintour writing at the time: “Her international experience, exceptional multiplatform digital expertise, and wide-ranging interests are the perfect combination to lead Vogue China into the future.”
     
            Zhang’s tenure at the magazine proved, at times, controversial, with the former head of Condé Nast’s Chinese arm reportedly criticizing her for being too Westernized and inexperienced to lead the magazine.
     
            But she also won praise for modernizing Vogue China and championing diversity at the title. In her resignation announcement, Zhang said the publication had enjoyed “record growth in video” and the “highest engagement events in the history of Vogue China” during her editorship.

            “Never before have we seen so much Chinese creativity showcased across the global network of Vogue editions,” she added. “The legacy of these achievements is a testament to the Vogue China team’s belief in excellence and innovation.”
     
            Zhang’s announcement was met with messages of support from several high-profile fashion industry figures, including designers like Anna Sui and Native American model Quannah Chasinghorse, who responded to her Instagram post with the comment: “So inspiring! Mahsi’choo (“Thank You” in the Gwich’in language) for all you’ve done, so much positive change and beautiful work looking forward to seeing what you do next.”
     
            Zhang’s departure comes just weeks after British Vogue’s editor, Edward Enninful, published his final issue. The Ghanaian-born fashion editor unexpectedly stepped down last June after more than six years at the helm.
     
            A broader editorial shake-up at Condé Nast saw CEO Roger Lynch announce last November that the company was looking to cut 5% of its workforce. The publisher has since been accused by its staff union of violating labor law, leading more than 400 workers at titles like Vanity Fair and Vogue to walk out in protest in January.

            Washington will allow Chinese airlines to further increase their direct passenger flights to the United States, as it takes another step in gradually restoring aviation services that had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and an air travel dispute between the two countries.
     
            From March 31, Chinese carriers will be able to fly 50 weekly round trips to and from the United States, up from 35 currently, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) said in a statement Monday.
     
            But even with the increase, it’s still only a fraction of the more than 150 weekly round trips allowed by each side before curbs were imposed in early 2020 due to the coronavirus.
     
            The DOT said it had made the decision after assessing market conditions and considering the public interest.
     
            This is “a significant step forward in further normalization of the US-China market in anticipation of the summer 2024 traffic season,” it said in the statement.
     
            The move marks the fifth time the US regulator has increased the quota granted to Chinese carriers following China’s post-covid reopening. The first was in May 2023.
     
            “The gradual recovery of the US-China flight route is a positive catalyst to the summer peak outbound traffic and cost improvement as it increases wide-body utilization,” Citi analysts said in a research note on Tuesday.
     
            The DOT said it was in talks with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) about a “gradual” reopening of bilateral air services.
     
            Those services plunged following the emergence of Covid-19 in 2020. By February of that year, most American airlines had suspended flights to China due to fears about the coronavirus.
     
            In the next month, the CAAC slashed international flights to China, citing the need to curb imported Covid-19 cases. Foreign carriers that were still flying to the country were limited to just one weekly flight. The ones that had previously stopped services weren’t allowed in at all.
     
            The move by the Chinese regulator, which effectively banned many airlines from flying to China, triggered a dispute between Beijing and Washington. It further strained relations that had already deteriorated because of questions over the origin of the pandemic and Beijing’s move to tighten its grip over Hong Kong.
     
            In response to Beijing’s restrictions, the Trump administration announced in June 2020 that it would block Chinese passenger airlines from flying into or out of the United States.
     
            Despite the two sides amending their rules after negotiations, the number of flights between the United States and China still fell significantly during the pandemic.
     
            After China removed most of its Covid restrictions in December 2022, the DOT announced in May 2023 that it would allow Chinese airlines to boost their US weekly round-trip flights from eight to 12, marking the first increase in three years. The number was equal to the number of flights Beijing had permitted for American carriers.
     
            Since then, the DOT raised the quota three more times before Monday’s increase.
     
            Last August, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visited Beijing and said she wanted to promote people-to-people exchange with a focus on travel and tourism.
     
            “Before Covid, as many as 3 million Chinese travelers visited the United States annually, contributing more than $30 billion to the US economy. We look forward to once again welcoming Chinese group travel to the United States,” she said in a statement issued at the time.
     
            But challenges to a full restoration of travel still exist.
     
            In February 2023, two US senators urged the Biden administration to stop Chinese airlines and other non-US carriers from flying over Russia on US routes, as it gives them an advantage in fuel burn and flying time, according to Reuters.
     
            In June, Reuters reported that newly approved flights by Chinese airlines were indeed avoiding Russian airspace on their way to the United States.
     
            Russia has banned US and other foreign airlines from flying over its airspace, in retaliation for Washington closing its sky to Russia in March 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine.

            For the last three decades, Peeyush Mittal has frequently driven the 185 miles from the Indian capital to the city of Jaipur. The journey always took him six hours.
     
            “For 30 years there’s been this promise of doing that journey in three hours. It has never been possible,” said Mittal, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, a San Francisco-based investment fund. “They’ve expanded the highway, gone from one lane to two lane to three lane, everything has been done. But that journey has always remained six hours.”
     
            Except last year, when he cruised at 75 miles per hour on a new expressway connecting the two cities, and made the trip in half the time.
     
            “My jaw dropped when I first time got on that highway. I was like, ‘Wow, man, how is this even possible … in India?” he said.
     
            The quality of India’s new infrastructure is just one of many reasons why Mittal, who manages funds focussed on emerging markets, and other investors are excited about the country’s growth prospects.
     
            Financial professionals around the world are noticing India’s development since 2014 under two-term Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has said he wants the South Asian nation to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025.
     
            The optimism around the world’s most populous nation is in stark contrast to the mood found in China, which is grappling with a myriad of economic challenges, including an accelerated flight of capital from the country.
     
            Its stock markets have suffered a protracted slump since recent peaks in 2021, with more than $5 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong bourses. Foreign direct investment (FDI) plunged last year, and fell again in January, down nearly 12% compared to the same month in 2023.
     
            India’s stock market, meanwhile, is hitting record highs. The value of companies listed on India’s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year.
     
            The future appears even brighter. India’s market value is expected to more than double to $10 trillion by 2030, according to a Thursday report by Jefferies, which would make it “impossible for large global investors to ignore.”
     
            “China is a no go, so … which is the other country that can maybe replace China?” said Mittal. “There’s no country like China other than India … in some form or fashion, it is the substitute that maybe the world is looking for to drive growth.”
     
            Japan has benefited from investors seeking an alternative to China — Tokyo’s benchmark index hit a new high for the first time in 34 years last week, helped by improving corporate profits and a weak yen. But the country is stuck in recession and recently lost its position as the world’s third biggest economy to Germany.
     
            The latest revision by global stock index compiler MSCI reflects the bullishness towards India. MSCI said this month that it would increase India’s weighting in its emerging markets index to 18.06% from 17.98%, while reducing China’s to 24.77%.
     
            MSCI’s indexes help institutional investors worldwide decide how to allocate money and where to focus their research.
     
            “India’s weight in the MSCI emerging market index was about 7% a couple of years back,” said Aditya Suresh, head of India equity research at Macquarie Capital. “Do I think that 18% [in the MSCI index] is naturally gravitating more towards 25%? Yeah, that’s kind of clearly where our conversations are leading us to believe.”
     
            As India heads towards national elections in the coming months, market watchers are hoping that Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wins a third term, bringing greater predictability to economic policies for the next five years.
     
            “If Modi is back with a majority and political stability is there, then I can certainly say with confidence that there’ll be a lot more investor interest in India on a more sustainable basis,” said Mittal.
     
            There are good reasons for the euphoria around India. From a surging young population to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.
     
            The International Monetary Fund expects India to grow by 6.5% next financial year compared to 4.6% for China.  Analysts at Jefferies expect the country to become the world’s third largest economy by 2027.
     
            Much like China more than three decades ago, India is only at the beginning of a infrastructure transformation, spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways.
     
            There is a “very strong multiplier effect” on the economy from the investments in digital and physical infrastructure, which “you cannot roll back,” Suresh said.
     
            The world’s fastest growing major economy is also trying to capitalize on the rethink underway among companies on supply chains. Global businesses want to diversify operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are exposed to risks arising from tension between Beijing and Washington.
     
            “India is a prime candidate to benefit from the ‘friend-shoring’ of supply chains, notably at the expense of China,” wrote Hubert de Barochez, a market economist at Capital Economics, in January.
     
            As a result, some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations in India. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said last June his company is looking to invest in India “as soon as humanly possible.”
     
            “[Modi] really cares about India because he’s pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do,” Musk told reporters.
 
            But some worry that India’s confidence may be bordering on hubris.
     
            While interest in the world’s fifth largest economy is rising, the lofty prices of India’s stocks are scaring some international investors away.
     
            Indian shares have always been expensive compared to other emerging economies, said Suresh, but now “the premium on the premium has expanded.”
     
            Domestic investors, both retail and institutional, seem to be brushing aside these high valuations, driving India’s stock market to unprecedented peaks.
     
            According to Macquarie, retail investors alone own 9% of India’s equity market value versus foreign investors at slightly under 20%. Analysts, however, expect foreign investments to pick up in the second half of 2024, once the election is out of the way.
     
            There’s another potential challenge. Despite its new economic swagger, India does not have the capacity to absorb all the money that is flowing out of China, whose economy is still about five times bigger.
     
            China “has a few too many companies which are $100 and $200 billion plus [in value],” Mittal said. “It is difficult to find home for that kind of chunk of money in India.”
     
            But the fact that India’s sizzling rally is driven by domestic investors adds to the country’s strengths and reduces its dependence on foreign fund flows.
     
            “It just massively insulates India from global dynamics,” Suresh said.
     
            Apart from geopolitical rifts and an uncertain economic outlook, foreign companies and investors have grown increasingly wary of domestic political risks in China, including the possibility of raids and detentions. Institutional investors are still very wary about buying Chinese stocks, even though many now look like a bargain.
     
            “There are many good businesses in China, but with all the regulatory issues it becomes very difficult to predict what they will look like in the long run,” said Priyanka Agnihotri, portfolio manager at Baltimore-based Brown Advisory.
     
            India, on the other hand, enjoys healthy relations with the West and other major economies, and is aggressively wooing large firms to set up factories in the country.
     
            In her budget speech in February, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said FDI inflows since Modi first came to power in 2014 stood at nearly $600 billion, which is twice the amount during the previous decade.
     
            “For encouraging sustained foreign investment, we are negotiating bilateral investment treaties with our foreign partners, in the spirit of first develop India,” she added.
     
            Analysts say that it would hard to stop the economic juggernaut India has set in motion, irrespective of what happens to China.
     
            “Even if China comes back to the table and resolves a lot of problems, I don’t think India is going back into the background anymore,” said Mittal. “It has arrived.”

            The self-made billionaire, who was once China’s richest man, died of an illness on Sunday at the age of 79, his company Hangzhou Wahaha Group said in a brief statement, without providing further details.
     
            In China, Zong was known as a legendary businessman who grew his soft drinks empire from a tricycle cart hawking ice pops to school kids into a conglomerate selling everything from milk drinks to bottled water and canned porridge.
     
            Zong was also hailed as a national hero for wrestling full control of Wahaha, which means “laughing child,” from its French partner Danone more than a decade ago. Victory in that bitter battle boosted Zong’s wealth to $8 billion, making him China’s richest man in 2010 and again in 2012, according to Forbes.
     
            His death was mourned across China. Condolences poured in from prominent Chinese entrepreneurs including Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack Ma and Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun. Wahaha employees and residents in the eastern city of Hangzhou laid flowers outside the company.
     
            Zong is survived by his wife and his daughter, Zong Fuli, who has long been groomed as his successor.
     
            The beverage tycoon’s rise came to embody the can-do spirit of China’s first generation of private entrepreneurs, who helped propel the country’s explosive economic growth in the years after it moved away from Chairman Mao Zedong’s class struggle to embrace market reforms in the late 1970s.
     
            Despite his wealth, Zong was known for his frugal lifestyle, which set him apart from many of China’s new rich. He was nicknamed “the richest man in cloth shoes” for always sporting plain black shoes, complete with a dark jacket and slacks.
     
            In an interview with the state-run People’s Daily in 2010, Zong said the title had brought little change to his life.
     
            “Every day, I still smoke two packs of cigarettes that cost 12 yuan (then $1.80) each, have two cups of tea, and eat my three meals at the company canteen,” he said.
     
            He was known for starting work around 7 am and not leaving the office until 11 pm, working for more than 12 hours a day long before the grueling “996” work schedule became commonplace. 996 refers to working 9 am to 9pm, six days a week.
     
            Born in 1945 in wartime China, Zong grew up desperately poor in Hangzhou and often went hungry. His father was unemployed, and his mother supported the family of five children on a monthly salary of 40 yuan as a factory worker, he said in an oral history book marking 40 years of China’s economic reforms.
     
            “Because of the hardship, as I child I had many dreams and hoped to make big money to repay my parents,” he said.
     
            As the eldest child, Zong left school after junior high to support his family and spent more than a decade doing odd jobs, including hard manual labor at a remote state-owned farm during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, when millions of young urban Chinese were sent to the countryside to “undergo re-education by poor peasants.”
     
            In 1978, the year Deng Xiaoping ushered in China’s economic reforms, Zong returned to Hangzhou and spent the next decade working as a salesman, sometimes traveling to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou for trade fairs.
     
            “My only dream at that time was to have my own company and do what I wanted to do, and I had been looking for such an opportunity,” he said in the oral history book.
     
            The opportunity finally came in 1987. Zong, 42, borrowed 140,000 yuan (then about $38,000) to set up his own retail company, selling ice pops and stationery to students at a nearby elementary school.
     
            The company, which employed only two retired teachers and sold ice pops for a penny each, would later become Wahaha, which is privately owned.
     
            During his door-to-door sales, Zong learned that many children were picky eaters and suffered from varying degrees of malnutrition, which was a big headache for parents. Spotting a potential opportunity, he partnered with a professor of nutrition to invent a vitamin drink for children, called Wahaha Oral Liquid.
     
            The product proved a huge hit, boasting nearly 100 million yuan (about $19 million at the time) in annual sales in the third year of its release. That year, Zong founded the Hangzhou Wahaha Group after acquiring a failing state-run canned food factory.
     
            By 1996, Wahaha had expanded its products to milk drinks, carbonated beverages and bottled water, and Zong came up with a long-term business plan that required investment worth hundreds of millions of yuan.
     
            Securing a loan of this size from state-owned banks was difficult at the time, and Zong turned to foreign capital, according to the 2010 profile of Zong in the People’s Daily.
     
            Wahaha partnered with Danone, which acquired a controlling 51% stake in the joint ventures.
     
            But the partnership soured in 2007, when Danone publicly accused Wahaha of making and selling Wahaha-branded drinks outside their joint ventures and cutting the French company out of the earnings.
     
            Zong accused Danone of orchestrating a “hostile takeover” and trying to buy out Wahaha’s stake at a low price.
     
            The feud escalated into a high-profile legal battle that made into the agenda of a meeting between then Chinese and French presidents in Beijing, according to Chinese media reports at the time.
     
            The dispute was eventually settled in 2009, with Danone selling its stake for about $500 million and ceding all control to Wahaha.
     
            Zong later described the legal battle as a “beautiful self-defense counterstrike to defend the dignity and interests of a national enterprise.”

            Luckin Coffee, the Chinese chain that has been rebuilding its business since a fraud scandal four years ago, has reported a commanding sales lead over rival Starbucks in the important China market.
     
            In 2023, Luckin generated total net revenue of 24.9 billion yuan ($3.5 billion), up 87% from a year earlier, according to its financial results released on Friday. 
 
            It didn’t break down its revenue by geography, but the vast majority of its sales come from China. Internationally, it has only 30 outlets in Singapore, the first of which debuted last March.
     
            Starbucks (SBUX), in comparison, reported total revenue of $3.05 billion in China for fiscal 2023 that ended October 1, according to a CNN calculation based on the company’s quarterly results. The US coffee chain has not reported a full-year figure for China sales.
     
            Xiamen-based Luckin said its unaudited net income for 2023 reached 2.85 billion yuan ($396 million), compared to 488 million yuan ($68 million) in 2022, it said.
     
            Luckin, which already calls itself China’s biggest coffee chain, says it had surpassed Starbucks in mainland China by number of outlets in 2019.
     
            The surge in Luckin’s sales last year was partly driven by its rapid expansion. By the end of 2023, Luckin had 16,218 stores in China, nearly double its 2022 count of more than 8,200.
     
            Starbucks, by contrast, had 6,975 stores in China as of the end of January, according to the company’s latest quarterly result published earlier this year. That number was up 14.5% from a year earlier.
     
            Some of Luckin’s stores are self-operated, while others are run by partners. Starbucks’ outlets in China are entirely company-owned.
     
            Globally, Starbucks is still by far the largest coffee chain, with 38,586 stores worldwide. The United States and China are its two largest markets.
     
            China, once a tea-drinking nation, has become a global coffee industry powerhouse, despite grappling with numerous economic problems in recent years. Data from the International Coffee Organization last year showed that coffee consumption in the country grew 15% in the year ended in September.
     
            Much of this demand is driven by the younger generation. As many as 36% of coffee consumers in the country were between 25 and 34 years old, and 30% were between 35 and 44 years old, according to a 2021 survey by Daxue Consulting, a Chinese market research firm.
     
            The number of branded coffee shops in China jumped 58% in the past twelve months, reaching 49,691 outlets, according to a December report by World Coffee Portal. That helped China overtake the US as the world’s largest branded coffee shop market.
     
            Luckin acknowledged the fierce competition.
     
            “We remain focused on our pricing and expansion strategy to sustain our growth and market share,” said Jinyi Guo, chairman and chief executive officer of Luckin Coffee, in a statement that accompanied the company’s results.
     
            Luckin was founded in 2017 and is backed by Chinese private equity firm Centurium Capital. It focuses on catering to young people, with mostly takeout booths and cashless payments. Its beverages are about 30% cheaper than those offered by Starbucks.
     
            Its bare bones stores usually offer only the most basic services, which has allowed the company to expand rapidly at a lower cost. It also requires consumers to use mobile phones to place orders, enabling them to collect extensive costumer data.
     
            By 2019, the company had outnumbered Starbucks stores in China, with more than 4,500 outlets, according to the company. 
 
            In 2019, Luckin went public in New York, where it was welcomed by investors who believed it could be a serious challenger to Starbucks.
     
            But the company was forced to retreat a year later following the admission that its earnings had been fabricated. Luckin was ultimately delisted from the Nasdaq, and its then chairman and CEO were both fired. It was also slapped with a $180 million fine by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
     
            After that, the company pledged to rebuild its businesses. Centurium Capital, an early investor in the coffee chain, became its controlling shareholder.
     
            Despite being surpassed in both store count and now sales, Starbucks still maintains a wide lead over Luckin when it comes to profitability. The Chinese company’s profitability has suffered as a result of its rapid expansion.
     
            In response to the competition, Starbucks announced partnerships with Alibaba (BABA) and Meituan in 2018 and 2022, respectively, expanding its online reach to Chinese consumers.
     
            While Luckin created buzz last year with a collaboration with Chinese liquor brand Kweichow Moutai, Starbucks is also attracting eyeballs with its innovative new drinks.
     
            The American giant launched a pork-flavored coffee earlier this month, in an attempt to cater to local tastes and traditions. Priced at $9.45, the drink combines Dongpo Braised Pork Flavor Sauce with espresso and steamed milk, with extra pork sauce and pork breast meat for garnish.
     
  Hassan Tayir contributed reporting.
 
  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Luckin’s net income in 2023 and 2022.

            China’s space agency has revealed the names of the spacecraft that it hopes will take Chinese astronauts to the moon by the end of the decade.
     
            In a news release over the weekend, the China Manned Space Agency said development was “progressing well” on the spaceship Mengzhou, or Dream Vessel, the lander, Lanyue, or Embracing the Moon, and a super-heavy-lift carrier rocket named Long March 10.
     
            The craft are part of an ambitious program Beijing hopes will confirm its status as a major space power.
     
            China has not released a date for its expected manned lunar mission but has said it would take place by 2030 as it aims to become only the second country to land astronauts on the moon.
     
            The Mengzhou spacecraft is made up of both a reentry module that will house astronauts and serve as the control center, and a service module for power and propulsion systems. The vehicle will be nearly 9 meters long and weigh 22 metric tons, according to state media.
     
            The Lanyue lunar lander will accommodate two astronauts and a 200-kilogram rover, reports said.

            The names of the craft were picked by a group of experts from nearly 2,000 proposals solicited from the public, according to the space agency.
     
            “Lanyue” first appeared in a poem written by the People’s Republic of China founder Mao Zedong in 1965, and “symbolizes the Chinese people’s aspiration and confidence in their exploration of the universe and expedition to the moon,” the agency said.
     
            The name Mengzhou is linked to the “Chinese nation’s dream of landing on the moon,” it added.
     
            Beijing’s space program has long been associated with leader Xi Jinping’s “Chinese dream” to “rejuvenate” the country and attain a place of power and prestige globally, including in its technological capabilities.
     
            China’s lunar ambitions come as more countries are elevating their space programs eyeing the potential scientific benefit, national prestige and access to resources and further deep space exploration that successful moon missions and other developments could bring.
     
            The United States is ramping up its lunar program, with NASA last month announcing its plan to land astronauts on the moon in 2026, a year behind its original schedule. That would mark a first for the US since its Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
     
            Last week, the commercial Odysseus lunar lander developed by Intuitive Machines became the first US-made spacecraft to touch down on the moon in 50 years.
     
            In January, Japan’s “Moon Sniper” robotic explorer landed on the lunar surface. The touchdown made Japan the third country this century — and the fifth ever — to land on the moon. India joined that list last year.
     
            Beijing has surged ahead with lunar landings in recent years with its unmanned Chang’e missions, which made history in 2019 when China became the first country to successfully land on the far side of the moon.
     
            The next unmanned mission, Chang’e-6, is expected to launch later this year and bring back the first samples ever collected from the moon’s far side.
     
            China also expects its upcoming missions to collect data toward another lunar goal – constructing a permanent international research station on the lunar south pole by 2040.

            Hot Stocks 


 
            With Hong Kong’s sky-high cost of living, residents like Andy Tsui have been looking for alternative ways to have more fun and spend less. And he’s found one.
     
            Recent weekends have seen him shopping at glitzy malls, singing at swanky karaoke joints and dining on the freshest Australian crayfish.
     
            Add a cup of the trendiest bubble tea, and his bill for the day normally amounts to no more than $60. That’s the sort of money many of his friends have been paying for just one meal — and no boba.
     
            His secret? Rather than spending his cash in his hometown of Hong Kong, he’s been crossing the border into mainland China to splurge instead.
     
            “You can have half a Peking duck for as little as 60 to 70 yuan ($10), more than enough to feed three people, and on every corner there is a bubble tea place that sells a cup that costs just 10 to 12 yuan ($1.70),” Tsui told CNN, ahead of yet another weekend trip to Shenzhen. “The price difference is just so stark.”
     
            During the visits, he often finds himself surrounded by “more Hongkongers than locals.”
     
            Tsui is one of the hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have been routinely making the short trip to the southern Chinese metropolis of Shenzhen on weekends for food, shopping and entertainment.
     
            Most are taking advantage of the high-speed rail service between the cities that opened in 2018, which has cut the travel time to less than half an hour.
     
            In the minds of the day trippers, these cross-border jaunts are just fun days out. But collectively, they are part of a bigger picture that reveals much about the shifting power dynamics between China and Hong Kong, and East and West.
     
            Such trips are noteworthy because, for much of Hong Kong’s modern history, the traffic has been largely — conspicuously, even — in the other direction. Hong Kong used to be the place where Chinese would escape to, not from.
     
            In the decades after the 1949 establishment of the People’s Republic of China, when the mainland was mired in poverty, hundreds of thousands of Chinese are estimated to have risked their lives to reach the glittering shores of what was then a British colony.
     
            They were drawn not only by the promise of Western-style freedoms, but by the sort of luxuries that only Western-style capitalism was able to afford at the time.
     
            Hong Kong’s draw endured long after Britain handed over control of the city to China’s communist masters in 1997. Under the “One Country, Two Systems” formula of governance, Beijing allowed the city to keep its capitalist ways and Western-style freedoms, mindful of upsetting an economy that was then equivalent to almost 20% of China’s.
     
            Even as recently as 2018, 51 million mainland Chinese tourists — about seven times the population of Hong Kong — visited the city, flocking to the local Disneyland or filling up suitcases stuffed with foreign goods such as baby formula to cart back across the border.
     
            Indeed, so numerous were the arrivals that, despite the boost to the economy, locals began to resent their guests. Newspapers ran reports about misbehaving mainlanders and street protests denounced them as “locusts.”
     
            The backlash got so bad that the Hong Kong government was eventually forced to limit Shenzhen residents to once-a-week visits.
     
            But fast forward a few years, and the picture has changed. In 2023, just 26 million mainlanders — about half of the 2018 crowd — visited Hong Kong.
     
            More tellingly, only about 200,000 mainland Chinese now visit the city on weekends, while more than twice that number travel in the opposite direction to Shenzhen, according to the data from Hong Kong Immigration Department tracking the second half of 2023.
     
            “When ordinary people of Hong Kong, which used to be the shopper’s paradise, prefer to shop in Shenzhen, Hong Kong is not doing well by its ordinary folks,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University in London.
     
            It’s possible too to see the reversal in weekend visitor figures as a victory for Beijing’s efforts to tighten its control over the once freewheeling city, following the outbreak of historic pro-democracy protests in 2019.
     
            Those efforts have included crude attempts to drum up patriotism and a sense of belonging to the mainland among Hongkongers, and more subtle ones based on economic incentives.
     
            The strategy can be seen in Beijing’s plans to integrate Hong Kong and its southern Chinese neighbors into a giant Greater Bay Area, which Beijing envisages as an economic hub to one day rival San Francisco, New York or Tokyo.
     
            Many Hongkongers resent that scheme, along with the various multibillion-dollar, record-breaking bridges that are being constructed to link the cities. They fear the intention is to subsume their city’s local identity.
     
            Beijing’s ambitions can also be seen in the creation of the once highly controversial high-speed rail system that now carries Hongkongers to their Shenzhen shopping sprees at lightning speed.
     
Controversy over the line had centered around a jointly manned checkpoint at the West Kowloon terminus in Hong Kong, where mainland law enforcement officers were allowed to take charge of immigration and customs procedures in an arrangement some Hongkongers considered an infringement of territory.
     
            The year 2018 was significant, and not only for the launch of the gleaming high-speed rail that now shuttles shoppers between Hong Kong and Shenzhen at 120 miles an hour.
     
            That year Hong Kong’s economy was finally surpassed by that of neighboring Shenzhen, a situation that would have been hard to imagine a few decades previously.
     
            Hong Kong’s economy is now equivalent to only about 2% of mainland China’s. As that number has fallen, critics say, so too have any lingering concerns Beijing might have had about upsetting Hong Kong by changing the “One Country, Two Systems” formula.
     
            In 2019, pro-democracy protests swept Hong Kong, fueled by perceptions that Beijing was tightening its reins and reneging on its promise of a high degree of autonomy for the city.
     
            A year later, Beijing responded by introducing a national security law that critics say has snuffed out many of the city’s freedoms, such as of speech and assembly, and introduced questions over the independence of its judiciary.
     
            That law, critics say, has further blunted the advantage that Hong Kong once held over its mainland neighbors; that it was an entrepot to mainland China with the bonus of British-style rule-of-law. Beijing, though, maintains that the law will bring stability and prosperity.
     
            Even as late as the 2000s, Hong Kong’s modern malls, trendy nightlife and East-meets-West culture were leaving Shenzhen’s offerings firmly in their shadow. But just as Hong Kong’s star was beginning to wane, Shenzhen’s was shining ever brighter.
     
            The seed for its stunning growth was planted in 1980, when China made the city one of its first special economic zones, positioning it to benefit from the country’s stellar growth as its communist leaders embraced what some scholars describe as a form of state capitalism.
     
            In the 1980s, the population of Shenzhen, a former fishing village, was only in the hundreds of thousands. Today, it has 13 million people and is now home to some of China’s biggest tech firms, including Huawei and Tencent.
     
            The megacity now has gleaming malls and luxury karaoke lounges with floor-to-ceiling projector screens that make those in Hong Kong look quaint by comparison. And it has plenty of room for expansion. In 2025, the city is expected to complete the world’s biggest indoor ski resort.
     
            Hongkonger Eddy Lam, 32, loves to go there for its wide selection of regional Chinese cuisines, from Chongqing’s spicy hot pot to xiaolongbao from Shanghai.
     
            “The decor is nicer, the place is bigger, and the food is more authentic,” says Lam, who has visited Shenzhen 10 times in the past three months.
     
            For others, Shenzhen’s main draw is - ironically - its Western-style membership only warehouse chains. It has branches of both Costco and Sam’s Club, a chain run by the American retail giant Walmart.
     
            Cherrie Leung, a wealth manager from Hong Kong, says she buys her milk and yogurt from one of the three Sam’s Club branches in Shenzhen.
     
            “They come straight from farms in Inner Mongolia, Beijing (and other places in China),” she says.  “And they’re super fresh.”
     
            The Hongkongers spending their weekends in Shenzhen say they’re there due to pragmatism, rather than patriotism.
     
            Hugo Sin, a 24-year-old bartender, has been visiting Shenzhen twice a month with his friends and girlfriend, occasionally splashing out on a fancy hotel that costs a fraction of the price in Hong Kong.
     
            “I just don’t have the time to always go to Taiwan and Japan,” he said. “If I had other choices, I probably wouldn’t go.”
     
            Spending power is a big part of the equation. Inflation and the cost of living have soared in Hong Kong recently. In December, the cost of buying alcohol and dining out were 19.2% and 3.6%, respectively, above what they were a year ago, according to government figures.
     
            Mainland China, by contrast, is grappling with deflation, which means many things there are getting cheaper. This is even more noticeable for Hongkongers because the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the US currency, has been rising in value compared to the renminbi, making prices in Shenzhen more affordable.
     
            Gary Ng, an economist with French investment bank Natixis, estimates that in 2023 alone, Hongkongers spent a total of $8.5 billion in Shenzhen and its neighboring southern Chinese cities.
     
            This does mean less money is being pumped into Hong Kong’s local restaurants and shops, making it harder for them to survive and more likely to close down. When that happens, the lure of Shenzhen burns even brighter and so the circle continues.
     
            Some version of this doom loop has played out in Hong Kong’s nightlife scene ever since the pandemic, when many music venues closed never to reopen. Across the border, the live music scene is thriving — even though acts must take care not to cross any political lines with their lyrics.
     
            For Beijing, the fading of Hong Kong’s nightlife may be no bad thing. Certainly, the recent influx of Hongkongers into Shenzhen hasn’t gone unnoticed, with China’s state-run news agency Xinhua recently hailing the figures as a “new sign of accelerated integration.”
     
            Even Hong Kong leader John Lee has put a positive shine on things, telling the city’s public broadcaster RTHK late last year that the trend was “a testament to the success of our work” to integrate Hong Kong with the rest of the country.
     
            Still, for many of those Hongkongers who grew up under British rule, or at least the lingering influence of it, that integration has its downsides too.
     
            Since Beijing’s imposition of the national security law, hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have left their home city, many of them permanently.
     
            And it is not to Shenzhen that most of them are heading.
     
            Instead, it is Western countries like Britain, Canada and Australia that are proving the biggest draw. Over the past three years, the former colonial master alone has welcomed well north of 100,000 Hongkongers on long-term visas.
     
            Whether that is enough to make Beijing rethink its integration masterplan seems unlikely.
     
            Tsang, from SOAS University of London, says the Greater Bay Area plan will put Shenzhen front and center, whether Hongkongers like it or not.
     
            “Few long-standing people of Hong Kong would like to see (the city) playing second fiddle to Shenzhen,” he says, “but they paid too little attention to Chinese politics to have noticed the change, until it is too late.”

Nvidia has named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the crucial production of processors that power artificial intelligence (AI) systems.
     
            The Santa Clara-based company said Wednesday in its annual report that Huawei was a competitor in four out of five major categories of its business, including supplying software and hardware for graphic processing units (GPUs), which are widely used in generative AI.
     
            Other companies also listed as its rivals in some areas include AMD (AMD), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO).
     
            The naming of Huawei came just two months after Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia (NVDA), told reporters in Singapore that the Chinese tech giant was a “formidable” competitor in producing AI chips, according to a Reuters report.
     
            The Shenzhen-based firm, which makes smartphones and telecoms equipment, surprised the world last year by launching the Mate 60 Pro, a cutting-edge phone powered by advanced chips.
     
            Questions swirled over how Huawei was able to manufacture the phone when it had spent the four years under US restrictions banning its access to 5G technology.
     
            The breakthrough represented a “milestone” achievement for China, according to analysts, as Beijing and Washington are locked in a battle over semiconductor technology.
     
            In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed sweeping curbs designed to curtail China’s access to advanced computing chips. In early 2023, Japan and the Netherlands joined the US in curbing the export of chipmaking technology to China.
     
            Beijing has hit back. In April, 2023, it launched a cybersecurity probe into Micron before banning the company from selling to Chinese companies working on key infrastructure projects. In July, it imposed export controls on two strategic raw materials, gallium and germanium, that are critical to the global chipmaking industry.
     
            In October 2023, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms.
     
            Nvidia has flagged concerns about getting caught up further in the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.
     
             Its competitive position has been harmed and could be further impacted in the long term, if there are further changes in US export controls on chips, it said in the annual report.
     
            “In the event of such change [in US export control rules], we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East,” it said.
     
            Nvidia reported strong earnings on Wednesday. Its profits for the three months ended January 28 were up 769% from a year ago. But its China business took a hit from US restrictions on chip sales to the country.
     
            “Growth was strong across all regions except for China, where our data center revenue declined significantly following the US government export control regulations imposed in October [2022],” Colette Kress, Nvidia’s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.
     
            Data centers, which includes the graphics cards, are Nvidia’s biggest source of revenue. Sales from its core data center business grew 409% year-over-year to a record $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter.
     
            She said China represented “a mid-single-digit percentage” of the company’s data center revenue in the fourth quarter, and is expected to stay in “a similar range” in the current quarter.
     
            Nvidia declined to comment on the news.

            US officials have been scouring a trove of newly leaked documents from a Chinese tech firm for clues on how the government in Beijing allegedly uses the company in extensive hacking campaigns, multiple US cybersecurity officials familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            The Biden administration’s study of the leak is ongoing, but private experts told CNN it offers some of the clearest public evidence yet of how they believe China’s powerful security agencies outsource hacking operations to tech firms to target victims around the world.
     
            The documents, posted anonymously online last weekend for anyone to access, include screenshots of chat logs, as well as records of employees and Chinese government clients of the tech firm I-Soon. The company’s hacking victims range from Tibetan exile-run political groups, hospitals in Taiwan and India to Hong Kong’s universities following the city’s mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, according to the leaked data. More than a dozen, mostly Asian, foreign governments are listed as targets.
     
            I-Soon’s clients include China’s police, intelligence service and military, according to a spreadsheet listing 183 contracts signed between 2016 and 2022 by I-Soon’s subsidiary in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
     
            “This is some of the best visibility we’ve had into Chinese hacking operations outside of a government SCIF,” said Adam Kozy, who used to track Chinese hackers for the FBI, using an acronym for classified facilities.
     
            “I’m not aware of the specifics you mentioned. In principle, I want to emphasize that China firmly opposes the unwarranted denigration and smearing against China,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said in an emailed statement when asked for comment.
     
            “The so-called claim that ‘the Chinese authorities surveil dissidents overseas’ is completely fabricated,” Liu’s statement continued. “China is a major victim of cyber attacks. We keep a firm stance against all forms of cyber attacks and resort to lawful methods in tackling them. China does not encourage, support or condone attacks launched by hackers.”
     
            Wu Haibo, the CEO of privately owned and Shanghai-based I-Soon, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
     
            The leak comes amid unprecedented tensions in US-China relations in cyberspace and appears to fly in the face of Beijing’s repeated denials that it sponsors cyberattacks.
     
            FBI Director Christopher Wray and other top US officials warned Congress last month that another set of Chinese hackers unrelated to I-Soon have infiltrated critical US infrastructure and could use that access to disrupt any US military response to a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
     
            Beijing has strongly denied the allegations and in turn accuses the US of conducting its own cyberattacks.
     
            “The Chinese government is really trying to change this narrative that China hacks other countries,” Dakota Cary, a consultant at security firm SentinelOne who focuses on China, told CNN. “So I think [the leaks will] really upset them.”
     
            GitHub, the popular software developer platform where the leaked data appeared, took the documents down late Thursday, saying the data was a “violation of GitHub’s terms of service.”
     
            I-Soon allegedly focused on cyber-espionage, including against governments across Asia, according to a CNN review of the data and interviews with private experts.
     
            Telecom companies also featured heavily in the list. Hundreds of gigabytes of call logs and user data were hacked from operators in countries including South Korea, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.
     
            In a leaked marketing presentation, I-Soon touted its participation in an unspecified hacking project for China’s Ministry of Public Security in 2018. The project “achieved significant results” and received “recognition and praise” from Chinese officials, according to a presentation slide.
     
            The leak also shows how its business of scooping up intelligence for Chinese security services is thriving years after some Wu associates were indicted by the US Justice Department and added to the FBI’s “Cyber Most Wanted List” for a worldwide hacking spree that targeted more than 100 companies around the world.
     
            In September 2020, according to the leaked chat logs, Wu shared a news article describing the additions to the FBI’s “Cyber Most Wanted List.” Four of those people were in the same WeChat group with Wu, according to the leaks. The executive responded suggesting they celebrate being “verified by the FBI.”
     
            Chinese court documents show that I-Soon later developed business relations with the FBI-wanted hacking group.
     
            In sharp contrast to the private boasting from I-Soon, the Chinese government has gone to great lengths to hide its alleged affiliation with hacking operations carried out on behalf of Beijing, according to private cybersecurity executives who have tracked the activity for years.
     
            After the Obama administration secured an agreement in 2015 from Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing would not “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property,” the Chinese government has increasingly tapped contractors like I-Soon to give an element of plausible deniability to its hacking operations, Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, told CNN.
     
            The reorganization of the Chinese military in recent years, and the need to cover the tracks of its hackers, Meyers said, has prompted the Chinese government to “lean more heavily on these companies for direct involvement in offensive operations.”

            China is sending two giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo – the first time it has granted new panda loans to the United States in two decades.
     
            A spokesperson for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance confirmed to CNN Wednesday that the zoo would be receiving the two pandas, saying there was no official timeline for their arrival, but they are “optimistic we will get pandas in the not-so-distant future.”
     
            The news comes just months after Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggested China could send new pandas to the US, specifically to the San Diego Zoo, as “envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.”
     
            “We are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation, and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,” Xi said in November.
     
            His comments came shortly after the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC sent its three pandas back to China – marking the end of more than 50 years of Chinese pandas being housed at the zoo. The National Zoo was the first US zoo to showcase pandas, and the end of its program had left Zoo Atlanta as the only other US zoo to feature pandas.
     
            San Diego Zoo returned its last two pandas to China in 2019, after its loan agreement ended.
     
            China loans pandas to more than 20 countries under a program often referred to as “panda diplomacy.”
     
            Over the past decade, Xi has approved new panda loans across Europe, including to Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. In 2022, China sent a pair of pandas to Qatar, in the first loan to a Middle Eastern country.
     
            China acknowledges the cuddly creatures are used for its “major political and diplomatic needs,” especially in places where it hopes to gain more influence or closer relations.
     
            “Ensuring the health and safety of giant pandas living abroad is the most important basis for international cooperation,” the head of the China Wildlife Conservation Association told state-run Xinhua news agency Thursday in an article on the upcoming loan to San Diego Zoo.
     
            Beijing’s panda diplomacy with Washington began in 1972, but the number of loans to the US have dwindled in recent years in tune with worsening US-China relations. Xi’s statement in November was seen as a gesture aimed at easing fraught ties between the two powers, coming hours after he held extensive talks with US President Joe Biden.
     
            And other US zoos are hopeful that pandas could return in greater numbers, with the Smithsonian National Zoo saying in November it had applied to receive more of the iconic animals.
     
            According to Xinhua, discussions are ongoing for “a new round of cooperation” with the National Zoo and a zoo in Austria.
     
            Fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable.

            Chinese companies are doing something rarely seen since the 1970s: setting up their own volunteer armies. At least 16 major Chinese firms, including a privately-owned dairy giant, have established fighting forces over the past year, according to a CNN analysis of state media reports.
     
            These units, known as the People’s Armed Forces Departments, are composed of civilians who retain their regular jobs. They act as a reserve and auxiliary force for China’s military, the world’s largest, and are available for missions ranging from responding to natural disasters and helping maintain “social order” to providing support during wartime.
     
            The forces, which do not currently operate outside China, have more in common with America’s National Guard than its militia movement, which refers to private paramilitary organizations that usually have a right-wing political focus.
     
            The establishment of corporate brigades highlights Beijing’s growing concerns about potential conflict abroad as well as social unrest at home as the economy stumbles, analysts say.
     
            The revival is also seen as a response to the pandemic, and part of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s efforts to tighten Communist Party control over society, including the corporate sector.
     
            “The return of corporate militias reflects Xi’s rising focus on the need to better integrate economic development with national security as the country faces a more difficult future of slower growth and rising geopolitical competition,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.
     
            “Corporate militias under military leadership could help the Communist Party more effectively quell incidents of social unrest such as consumer protests and employee strikes,” he said.
     
            China’s economy grew 5.2% in 2023, slightly better than the official target that Beijing had set. But the country is facing a myriad of challenges, including a record property downturn, surging youth unemployment, deflationary pressure, rising corporate defaults and mounting financial stress at local governments.
     
            Protests appear to be spreading as frustration grows. The number of labor strikes and demonstrations surged to 1,794 in 2023, more than doubling from 2022, when 830 cases were recorded, according to data from the China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based non-profit organization that monitors workers’ protests.
     
            Just over a year ago, protesters clashed with police at the world’s biggest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, as anger boiled over against Foxconn for reneging on promises to increase pay and benefits to attract workers back after the pandemic.
     
            Outside the corporate sector, militia units are often organized by local governments and universities, according to rules on militia work. These units still exist in most of these places today, only on a much smaller scale than in previous decades.
     
            Most of the companies that have so far announced militias have been state-owned enterprises (SOE), which are directly owned by central or regional governments.
     
            But in December, Yili Group, the world’s fifth largest dairy producer, became the first major privately-controlled Chinese company in recent history to set up a People’s Armed Forces Department unit.
     
            Yili is not majority controlled by the state, but the local government in Hohhot, the city where it is based, has an 8.5% stake, according its most recent exchange filings.
     
            It did not provide any details about the strength of the force or the demographics of the employees who have joined up. According to China’s Military Service Law, male militia members should be 18 to 35 years old. There is some flexibility for people with special skills. Women are also eligible to join, though age requirements have not been specified in the law.
     
            Yili’s unit will be under the direct management of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in Inner Mongolia, the area where the company is based, and the regional government’s Communist Party committee.
     
            The unit was formed to build a national defense force based at Yili, which can “serve in peacetime, cope with emergencies, and respond in wartime,” said Huang Zhiqiang, executive vice-chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, at a ceremony in the regional capital of Hohhot. A senior military official for the region and the city’s party secretary were also present.
     
            It was latest in a slew of militias established by major Chinese companies in the past year.
     
            In September, the Shanghai Municipal Investment Group, a government-owned property developer and construction firm, set up a People’s Armed Forces Department unit. It would be overseen by the Shanghai garrison of the PLA, according to Jiefang Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party in the city.
     
            Liu Jie, the garrison’s commander, said the militia would assist the army in duties such as providing jobs to demobilized veterans or recruiting soldiers for the military.
     
            At least 14 other state-owned firms have done the same last year, according to CNN’s analysis of state media reports.
     
            They include Mengniu Dairy, China’s second-largest dairy producer; Hai’an Urban Construction Investment and Development in Nantong city, Jiangsu province; three property construction, transportation and water services companies in Huizhou city, Guangdong province as well as nine firms in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.
     
            At a press conference in October, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry said the push to set up militias at state-owned companies was to “strengthen national defense development.”
     
            China’s militias predate the 1949 founding of the People’s Republic. In fact, they originated in the 1920s and supported the Communist Party in its numerous battles. After 1949, when the party took control of mainland China, the units were eventually embedded into governments, schools and companies.
     
            The forces were prevalent during the Maoist era from 1949 to 1976 and peaked in the late 1950s — with 220 million members — when military tension was high with the United States over Taiwan, according to government documents.
     
            Militias are a key part of China’s military, which is composed of two full-time professional forces: the PLA and the People’s Armed Police, which is tasked with internal security. Militias play a supporting role to the PLA, according to the country’s defense law.
     
            By enrolling a large number of civilians into the brigades, Mao Zedong, China’s revolutionary leader, said he was enhancing the country’s defense against the threat of “imperial forces” such as the United States. But historians said Mao used the forces to promote his personal agenda and consolidate his power.
     
            He embedded the brigades into the People’s Communes, huge collectives formalized in 1958 that managed almost all economic and political activities in rural China. The communes were a central part of Mao’s Great Leap Forward campaign, a disastrous effort to galvanize agriculture and raise steel production through collectivization that resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people.
     
            Mao also expanded the militia system to suppress and intimidate people who opposed his radical policies, while developing a cult of personality within and outside the party.
     
            After Mao’s death in 1976, the country started shifting its focus to economic growth rather than political struggle. As the economy took off, membership of militias collapsed to 8 million by 2011, according to most recently available data from the national defense ministry.
     
            Although some SOEs retained their militias, they hadn’t previously existed in major private enterprises until recently, as the private sector only started to re-establish itself after 1978, when China implemented free-market reforms.
     
            The resurgence of corporate militias is likely driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent crisis in the real estate sector, according to Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at Rand Corporation.
     
            “The Covid-19 pandemic could have played a role in motivating central leaders to seek more effective organizations and forces in society who could help manage and coordinate responses to major national emergencies such as pandemics,” he said.
     
            A years-long property market slump has triggered a widespread mortgage strike. Since 2022, angry homebuyers in many Chinese cities have refused to pay their mortgages for unfinished apartments after cash-strapped developers delayed or abandoned construction.
     
            The fallout from the real estate slump has spread to the financial sector, causing some major shadow banks to default on their investment products, which in turn has stirred demonstrations by people who lost money.
     
            The re-establishment of the People’s Armed Forces Departments is also related to Xi’s larger effort to overhaul the Chinese military, Heath added. The Chinese leader has made no secret of his goal to “modernize” the PLA and transform it into a “world class” fighting force.
     
            “The main purpose of the changes is to improve the military’s ability to carry out a defense mobilization of assets. This can, in the long run, save the PLA resources by delegating some duties to militia forces to care for,” Heath said.
     
            Willy Lam, senior fellow of the Jamestown Foundation, points to a sense of déjà vu.
     
            “We are seeing the revival of Mao’s key slogans — ‘the people’s warfare’ and ‘the organic co-existence of the civilian and military sectors,’” he said.
     
            That might reflect Beijing’s desire to further tighten control over society and put the country on a war footing, just like Mao did in 1950s and 1960s.
     
            In the longer term, Xi might be preparing for an invasion of Taiwan, when “much of China will become militarized,” Lam said, adding that big cities could be turned into “militarized zones” or “ports.”
     
            Xi has vowed that the island’s eventual “reunification” with the mainland is “a historical inevitability.” China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it.
     
            “If more and more citizens become members of their militia, their nationalistic fervor will supposedly be raised,” Lam said.

            HSBC posted a big drop in quarterly profit Wednesday after taking a $3 billion hit on its stake in China’s Bank of Communications (BoCom) and another charge related to exposure to the country’s troubled real estate industry.
     
            The Asia-focused lender reported an 80% drop in pretax profit in the last three months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, it said in a statement.
     
            HSBC attributed the decline to a pair of charges that it took. Of the total, $3 billion was related to BoCom, one of China’s biggest banks, while $2 billion was from selling its retail banking business in France.
     
            HSBC said the $3 billion impairment was calculated after a December evaluation, which included an estimate of future cash flows at BoCom.
     
            Separately, HSBC made $3.4 billion in provisions to cover expected credit losses and other charges related to its exposure to the commercial real estate sector in mainland China.
     
            “Backing out a lot of the mess, it looks like performance was a little worse than expected with higher operating costs more than offsetting slightly better impairments,” Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a research note.
     
            “Mainland China remains a question mark… while loan loss charges were better than expected, the Chinese commercial real estate sector continues to be weak,” he said.

            But the UK-headquartered bank, Europe’s biggest by market value, maintained a positive view on China.
     
            “China’s recovery after reopening was bumpier than expected, but its economy grew in line with its annual target of around 5% in 2023. We expect this to be maintained in 2024, with recently announced policy measures to support the property sector and local government debt gradually flowing through to the wider economy,” Chairman Mark Tucker said in the statement.
     
            China’s economy has been hobbled by a real estate crisis since 2021, when a government crackdown on borrowing by developers triggered a funding squeeze in the sector.
     
            The property market has since entered a prolonged slump, marked by an ongoing decline in real estate investment and sales of property. Dozens of major developers have defaulted on their debt, with Evergrande, once the country’s second largest homebuilder, ordered to liquidate last month.
     
            The charges reported by HSBC cast a shadow over its record annual profit, which came in at $30.3 billion, up 78% from 2022. A group of analysts polled by the bank itself had anticipated yearly pretax profit of $34.1 billion.
     
            HSBC’s Hong Kong-listed shares declined following the results announcement, closing nearly 4% lower. Its London-listed shares fell 7% when the market opened.
     
            HSBC said it has a 19% stake in BoCom, which it purchased in 2004.
     
            “BoCom remains a strong partner in China, and we remain focused on maximising the mutual value of our partnership. Our positive views on the medium and long-term structural growth opportunities in mainland China are unchanged,” it said.
     
            HSBC isn’t the only European lender to be affected by China’s property woes. In October, rival Standard Chartered reported a $186 million credit impairment charge related to commercial real estate in the country.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/21/china/china-coast-guard-taiwan-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,China’s coast guard has triggered ‘panic’ in Taiwan. That’s only part of Beijing’s plan,"Chinese coast guard’s increased patrols are Beijing’s latest effort to tilt the status quo in its favor by undermining Taiwan’s control of waters around its outlying islands, analysts say.","Feb 21, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Nectar Gan,China,"
            King Xia, a Taiwanese tourist boat, was taking 23 passengers on a journey around Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen Islands just miles from China’s southeastern coast when it was intercepted by two Chinese coast guard vessels.
     
            Six Chinese officers swooped onboard, checking the vessel’s route plan, certificate and the licenses of its 11 crew members in a “forced” inspection that lasted about half an hour, according to Taiwan’s coast guard, which said King Xia had “veered toward” the Chinese side of the water to avoid shoals.
     
            The unprecedented encounter with Chinese law enforcement at a time of heightened tension between Beijing and Taipei startled Taiwanese passengers onboard.
     
            “It’s super scary,” a passenger told Taiwan’s United Daily News in a video upon returning to shore under the escort of a Taiwanese coast guard ship on Monday. “(I was) so afraid that I wouldn’t be able to come back to Taiwan.”
     
            Kuan Bi-ling, head of Taiwan’s Ocean Affairs Council, said Tuesday the incident triggered “panic” among the Taiwanese public.
     
            For years, sightseeing boat tours between Kinmen and Xiamen, the closest city on the Chinese mainland, have offered Taiwanese tourists a chance to gaze at China’s dazzling skyline without the hassle of border checks, with China operating similar tour boats for its citizens too.
     
            But now, the popular route has been caught up in rising tensions as China’s coast guard ramps up patrols in the area – in what analysts say is Beijing’s latest effort to tilt the status quo in its favor by undermining Taiwan’s control of the waters.
     
            The escalation came after two Chinese fishermen drowned last week when their speedboat capsized during a pursuit by Taiwan’s coast guard, who accused them of trespassing into prohibited waters around Kinmen.
     
            Beijing has blamed Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the deaths and seized on the opportunity to expand its presence in the waters.
     
            Since the weekend, Beijing has denied Taiwan’s designation of “prohibited or restricted waters” near Kinmen, while its coast guard has launched “regular patrols” in waters around the islands to step up law enforcement.
     
            On Tuesday morning, a Chinese coast guard vessel intruded into Taiwan-controlled waters near Kinmen for an hour, according to Taiwan’s coast guard, which said it dispatched a ship of its own to sail alongside the Chinese vessel and used radio and loudspeakers to drive it away.

            Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, said the latest measures are part of China’s “gray zone” tactics, referring to coercive or aggressive state actions that stop short of open warfare – something Beijing has used increasingly in recent years in the East and South China Seas, as well as toward Taiwan.
     
            The inspection of a Taiwanese tour boat by China’s coast guard, which Chong said had not happened before, was meant to provoke Taiwan and see if it would either escalate or accept this sort of behavior as given.
     
            “(The Chinese coast guard) chose a tourist vessel because it’s high profile – you would expect lots of people on the boat with cameras and phones,” he said.
     
            “They’re trying to erode and contest Taiwan’s ability to administer those waters.”
     
            Taiwan’s coast guard has said it would continue to enforce the law in waters it controls and “flexibly adjust its operations to ensure the peace and security.”
     
            Kuan, head of Taiwan’s Ocean Affairs Council, said Taiwan authorities would “educate” Taiwanese boat captains that they don’t need to stop for Chinese coast guard inspections. In such instances, they should immediately notify the council for assistance, she said.
     
            The stakes are high, as the increased presence and closer proximity of Chinese and Taiwanese coast guard vessels raise the specter of miscalculations that could potentially spiral into open conflict.
     
            Speaking to reporters about the inspection by the Chinese coast guard, Taiwan’s Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-kcheng highlighted such risks, saying the defense ministry is “very concerned” about potential miscalculations.
     
            To avoid further escalating tensions, Taiwan’s military will not “proactively intervene” in the incident, he said.
     
            China has already increased pressure on Taiwan after Vice President Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwanese identity and sovereignty, won the presidential election in January, handing the DPP a historic third consecutive term.
     
            Days after the election, Beijing poached one of Taipei’s few remaining diplomatic allies, the Pacific Island nation of Nauru.
     
            Last month, Taiwan protested China’s “unilateral” adjustment of a flight path that could result in civilian aircraft flying closer to the sensitive Taiwan Strait median line, adding pressure on Taipei in its aviation safety and aerial defense.
     
            The median line has long served as an informal demarcation between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. China does not formally recognize the existence of such a line but had largely respected it until recent years.

            Since then-US House-speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei in 2022, Chinese military jets have regularly flown over the median line as Beijing ramps up military pressure on the self-ruled democracy.
     
            Tian Feilong, a hardline legal scholar in Beijing, likened the increased patrol by the Chinese coast guard in waters around Kinmen to China’s “breakthrough” of the median line following Pelosi’s visit.
     
            It’s not only “a declaration of sovereignty” by Beijing, but also “a gradual demonstration and establishment of a new normal” in China’s governance and law enforcement in the Taiwan Strait, Tian wrote in a commentary on guancha.cn, a nationalist Chinese news site.
     
            Chong, at the National University of Singapore, expects an increase in Beijing’s “gray zone” measures in the coming months, in the lead-up to Lai’s inauguration as Taiwan’s next president in May.
     
            “(It’s) an effort to test the incoming Lai administration to see if they will give any concessions – or whether they’ll make any mistakes that Beijing can capitalize on,” he said.
     
            “Such slow, incremental behavior makes it difficult to respond strongly to, but also, giving in would be in a way ceding ground to Beijing.”

            Beijing’s C919 airliner, a potential rival to Western-made Boeing and Airbus planes, made its first foray outside Chinese territory on Sunday by staging a flyby at the Singapore Airshow.
     
            The single-aisle jet, manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is a prominent symbol of Beijing’s broader “Made in China” strategy, which aims to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers.
     
            China calls the C919, which can carry just under 200 passengers, its first large homegrown passenger jet. The aircraft took to the skies for its first commercial flight last May. It s certified to carry passengers only within mainland China and flies with China Eastern Airlines.
     
            This is “the first time we will be having exhibitors from China,” Cindy Koh, executive vice-president of Singapore’s Economic Development Board, one of the airshow’s organizers, told reporters Sunday.
     
            At the show, which started officially on Tuesday, China’s state-owned Tibet Airlines announced an order for 40 C919 jets, plus 10 of the smaller ARJ21 regional jets that Comac also makes, according to Chinese state media Global Times.
     
            China has made no secret of its ambition to eventually compete against Boeing (BA) and Airbus (ABNB). The C919’s overseas debut comes at a time when Boeing is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Last month, part of the fuselage of a 737 Max 9 Boeing plane fell off during an Air Alaska flight in the United States.
     
            Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, a firm that tracks the aviation industry, said the C919 would be “the most scrutinized aircraft at the Singapore Airshow,” an event that draws company executives and high-ranking government officials from around the world.
     
            “There is a lot of interest to see the actual aircraft, how it performs and how it is in flight,” he said.
     
            Currently, only a handful of countries make their own planes because of extremely high barriers to entry in the industry. A high level of technical expertise, as well as huge amounts of time and resources, is needed.
     
            The C919, for instance, has cost its backer an estimated $49 billion in development, manufacturing and other costs, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, though it says pinning down precisely how much is a tough task because Comac’s finances are opaque.
     
            In December, it conducted a demonstration flight in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour, in its first voyage outside mainland China.
     
            Yusof said rising tensions between Beijing and Washington would also make it difficult for Comac to find a market in the West.
     
            “You can’t run away (from) all the politics with China and the rest of the world, and that sigma is going to stick with them for quite a while,” he said.
     
            The model has not yet been certified by American and European aviation regulators, which Yusof said was “a big disadvantage.”
     
            With capacity to fly between five to six hours, the C919 is perfect for regional travel, he added, saying it had the potential to appeal to countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Central Asia, which are politically more friendly to China.
     
            “It will become a competitor in a small way, but it won’t be in the same league as Airbus and Boeing,” he said.
     
            Last year, Indonesian low-cost airline TransNusa became Comac’s first overseas customer, snapping up its ARJ21, which can carry just under 100 passengers.

            China’s central bank has cut its key mortgage reference rate by a record amount, as it ramps up efforts to stem a prolonged property crisis.
     
            The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced Tuesday that it would cut its five-year loan prime rate (LPR) from 4.2% to 3.95%, while keeping the one-year LPR unchanged at 3.45%.
     
            The 25 basis point cut to the five-year LPR is the biggest reduction the central bank has made since it revamped its LPR system in 2019. That August, the central bank announced that the LPR would become the new reference rates for lending by Chinese banks.
     
            The latest cut was also the first reduction to the five-year LPR since June 2023.
     
            The LPR is the rate at which commercial banks lend to their best customers. The five-year rate usually serves as a reference for mortgages.
     
            “Today’s 25 (basis point) cut to the five-year LPR is clearly aimed at supporting the housing market,” analysts from Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday.
     
            “On its own, it will not revive new home sales. But coupled with efforts to provide increased credit support to developers, today’s cut should help to reduce pressure on the property sector somewhat,” they said.
     
            China’s economy has been hobbled by a real estate downturn since 2021, when a government crackdown on developers’ borrowing triggered a liquidity crisis in the sector.
     
            The property market has since entered a prolonged slump, marked by an ongoing decline in both investment in and sales of property. Dozens of major developers have defaulted on their debt, with Evergrande, once the country’s second largest homebuilder, ordered to liquidate last month.
     
            The crisis has triggered widespread protests by unpaid construction workers, buyers of unfinished homes and frustrated investors facing financial losses. It has also spilled over to the country’s massive shadow banking industry, with Zhongrong Trust declaring itself severely insolvent last year after failing to repay its debt.
     
            Beijing has scrambled to revive the property sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China’s gross domestic product.
     
            Measures unveiled include slashing interest rates, reducing the size of down payments, encouraging banks to extend maturing loans to developers and loosening restrictions on home purchases in Chinese cities.
     
            China’s economy faces a litany of other problems, including deflation, low confidence and accelerated capital flight.
     
            The country’s direct investment liabilities, a measure of foreign direct investment, reached $33 billion in 2023, according to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Sunday.
     
            The gauge, which measures direct investments by foreign-owned entities in China, was down 82% from 2022 and stands at its lowest level since 1993.
     
            While an uncertain economic outlook and rising geopolitical tensions are partly to blame for the exodus, foreign companies and investors have also grown wary of increasing political risks in China, including the possibility of raids and detentions.
     
            The country’s stock markets have suffered a prolonged slump since their recent peaks in 2021, with more than $6 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong markets.

            China’s top diplomat Wang Yi had a message for his European counterparts over the weekend: no matter how the world changes, China will be “consistent and stable” – a “force for stability.”
     
            The claim, which Wang delivered during remarks at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, comes as European leaders are warily watching the upcoming United States elections – concerned that the potential return of former President Donald Trump could upend their partnership with Washington.
     
            Those concerns flared in the past week after Trump said he would not defend NATO allies that failed to spend enough on defense – a stunning threat for many in Europe as Russia’s invasion grinds on in Ukraine.
     
            The timing of Trump’s comments couldn’t have been better for Wang, who is visiting Europe as Beijing struggles to repair deteriorating relations with the bloc — an effort made more urgent by its domestic economic struggles and ongoing frictions with the US.
     
            “No matter how the world changes, China, as a responsible major country, will keep its major principles and policies consistent and stable and serve as a staunch force for stability in a turbulent world,” Wang said during remarks in Munich, while calling for China and Europe to “stay clear of geopolitical and ideological distractions” and work together.
     
            But while Wang’s pitch may land on receptive ears in some European capitals where leaders hope to stabilize aspects of their relations with China, Beijing also has a major issue when it comes to making real progress to repair ties, analysts say: its steadfast relationship with Moscow.
     
            Those challenges were underscored over the weekend in Munich, where the security conference was overshadowed by shock and anger as reports emerged of the death at age 47 of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.
     
            Leaders decried his death as the work of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime – with outrage amplifying mounting concern about the fate of Ukraine, which lost key ground to Russia on Friday.
     
            “Wang’s message to his European hosts is that geopolitical differences should not be allowed to get in the way of close cooperation,” said Noah Barkin, a visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) think tank.
     
            “What is left unsaid is that China is not prepared to change the positions and policies that worry the Europeans most, namely its deepening relationship with Russia and its distortive trade practices.”
     
            Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have bolstered their countries’ relations as both face rising tensions with the West. China – which has not condemned Russia’s invasion and claims impartiality in the conflict – has also emerged as a key lifeline for the sanctions-hit Russian economy.
     
            In Europe, this has galvanized concerns about China’s own global ambitions and played a role in the European Union’s ongoing push to recalibrate its policy toward China.
     
            In a panel discussion in Munich on Saturday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg drew a parallel between Russian aggression and China, saying continued American support for Ukraine would “send a message” to Xi discouraging potential use of force in Taiwan, a self-ruled island China’s ruling Communist Party claims.
     
            EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell reiterated the bloc’s “expectation that China refrains from supporting Russia,” in a meeting with Wang Friday. Western governments have not accused Beijing of sending extensive aid to Russia’s military.

            The EU is considering placing trade restrictions on three mainland Chinese firms as part of a proposed round of measures meant to hamper the Russian war effort, Bloomberg reported last week.
     
            In response to a query about the report from CNN, China’s Foreign Ministry said it “firmly opposes illegal sanctions or ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ against China under the pretext of China-Russia cooperation” and that “normal exchanges” between Chinese and Russian enterprises “are not targeted at any third party.”
     
            Wang made an apparent attempt to address concerns about China’s ties to Russia over the weekend, framing the relationship for his audience in Munich as part of Beijing’s efforts to cooperate with “major countries” to address global challenges.
     
            “Russia is China’s largest neighboring country,” Wang said, repeating usual statements that their relationship is not an alliance and does not “target any third party.” As such, “a China-Russia relationship that grows steadily … meets the shared interests of the two countries” and “serves the strategic stability of the Asia-Pacific and the world,” he said.
     
            When asked by conference chairman Christoph Heusgen in a public discussion whether China should do more to rein in Russia, Wang also hit back at what he claimed were attempts “to blame China or to shift the responsibility of resolving the Ukraine crisis to China.” Beijing has worked “relentlessly” to promote peace talks, he said.

Putin saw an existential threat in Navalny, the opposition leader whose name he dared not mention
 
            The diplomat reiterated as much in a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Saturday, stressing that China does not “sell lethal weapons to conflict areas or parties of conflict” and that it would “not give up its efforts” to re-establish peace.
     
            But those efforts have fallen well short of European hopes that China would use its considerable economic leverage and regular high-level communication with Russia, including between Xi and Putin, to end the conflict in a way that respected Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
     
            Instead, a push from Beijing to frame itself as a potential peacemaker in the conflict, spearheaded by Wang at last year’s Munich Security Conference, hasn’t produced tangible results. A plan for a “political settlement” of the conflict put forward by Beijing at that time was widely criticized as likely to help Moscow consolidate its territorial gains, as it called for a ceasefire without the prior withdrawal of Russian troops.
     
            It’s also unclear whether Beijing will attend an upcoming Ukraine-backed Global Peace Summit in Switzerland. Kuleba raised the event in his meeting with Wang, according to a statement on the Ukrainian diplomat’s X account. Beijing’s readout did not mention the event.
     
            Observers say that against this backdrop, Wang’s apparent attempts to dial down European concerns about China’s position relative to the war may have little impact within the EU.
     
            “As long as war in Ukraine continues, EU policies toward China will move into closer alignment with the US. Most likely, Europeans will join the US to double down export restrictions over critical technologies in light of viewing the Union’s economic security as paramount,” according to Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at the Chatham House think tank in London.
     
            The bloc is considering a host of measures that would help it to “de-risk” European supply chains from China, secure critical technologies and protect its market from what it sees as certain artificially cheap Chinese goods. Beijing sees European policy as excessively influenced by the United States.
     
            Wang also attempted to push back against such measures in Munich, warning that “those who attempt to shut China out in the name of ‘de-risking’ will make a historic mistake.”
     
            The Chinese diplomat met a number of European counterparts on the sidelines of the security conference, before continuing on to Spain. He is also due to visit France this week.

            Wang may see more success in stabilizing relations with individual EU member states interested in boosting economic ties — and those looking with uncertainty at the impending US elections, according to observers.
     
            In his European meetings, Wang may “utilize the ‘Trump factor’ to point out that completely siding with the United States is not in the best interests of European countries,” according to Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor in the City University of Hong Kong’s department of public and international affairs.
     
            As president, Trump not only voiced skepticism of the system of US alliances in Europe, but leveraged tariffs on European steel and aluminum, sparking retaliatory measures on US goods from Europe.
     
            “Wang Yi may point out that … if Trump becomes president it will be a problem if (Europe) doesn’t have a good relationship with China … He wants to persuade the European countries to be more neutral,” Liu said.
     
            Beijing has made some progress in smoothing relations with European countries in the past year, including during a visit to China from French President Emmanuel Macron last spring – a development Wang will hope to build on.
     
            “In national capitals, there will be a greater focus on keeping the relationship with Beijing stable, in part to head off the risk of a two-front trade conflict with Beijing and Washington, should Trump return to the White House,” said Barkin of GMF, who is also a senior adviser at the New York-based Rhodium Group.
     
            “(China’s) worst nightmare is a united transatlantic front on trade, technology and security issues … China will use Trump’s words to reinforce the message in European capitals that Washington is not a reliable partner,” he said.

            China has reported a record upsurge in travel and consumption during a longer-than-usual Lunar New Year holiday season, touting the gains as signs that the world’s second largest economy is regaining its footing thanks to the government’s supportive policies.
     
            But according to CNN calculations based on official data, the average tourism-related spending per trip was below pre-pandemic levels, as consumer confidence remains weak amid deflationary pressure.
     
            A total of 474 million trips were made within mainland China during the Year of the Dragon travel season, up 34% compared to the same holiday in 2023 and 19% higher than in 2019, according to data published Sunday by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
     
            Total spending by domestic tourists reached 632.7 billion yuan ($87.9 billion) during the holiday, it said.
     
            However, the most recent holiday season took place over eight days from February 10 to February 18, which was one day more than previous periods.
     
            “Supported by various favorable factors such as government policies, [services] supply, and propaganda work, people in urban and rural areas have exhibited a rising willingness to travel, with many indicators such as the number of trips and travel spending hitting record high levels,” the ministry said in a statement.
     
            This Lunar New Year period is the longest in recent history. Previously, the holiday had lasted seven days. It was also the first holiday since 2019 that was completely unaffected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
     
            The ministry did not provide details of the numbers of trips or spending by day. However, CNN calculations based on official data suggest the consumption level fell short of pre-pandemic levels.
     
            On average, 59.25 million domestic trips per day were made during this holiday period, slightly lower than the 59.29 million trips per day taken in 2019.
     
            An average of 166.85 yuan ($23.2) per trip per day was spent this year, down 6% from 2019s 176.9 yuan ($24.6).
     
            Travel outside mainland China, including to Hong Kong and Macao, was also below pre-pandemic levels, if the official figures are averaged out.
     
            A daily average of 1.69 million trips were made into and out of mainland China during the holiday, according to data provided Sunday by the National Immigration Administration. The figure was down 6% from 2019’s average of 1.79 million daily trips.
     
            “Although we do see some strength in the data, we urge market participants to exercise caution,” Nomura analysts said in a Monday note.
     
            “We maintain our view that the ongoing economic dip is likely to worsen into the spring,” they added.
     
            China’s economy is grappling with a myriad of challenges, including low confidence and deflationary pressure. In January, consumer prices fell by their fastest pace in 15 years, marking a fourth straight month of decline.
     
            There were some bright spots, though.
     
            While the consumption of big-ticket items like property remained sluggish, purchases of inexpensive items boomed.
     
            Movie ticket sales reached a record 8 billion yuan ($1.11 billion) during the eight-day holiday season, according to data released on Sunday by China Film Administration.
     
            The number of people who went to the cinema, a total of 163 million, also hit a record high, it said.
     
            But box office spending on its own wasn’t enough to dispel analyst concerns for growth this year.
     
            A record downturn in real estate, which accounts for as much as 30% of gross domestic product and 70% of household wealth, has dealt a significant blow to business and consumer confidence.
     
            “The property sector remains the main drag on economic growth,” said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.
     
            “Falling construction is weighing on investment, hurting industries from steel, glass and cement to construction equipment makers, plumbers, and architects. At the same time, declining property prices are a drag on consumer spending as households sense a fall in their wealth,” he said.
     
            During the holiday season, average daily new home sales in 25 major cities declined 27% compared to a year ago, according to the latest data from China Index Holdings, a leading private property research company.
     
            The mixed economic data gave mainland Chinese markets a modest boost when they resumed trading on Monday after the holiday break, but the Hong Kong market, which has been trading since Wednesday, dropped.
     
            “The headwinds to growth remain severe and it will take more than a bump in holiday travel for market sentiment to recover,” said Neumann. “In particular, investors are still looking for more stimulus to revive growth and are hoping greater details around housing sector stabilization measures.”
     
            The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were up 1.6% and 0.9% respectively, on their first trading day in the Year of Dragon.
     
            Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, however, declined 1%, and was poised to reverse three straight days of gains.
     
            China’s stock markets have suffered a protracted slump since recent peaks in 2021, with more than $6 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong markets.

China is increasing patrols in waters near a group of frontline islands controlled by Taiwan, as tensions rise after two Chinese fishermen drowned during a pursuit by Taiwan’s coast guard who accused them of trespassing.
     
            China’s coast guard said Sunday its Fujian division will strengthen maritime law enforcement and carry out “regular patrols” in waters around the Chinese city of Xiamen and Taiwan’s Kinmen islands, which lie just miles apart.
     
            The move is aimed at “further maintaining the order of operations in the relevant waters and protecting the lives and property of fishermen,” Gan Yu, a spokesperson for China’s coast guard, said in a statement.
     
            The patrols are likely to put Chinese coast guard vessels in closer proximity to their Taiwanese counterparts, potentially raising the risk of miscalculation and conflict.
     
            The escalation came days after a Chinese speedboat capsized while attempting to flee from Taiwan’s coast guard, which said it had trespassed to fish in waters about 1 nautical mile off Kinmen’s coast.
     
            Four crew members fell into the water. Two survived after being rescued by Taiwan’s coast guard, while the other two were found unconscious and confirmed dead after being taken to the hospital in Kinmen.
     
            Beijing has issued strongly-worded condemnations and blamed Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the deaths, claiming it had used “various excuses to forcefully seize mainland fishing boats and treat mainland fishermen roughly and dangerously.”
     
            “Such a vicious incident seriously hurt the feelings of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait” during the Lunar New Year holiday – a time for family reunions celebrated in both mainland China and Taiwan, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said on Thursday.
     
            The Chinese Communist Party regards Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and Chinese vessels are frequently active in the waters near Kinmen due to its geographical proximity to mainland China.
     
            Taiwan authorities on Thursday expressed regret over the deaths, but maintained that its coast guard officers were acting on their mandates in accordance with the law.
     
            On Saturday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office ramped up the rhetoric, saying the deaths had caused “strong indignation” in mainland China while denying Taiwan’s designation of “restricted” waters near Kinmen.
     
            “Fishermen on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been operating in traditional fishing grounds in the Xiamen-Kinmen waters since ancient times, and there is no such thing as ‘prohibited or restricted waters,’” it said in a statement.
     
            The office also urged Taiwan authorities to release the two surviving fishermen from custody.

            In a rebuttal, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said Sunday it will continue to enforce the law in waters it controls and expel or detain trespassing vessels.
     
            It also denied Beijing’s accusations of “rough expulsions,” saying the unfortunate incident happened due to “constant intrusions” by ships that carry no name, have no certification or port registration, and the refusal to cooperate by crew members who made a dangerous move to flee.
     
            The case is being investigated by prosecutors in Taiwan, the council added.
     
            Kuan Bi-ling, Taiwan’s Minister of Ocean Affairs Council, said the two surviving fishermen under Taiwan’s custody were “being taken care of” and would “be repatriated soon as the case progresses.”
     
            Kuan added that Taiwan’s coast guard had previously rescued mainland Chinese fishermen and cargo ships despite rising military and political tensions across the Taiwan Strait in recent years.
     
            Over the past three years, 20 people from mainland China have been rescued by Taiwan’s coast guard, according to Kuan.
     
            China has increased economic, military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan and cut off most communications with Taipei since the DPP came to power in 2016.
     
            In the preceding years, during the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang government’s term, rescue teams from Taiwan and mainland China had held joint maritime drills to practice search and rescue operations in a sign of warming ties.

            US markets reeled on Tuesday after January’s Consumer Price Index showed inflation came in hotter than expected, leaving investors to believe that interest rate cuts are off the table for the near future.
     
            Markets aside, the data was confirmation that prices are indeed still high and are taking a toll on Americans — just ask anyone who recently got a new car insurance policy (rates are up 21% from a year ago).
     
            China, however, is having a different problem: Prices are falling at their fastest rate in 15 years.
     
            No, that wasn’t a typo, falling prices are a problem when they’re widespread across an economy, like in China, which is experiencing what’s known as deflation.
     
            At first glance, falling prices may sound good. After all, who likes paying more for anything?
     
            But the problem with deflation is that when people begin to expect lower prices in the future, they have little incentive to make purchases right now. For instance, unless it was absolutely necessary, why would you buy a new oven today if you thought the price would go down significantly in a month?

            When enough people think that way, it causes massive pullbacks in spending. That can prompt a recession if it means businesses can’t afford to employ as many workers.
     
            In China, the effects of deflation have taken a major toll on stocks, making it the worst-performing equity market in the world last year. That prompted the nation’s sovereign wealth fund to purchase shares of Chinese-listed companies to boost prices.
     
            Additionally, China is pursuing stimulative measures aimed at boosting consumer spending.
     
            The surging inflation that Americans and people across many parts of the world have experienced over the past few years, primarily due to energy- and pandemic-related factors, is not what central banks want.
     
            Like the US Federal Reserve, most major central banks, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, target a 2% annual rate of inflation, not zero inflation whatsoever. That’s done to discourage people from delaying purchases.
     
            It also gives central banks a bit of a cushion against deflation.
     
            “Having a margin against deflation is important because there are limits to how far interest rates can be cut,” the European Central Bank states in a post on its site. “In a deflationary environment monetary policy may not be able to sufficiently stimulate the economy by using its interest rate instrument. This makes it more difficult for monetary policy to fight deflation than to fight inflation.”

            Global stock index compiler MSCI is deleting dozens of companies from its benchmark China Index, which could further exacerbate fund outflows from Chinese equities after a massive stock market rout.
 
            The index provider announced this week that it would drop 66 securities from the MSCI China Index, one of its flagship China indexes, as part of the company’s latest quarterly review. Five new securities will be added to the index.
     
            MSCI’s equity indexes are tracked by institutional investors worldwide for asset allocation and investment analysis. More than 1,370 global exchange-traded funds are linked to its various indexes, according to the company.
     
            The MSCI China Index is the compiler’s key index tracking the Chinese stock market, covering about 85% of the total market capitalization of Chinese companies listed globally.
     
            The decision by MSCI is likely to affect the weighting of Chinese stocks in global portfolios and could cause further fund outflows, at a time when investor confidence was already low.
     
            The changes, effective after the stock market closes on February 29, will reduce the total number of the index’s constituents to 704.
     
            This is an unusual move by the compiler, which for years had been largely increasing the number of stocks in the MSCI China Index. In its previous four quarterly reviews of that benchmark, it deleted a total of 57 stocks, and added 113.
     
            On Monday, MSCI also announced changes to its other China-related indexes, including deleting dozens of stocks from MSCI China A Onshore indexes and MSCI China All Shares indexes.
     
            China’s stock market has been in a protracted slump since recent peaks in 2021, with more than $6 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong markets.
     
            Investors are concerned about a myriad of challenges facing the world’s second largest economy, including but not limited to a prolonged property downturn, high youth unemployment, deflation and a rapidly falling birthrate.
     
            According to MSCI, among the 66 stocks to be removed include Greentown China Holdings, a Hangzhou-based property developer, and Gemdale Corp, a Shenzhen-based developer.
     
            Other deletions include social media platform Weibo, food and beverage producer Uni-President China, state-owned airliner China Southern Airlines, online lending platform Lufax Holdings and gene giant BGI Genomics.
     
            The five additions include electrical appliance manufacturer Midea Group and gene sequencing equipment maker MGI Tech.
     
            Beijing has been scrambling to draw a line under the three-year market rout, rolling out a raft of supportive measures in the past few months.
     
            Recently, it has pumped money into stocks via the country’s sovereign wealth fund and even replaced the head of its securities regulator in an apparent attempt to appease public anger.
     
            The redoubled attempts appeared to have bought Beijing some more time, as mainland Chinese markets had a short rebound last week before they closed on Friday for the Lunar New Year holiday.
     
            But they don’t address the underlying challenges the economy faces.
     
            “While Chinese stocks’ relative valuations are at an all-time low, prospects for the asset class are not particularly bright as investors doubt the willingness of Beijing to deliver large-scale scale support to revive the stock market,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist for Geneva-based Pictet Asset Management, in a research report last week.
     
            “What is more, [a] ﻿turnaround in the property market, which is key for an improvement in sentiment, is not in sight, ” he said.
     
            Hong Kong’s stock market reopened on Wednesday after a long holiday weekend, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.9%. Mainland China’s markets remain shut and will resume trading on February 19.

            Tourists taking the metro in Suzhou, China, this week could be forgiven for feeling like they’ve traveled back in time a few centuries.
     
            Famous for silk production and traditional gardens, this city of just over 10 million people, a 1.5-hour drive from Shanghai, is offering a week of free metro rides during the Lunar New Year period to passengers who dress in Hanfu – a style of clothing traditionally worn by ethnic-majority Han Chinese prior to the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).
     
            The Suzhou Rail Transit’s offer isn’t random. Dressing up in traditional outfits to visit local attractions has become a popular way to express one’s holiday spirit in China in recent years, especially among youth, many of whom have been sharing images of their outings on social media this week.

            So what exactly qualifies as Hanfu? There are many different styles of clothing inspired by multiple Chinese dynasties that could fall under this umbrella term, but most generally include a long, flowing cross-collar robe.
     
            In 2019, CNN Style reported on the comeback of traditional Chinese fashion, noting that the Hanfu industry’s total market value at that time was estimated to be worth 1.09 billion yuan, according to state media.
     
            Popularity reportedly tumbled during the pandemic, but a local media report says that interest in Hanfu has increased significantly in recent months. In January, in the run-up to the 2024 Spring Festival/Lunar New Year period, searches for modern Hanfu and silky Song brocade clothing on popular shopping website Taobao reportedly surged 683% and 2,058% respectively. 
 
            Multiple tourist sites in China now offer Hanfu rentals as well, some with makeup and hair styling services, similar to tourist attractions and historical sites in Seoul that rent out the traditional South Korean hanbok for visitors.
     
            For both domestic and international tourists, wearing these outfits while visiting historical or themed attractions can provide an added element of fun.
     
            During the 15-day Spring Festival/Lunar New Year holiday, the busiest travel period of the year in China, many of these sites host colorful lantern displays, providing eye-catching backdrops for photos.
     
            For instance, Yu Garden in Shanghai, which hosts a 40-day Spring Festival lantern fair, has become a popular destination for Hanfu fans. The nearby commercial shopping district of Wujiaochang even hosted a Lunar New Year Hanfu parade to attract revelers to the area this year.

            In the capital city of China’s southern Hainan province, Haikou, lies Qilou Old Street, which features a fusion of Asian and European architecture from the 1920s. It too has seen an increase in young tourists wearing traditional attire during visits, according to one local.
     
            “There are a lot more people – from visitors to tour guides to influencers – wearing Hanfu here at Haikou’s Qilou in these few years,” says Cai Pa, an area historian.
     
            “[The rise of Hanfu] is an important symbol of the Chinese cultural renaissance. The younger generations are often the ones that are more open to new trends – and hence, the ones who are the first to embrace the rejuvenation of tradition.”
     
            Cai tells CNN Travel it’s also getting more common to see people in other ethnic attires too, given the island province is home to several ethnic minority groups, the largest of which is the Li community.
     
            Song Weixia, a 30-year-old brand designer from the mountainous province of Anhui who incorporates fashion elements inspired by Hanfu into her everyday outfits, says there’s more to this fashion flashback than just holiday spirit.
     
            “Of course there are people who join the trend only during the Lunar New Year – but for most people, it isn’t just because of the festival,” she tells CNN Travel.
     
            “It is the rise in desire to understand and appreciate Chinese culture among young people in recent years. In fact, it’s an expression of a nation feeling confident with its culture.”
     
            Cai, meanwhile, feels that those in China’s cultural and tourism industries have a responsibility to keep authenticity in check.
     
            “There is a group of people who wear it as a trend or as a fashion item,” she says. “But it’s as important to have people who preserve the tradition the accurate way so the foundation of the tradition doesn’t get lost.”
     
            The question of authenticity within Hanfu has been debated for years, with some scholars and enthusiasts pointing out that Han Chinese people wore different clothing through the dynasties, with dozens of styles depending on the time period, geographic region and socioeconomic class.
     
            Others say the term “Hanfu” is too narrow, given the fluid sharing of influences among diverse ethnic groups in China.
     
            In the end, Song says she doesn’t focus too much on what clothes she wears to celebrate but rather how she spends time with her loved ones, as “that’s the core tradition of Lunar New Year.”
     
            “As a child, I’d look forward to the lively atmosphere,” she says.
     
            “But the bonding with family traditions seem to fade as one grows older. Lunar New Year serves as a strong emotional cord that brings you back to the most authentic self as you were a child. It’s warm and fuzzy.
     
            “As I grow up, apart from hoping to enjoy the festivities with my family, I have started to actively take part in planning it. It’s like re-knowing my family at different stages in life.”
     
            It would appear she isn’t alone. Xiaohongshu (or Little Red Book), a popular social media platform in China, found that 83% of those surveyed on their platform between the ages of 18-35 years old claimed that they were planning to take over this year’s Lunar New Year preparations at home.

            The survey also mentioned that young adults place enormous emphasis on recreating familiar flavors at their reunion dinners and splurging on retro items that remind them of their childhood during the Lunar New Year.
     
            Meanwhile, the state-run China Youth Daily carried out its own survey, reporting that 76.7% of the 1,333 people questioned said that they highly value the traditions and the yishi gan (a sense of ritual) of the Lunar New Year.
     
            More than 90% reportedly said they would insist on continuing the traditional customs of the festival such as cleaning up the house before the new year and putting on auspicious red banners on the walls.
     
            “When I was young, my father would lead my sister and me to put up red banners around our home,” recalls Song, who admits that she’s surprised to find herself more welcoming of Lunar New Year and its many traditions this year – a shift that hasn’t gone unnoticed.
     
            “Now, that task has been passed to my fiancé and me. My parents aren’t very expressive but I think it gave them comfort and joy seeing my change.”

            Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin had a message for the tens of thousands of fans who turned up to watch the band perform in Thailand last Saturday night.
     
            He really, really wants to play in China.
     
            “I promise we’ll play in China one day,” Martin said to the screaming crowd when he invited two lucky fans up on stage. He selected the duo, from the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, after spotting their banner in the crowd.
     
            “All I say is I promise we’ll play in China one day,” Martin said, before launching into the band’s 2015 hit, “Up and Up.”
     
            “Up and up, don’t ever give up. China loves Coldplay,” he sang.
     
            The crowd went wild.
     
            The moment, captured on camera and confirmed by CNN staffers who were in the audience at Bangkok’s Rajamangala Stadium on February 3, has become a huge talking point for the British band and their fans as they wrap up their tour of Asia.
     
            Martin had the same message for crowds in Tokyo in November – and even went further, hinting that the band lacks the approval of mainland Chinese authorities to perform there.
     
            “You know, we can’t get the permission (to play in China),” he told concertgoers.
     
            “Coldplay loves China… Please, universe! Let us play in China!”
     
            CNN has reached out to Coldplay and their representatives, and China’s Culture and Tourism Ministry for comment.
     
            China’s live music industry has risen rapidly to become one of the world’s largest in the past decade and for some foreign musicians, making their mark in the country remains a career goal.
     
            Chris Martin and Coldplay aren’t alone in wanting to serenade mainland Chinese audiences. Others, like Jon Bon Jovi, have in the past made their interest in touring the country quite known.
     
            In 2015, the Bon Jovi frontman took Mandarin singing lessons to cover a famous Chinese love song for Valentine’s Day – a shrewd PR move that won him praise and new Chinese fans.
     
            But the American rock star took a shot to the heart when organizers announced the cancellation of his band’s shows scheduled for Beijing and Shanghai that year.
     
            Bon Jovi’s management did not address media queries at the time but social media users speculated the decision may have stemmed from the band’s 2009 video for “We Weren’t Born to Follow,” which featured imagery of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. Others also pointed to a 2010 Bon Jovi gig in Tokyo that featured images of the Dalai Lama – Beijing’s bete noire – on the stage background.
     
            Two Bon Jovi gigs in the Chinese territory of Macao, which is governed under a separate system from the mainland, did however go ahead in 2015.

            American pop rock band Maroon 5 were also forced to cancel shows in Beijing and Shanghai in 2015. No official reason was given but many speculated that permits had been pulled over a band member wishing  the Dalai Lama happy birthday on social media.
     
            Similarly, promoters for Oasis said they were forced to cancel mainland China shows in 2009 after authorities reportedly discovered a member of the British rock band had played at a Tibetan Freedom gig two years earlier. The rest of the band’s Asia tour, including a concert in Hong Kong, went ahead as planned.
     
            But it hasn’t always been this way. Once a firm fixture on international tour circuits, especially in the run-up to and after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which presented the Chinese capital as a coveted stage venue to the world and signaled China’s prowess as a political, economic and cultural superpower.
     
            Much has changed since then, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping ushering in what many analysts say is a more authoritarian and internationally isolated era.
     
            Meanwhile, Covid-19 has also left its mark.
     
            China closed its borders for most of the pandemic and while it has since reopened, entering the country – let alone staging concerts – remains no easy feat.
     
            Logistical challenges like securing visas, obtaining permits and official approval, play a major role in the decision-making process for bands and their management.
     
            As a result, Chinese fans – like the duo Coldplay invited up on stage – must often travel overseas to catch some of the world’s biggest stars, with concerts in locations like Bangkok, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur often having sizable Chinese contingents.
     
            The opacity and unpredictability of Chinese authorities creates risks for international acts, many of whom have also noticeably skipped Hong Kong as well as mainland China on their Asia tours in the recent years.
     
            Canceling a concert would be the worst-case scenario for any band, as it creates an expensive logistical nightmare, organizers say. Tickets must be refunded and fan disappointment managed – and event organizers do not want to take these risks.

            China’s infamous censorship laws can also be a major turnoff for Western acts. The ruling Communist Party has long maintained a pervasive censorship system, covering everything from women’s cleavage to criticism of the political system and even jokes. But the level of oversight has ramped up under leader Xi.
     
            Chinese authorities have also been known to vet the content of shows, including setlists and lyrics. Those deemed to step over political red lines face severe consequences, particularly Chinese performers. 
 
            Musicians might also have political or ethical concerns about freedom of speech and human rights issues in China – so their decision to perform, or not, is often a personal and complex one for each musician. LGBTQ rights, for example, are often embraced by many Western acts but they remain a politically sensitive issue for China’s Communist Party.
     
            It is difficult to know whether any of Coldplay’s back catalogue or statements have alarmed Chinese authorities but the band has dipped its toes into geopolitics in the past.
     
            In October 2022, the band invited exiled Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani on stage during a gig in Buenos Aires to sing a song that had become an anthem for anti-government protests coursing through Iran at the time.
     
            “Young women and young people are fighting for their freedom, for the right to be themselves and we believe as a band that everybody should be able to be themselves as long as you don’t hurt anybody else,” Martin told the crowd at the time.
     
            Rhetoric like that during any concert in China would not go down well with authorities in a country where protests are quickly extinguished.
     
            In 2008, Icelandic singer Bjork was banned from China after she declared support for Tibet during a performance of her song her song “Declare Independence” at a Shanghai concert.
     
            Even a star’s actions outside of China can create hurdles. Justin Bieber was banned from entering the country in 2017 for “bad behaviors,” according to Beijing’s Municipal Bureau of Culture.
     
            “His series of misbehaviors while living abroad and during his performances in China has caused public resentment,” a statement from the bureau read. “To regulate the domestic entertainment market and purify its environment, we find it inappropriate to bring in performers with bad behaviors.”
     
Taiwan is another contentious issue that can ensnare musicians. Despite never having controlled the island, China’s Communist rulers view Taiwan as part of their territory and view any use of its flag as defiance.
     
            Singer Katy Perry found this out in 2017. Photos of her 2015 concert in Taiwan resurfaced, reminding Chinese authorities that she had worn a sunflower dress – a symbol of the island’s pro-democracy student protest movement – and draped Taiwan’s flag over her shoulders on stage. She was subsequently denied a China visa to perform at a fashion show.
     
            Never shy of controversy, pop diva Madonna pulled a similar stunt, wrapping herself in the island’s flag at her first Taiwan concert in 2016, angering – and alienating – fans in mainland China.

China lip-synch probe into top Taiwanese rock band is politically motivated, Taiwan intelligence officials claim
 
            In December, Taiwanese band Mayday – one of the most prominent rock groups in the Chinese-speaking world – found itself being investigated in China for alleged lip-synching during their recent tour of the mainland. Taiwanese intelligence alleged the investigation was politically motivated to coincide with the island’s presidential elections.
     
            Some performers have found a way to work within the constraints. Chinese censorship did not deter heavy metal legends Metallica when they played a series of 2017 concerts in China. Their setlists were reportedly submitted to the Chinese Culture Ministry for approval, which resulted in “Master of Puppets,” one of their biggest hits, being cut from shows.
     
            “Why shouldn’t you respect their culture when you’re there as a guest and been invited to play? We want to be respectful, and just because we do things differently, it doesn’t mean it should be forced upon (others),” frontman James Hetfield said in an interview with the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong at the time.
     
            “But hopefully we’ll keep coming back and they (the Chinese authorities) will realize we’re not a threat politically and have no agenda except to cross boundaries with music and let people enjoy the songs.”

            In photographer Zhang Xiao’s images of the Shehuo festival, an ancient celebration still observed in parts of northern China during the Lunar New Year, rural life comes alive with something altogether more fantastical.
     
            Villagers dressed as cranes, roosters and mythical lions pose for portraits standing amid crops or in fallow farmland. Costumed performers parade past brick houses against hazy backdrops, the eyes of their masks seemingly lost in thought. In a harvested wheat field, a group of almost a dozen men line up to hold aloft a colorful dragon puppet.
     
            In his new book “Community Fire,” Zhang said he wanted to capture the surreal “disconnect” between people’s everyday lives and the mythical personas they assumed.
     
            “Their characters seemed to come from the sky itself, and … formed a huge theatrical stage that transcended the confines of reality, transporting a collective of sleepwalkers to a dreamworld,” he wrote. “I wandered among them and photographed them quietly, because I did not want to wake them up.”
     
            Rooted in millennia-old agricultural practices of worshipping fire and the land, the folk rituals of Shehuo (often translated as “earth and fire”) traditionally entailed praying for good fortune and bounteous harvests, or to drive away demons. Festivities vary between regions but now typically see various performers, from stilt walkers to opera singers, parading through the streets or staging shows.

            Today, celebrations coincide with the Lunar New Year, which started on Saturday. As such, they have come to encompass many of the traditions — such as temple fairs and lion dances — practiced around China during this period. (Lunar New Year celebrations usually last more than two weeks, with Shehuo festival taking place on the season’s 15th and final day.)
     
            Shehuo celebrations have been recognized by the Chinese government in its UNESCO-style list of “intangible cultural heritage.” But the festival’s place in a rapidly urbanizing country remains under threat, said Zhang, adding that most of the performers he encountered had migrated to cities and only returned to their villages for the holiday.
     
            “The significance of traditional customs can no longer meet the needs of modern lives,” the photographer told CNN via email. “Today’s young people are more concerned about the internet and games. They are not even willing to try and understand traditional cultures. I think that’s sad.”
     
            Hoping to document the festival’s disappearing traditions — and the costumes and props associated with them — Zhang spent over a decade photographing Shehuo events at villages in Shaanxi and Henan provinces. A selection of the images, which were shot between 2007 and 2019, is currently on show in the US at Harvard University’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology (and over 100 of them were published in “Community Fire”).
     
            As well as capturing rites, rituals and folklore, the photos speak to the proliferation of mass-produced paraphernalia that has transformed the festival since the turn of the 21st century. One image depicts a stack of expressionless plastic masks; a set of 12 eerie pictures shows smiling prop heads hanging from trees in flimsy carrier bags.
     
            Several pages of Zhang’s book are dedicated to screengrabs of Alibaba-owned shopping platform, Taobao, where Shehuo items can be purchased at bargain prices. They range from an elaborate two-person lion dance costume, offered for just 360 yuan ($50), to a selection of headdresses priced under 17 yuan ($2.40).
     
            The rise of cheap goods and e-commerce has been a mixed blessing for these villages. Some of them — including Huozhuang, in Henan province, which features heavily in Zhang’s project — have taken advantage of the opportunity. The photographer visited and documented several small family workshops that buy semi-complete products in large quantities online before hand-finishing them and selling them on platforms like Taobao for profit.
     
            “In some villages, virtually the entire population has been mobilized to produce and sell Shehuo props,” the photographer writes in his book.
     
            But with economic opportunity comes a loss of traditional skills and customs. Materials like paper and bamboo have been replaced by cheap wire frames, plastic and synthetic fabrics, said Zhang, who grew up in a rural area of China’s Shandong province but is now based in Chengdu, one of the country’s largest metropolises in the southwest.
     
            A third-generation prop maker told Zhang that, in the photographer’s words, that he “lamented the gradual disappearance of traditional crafts.” But most of the villagers the photographer encountered were indifferent to the loss of cultural heritage, he claimed.

            And while Zhang, as a documentarian, assumed the role of a “quiet spectator” while on assignment, he nonetheless expressed regret at the festival’s rapid commercialization.
     
            “People are not focused on how to improve product quality and craftsmanship,” said the photographer, who is currently working on a documentary about life in rural China.
     
            “Instead, they are obsessed with how to manufacture these products as quickly as possible, and at the lowest cost, so as to gain an advantage against the competition. This has led to a gradual decline in product quality, and the entire industry has fallen into a vicious cycle of price wars.”

            The French offices of Chinese tech giant Huawei were searched this week, the company confirmed Friday, saying it was fully cooperating with the authorities.
     
            A French judicial source told CNN Thursday that the raid had been carried out as part of a preliminary probe launched by the financial prosecutor’s office over alleged “breach of probity,” a broad term concerning offenses such as acts of corruption, favoritism and influence peddling.
     
            The source did not provide any further details about the investigation. A preliminary investigation does not imply any wrongdoing.
     
            The Shenzhen-based firm told CNN that the search had taken place Tuesday.
     
            “Huawei has been in France for over 20 years, and has been in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable in the country. While Huawei France does not wish to comment on an ongoing investigation, the company remains confident about its conclusions,” a spokesperson said.
     
            In 2020, the company announced that it would build a factory in France making wireless communications equipment, with a €200 million ($215 million) investment and manufacturing €1 billion ($1.08 billion) worth of products annually. A number of European countries later either banned Huawei from their 5G telecom networks or restricted the company’s role in the networks.
     
Speaking to French public radio in December, Minggang Zhang, deputy general manager of Huawei France, said the factory would begin operations by the end of 2025 in the Alsace region.
     
            “Every year, we invest some €80 million or more in research in France,” Zhang told radio network France Inter. “France’s tech ecosystem is extremely innovative and dynamic.”
     
            He said the plant would supply the entire European market with 5G equipment and eventually create 500 jobs.

But the Argentine soccer idol’s failure to play in Hong Kong has unleashed a PR nightmare.","Feb 9, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Simone McCarthy,China,"

            For Lionel Messi, it should have been a few minutes of easy work.
     
            But the Argentine soccer idol’s failure to leave the substitutes’ bench in a routine preseason exhibition match has unleashed an unexpected public relations nightmare in one of the world’s most lucrative sports markets where, until now, he had enjoyed widespread popularity.
     
            The public backlash in China began Sunday when Messi didn’t appear for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami while in Hong Kong – and ramped up when he joined the team’s game in Japan just days later.
     
            Messi, who was declared unfit to play in Hong Kong, came on as a 60th minute substitute against Vissel Kobe in Tokyo on Wednesday – an appearance that seemed to energize his teammates before they lost on penalty kicks.
     
            Across social media in mainland China, scathing commentary on Messi was a dominant topic. One widely circulated video appears to show a blogger chopping up his collection of Messi jerseys with a pair of scissors.
     
            Many on Chinese social media platform Weibo questioned how the star was able to make such a quick recovery three days after the Hong Kong game. The sarcastic hashtag “medical miracle” trended high with more than 1.3 million views.
     
            Others lashed out against what they saw as disrespect for Hong Kong – and China.
     
            “Messi must give Chinese fans and the Chinese people an explanation,” one user wrote in a comment liked 59,000 times.
     
            “(He) played in five of the six preseason games and only missed the game in Hong Kong, China! Don’t come to China, China doesn’t welcome you,” another user wrote in a post liked by 20,000 others.

            The backlash facing Messi, who has a huge fanbase in China, follows a litany of instances where foreign celebrities or brands have sparked ire in the country for perceived affronts.
     
            The incident also comes as Hong Kong attempts to burnish its image as an international hub – even as it has come under increasing influence from mainland China, with Beijing tightening its control of the city and its government following mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.
     
            And it highlights both the political and financial risks major brands can face in the midst of such a backlash.
     
            As public – and official – anger mounted throughout the week, Hong Kong match organizer Tatler XFEST announced on Friday that it would refund 50% of the ticket price for fans, a move it said would cost the company $7.1 million and leave it facing nearly $5.5 million in losses.
     
            “We have invested millions of dollars and months of hard work into bringing a world-class event to Hong Kong, the city that is our home and where we have been headquartered for more than 45 years,” the company, which publishes multiple Tatler branded magazines across Asia, said in their statement.
     
            “Our aspiration was to create an iconic moment in support of the government’s efforts to remind the world how relevant and exciting Hong Kong is. That dream is broken today for us and all those who bought tickets to see Messi on the pitch,” the company added.
     
            After the Hong Kong game, frustration and disappointment from fans in the city ballooned into outrage across mainland China, as influential voices like Hong Kong lawmaker Kenneth Fok and mainland Chinese political pundit Hu Xijin condemned the behavior of the player and the team.
     
            “Why didn’t Messi play in Hong Kong or participate in the handshake with HK (the Hong Kong) chief executive? And why did he smile, run freely and looked fit in Japan?” Hu wrote on social platform X, referring to a moment during Sunday’s post-match trophy ceremony, as he called for an “explanation and apology.”
     
            The location of the match appeared to add a sting for many – given historic animosity and modern-day frictions between China and Japan.
     
            State-affiliated Global Times took the backlash a step further, on Wednesday night publishing an editorial noting a “theory” suggesting without evidence that Messi and Inter Miami’s actions could have been linked to efforts from “external forces” who wish to embarrass Hong Kong.
     
            The Chinese government has not commented on the incident.
     
            A statement released on Messi’s official Weibo social media account minutes before the start of the match in Tokyo appeared as an attempt to calm the backlash.
     
            “It was a real shame not to be able to play in Hong Kong the other day due to a groin injury that had swollen and I was in pain,” the post said, reiterating comments the player made to reporters in Tokyo Tuesday, adding that he hopes to return to both Hong Kong and mainland China.
     
            “Anyone who knows me knows that I always want to play, that’s what I always want, to do my best in any game. And especially in these games when we travel so far and fans are excited to see us attend the game healthily,” said the statement, posted in both Chinese and Spanish.
     
            But the statement’s IP address showed it was posted in China’s Sichuan province, some 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers) from Tokyo, fueling derision online. Major social media platforms in China require users to show their IP address location. “This is not sincere at all,” one Weibo user wrote in response.
     
            Other users were vitriolic. “Don’t ever come again if you can’t provide a reasonable explanation. You are polluting China’s air by being here. Support the Hong Kong government.”
     
            The situation is the latest example of how backlash against brands or celebrities can quickly snowball in China’s highly nationalistic social media sphere – in some cases with the potential for significant business ramifications in the country’s major consumer market.
     
            China’s so-called “wolf-warrior” diplomats and other government agencies have also made sharp public statements in such instances.

            In one such incident in 2019, the National Basketball Association appeared at risk of losing its lucrative footing in the country after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support for Hong Kong’s protesters.
     
            Soccer is a massively popular sport in China and major clubs will often incorporate stops in the country on what can be highly profitable pre-season tours.
     
            Ardent support for Messi gripped mainland China last summer after the Argentina national team played a friendly match against Australia in Beijing. That was the superstar’s seventh time in China, and his eighth could come in March when Argentina has two friendly matches scheduled in the country.  This week, the social media page of a Chinese liquor company whose product campaign features Messi was also inundated with comments calling for boycotts or “contract termination.”
     
            In addition to Messi, Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham has also been hit by the wave of backlash – with his verified Weibo account inundated with angry comments this week. CNN has approached Beckham for comment.
     
            Following the Hong Kong game, Inter Miami coach Gerardo “Tata” Martino explained the decision not to field Messi was made on very late notice and under the recommendation of the club’s medical staff. He also asked for fans’ forgiveness.
     
            In a statement, the club told CNN it understood the fans’ disappointment and were sorry that Messi and another marquee player, Luis Suárez, couldn’t play despite the team’s best intentions.
     
            But it added: “We do feel it necessary to express that injuries are unfortunately a part of the beautiful game, and our player’s health must always come first.”
     
            David Rowe, an emeritus professor at Western Sydney University focused on media and sport, said there could have been better communication with fans before and during the game.
     
            “Messi is a human being not a machine or a replicant. However, these games are not mainly about football, but promotional and commercial exercises,” he said.
     
            “In the case of Messi, is it more important that he performs in matches that mean very little in strict footballing terms, or preserves his body for actual competitive sport contests such as in MLS? Purist football fans would say the latter – but they are not the majority at touring exhibition games like this one.”
     
            The furor comes as Hong Kong officials aim to restore the city’s international image, which has been damaged by years of stringent anti-Covid controls and a crackdown on civil liberties following the mass and at times violent 2019 pro-democracy protests.
     
            The Inter Miami game was widely promoted by its organizer in the city for months, with Messi featured prominently in adverts. The sold-out game, with some tickets at eyewatering prices, featured as part of the city’s campaign to host “mega events” meant to drive a tourism rebound.
     
            The Hong Kong government has issued multiple statements expressing its “extreme” disappointment with the outcome as it scrambled to respond to public anger over Sunday’s match – and avoid becoming its target.
     
            On Wednesday after the Tokyo match, Hong Kong officials swiftly released a statement demanding Inter Miami explain how Messi appeared to have played so “actively and nimbly” at Japan’s National Stadium.
     
            Several pro-Beijing politicians also took to the internet to slam Messi.

            Among them, veteran lawmaker Regina Ip, also a top adviser to Hong Kong’s chief executive, called Messi’s snub “deliberate and calculated,” saying “his lies and hypocrisy are disgusting.” “Messi should never be allowed to return to Hong Kong,” she wrote on X.
     
            But some questioned whether such a response would help officials’ efforts to burnish Hong Kong’s appeal.
     
            “Although the government has tried hard to woo the world back, mood swings and occasional outbursts have the opposite effects, undermining confidence because the climate has become more volatile and less predictable,” said Kenneth Chan, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, who drew parallels to the so-called “wolf-warrior” rhetoric used by officials on the mainland.
     
            Many social media users in Hong Kong continued to criticize Messi and voice their frustration with the lost opportunity and perceived wasted funds, but others too questioned how the response would play out for the city.
     
            One social media user noted that it was not only Messi who played in Tokyo, but not Hong Kong. The Japanese capital is also hosting pop superstar Taylor Swift this week for one of only two Asia stops on her Eras Tour.
     
            “Tokyo is the real ‘capital of mega events,’” the user wrote.

            Travel across China ramped up in recent days as millions boarded trains and planes and braved heavily trafficked roads in what officials have estimated will be a record 9 billion trips surrounding the Lunar New Year on Saturday.
     
            Train stations, airports and highways were packed with travelers carting suitcases, provisions and gifts for family members in recent days as the weeks-long “chunyun” or Spring Festival travel rush period, which began late last month, got into full swing.
     
            Much of the “chunyun” travel sees workers leaving China’s prosperous large cities and returning to hometowns across smaller cities, towns and rural areas to celebrate with family and friends during an eight-day public holiday, which many extend.
     
            For many, this year – the Year of the Dragon according to the Chinese zodiac calendar – marks the return of normal travel for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began.
     
            China’s stringent coronavirus controls limited the movement of people across the country since 2020. Last year’s holiday took place just weeks after those measures were lifted, only to coincide with a wave of infections that complicated travel.
     
            This year, travelers were determined to make it back to see loved ones, even as blizzards and freezing rains across parts of eastern and central China earlier this week decimated flight and train schedules and left motorists stranded for hours on snowy highways.
     
            “Spring Festival is an important festival for Chinese people … People are more eager to go home to see their families and have a family reunion,” a Beijing worker surnamed Luo told CNN as he waited to board an 11-hour train to his hometown in southern Fujian earlier this week during those storms.
     
            Travel was expected to see a significant uptick this year. Authorities last month forecast that China’s population of 1.4 billion would take a record 9 billion trips during the 40-day holiday travel period, which began on January 26.
     
            Preliminary data released this week suggested that boom was in full swing.
     
            On Tuesday, three days ahead of Lunar New Year’s Eve, when families typically gather for a customary reunion meal, travelers made 2.2 million air trips and 12.9 million journeys by rail, according to official data.
     
            Both marked a significant rise from pre-pandemic travel – with flights up 17% and train rides up 23% from the comparable travel date in 2019, transport authorities said. More than 232 million trips were made that day overall, with similar figures recorded Wednesday and Thursday.
     
            Local data also showed a jump. On Friday, Shanghai’s major railway stations were expected to handle some 475,000 passengers – a more than 61% increase on 2019, according to the Shanghai-based state media outlet The Paper.
     
            Domestic flight volumes during the first week of the travel rush were up roughly 15% over the same period in 2019, the outlet also reported, citing a civil aviation publication.

            Robust travel could lend itself to “more buoyant consumption demand during the holidays,” HSBC economists said in a Thursday note.
     
            But the country is also celebrating the holiday amid growing uncertainty about the future of the economy, which has been rattled by a property market crisis, stock market meltdown, weaker exports and high youth unemployment over the past year.
     
            Turmoil in the stock market cast a shadow over the weeks leading up to the holiday. Two major indexes recorded their worst drops in years capping off a dire 2023 that saw China’s stock markets become the world’s worst performer.
     
            The government has been scrambling to revive public and investor confidence.
     
            Beijing fired its main stock market regulator Wednesday as anger grew over trillions wiped off shares in recent years, with desperate investors even flocking to the page of the United States Embassy in Beijing on Chinese social media platform Weibo earlier this month to vent their frustration and concern about what’s to come.
     
            Ahead of the holiday, China’s major state media publications highlighted a speech delivered by leader Xi Jinping during a political meeting Thursday, where he called for “Chinese people” to “forge ahead” in the Lunar New Year.
     
            “As long as we persist on our path, hold onto our will, remain consistent and join forces together, we can overcome all adversities and obstacles, and continue to move towards success,” Xi said, according to state media.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping heralded a new year of growing coordination with Russia during a call with counterpart Vladimir Putin on Thursday that comes as the two countries continue to cement their partnership amid frictions with the West.
     
            Xi told Putin the two sides should “strengthen strategic coordination” and “safeguard the national sovereignty, security and development interests of their respective countries,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.
     
            They should also “resolutely oppose external interference in their internal affairs,” Xi said, in an apparent reference to the two leaders’ shared suspicions about the activities of Western governments.
     
            The call, which comes ahead of China’s Lunar New Year on Saturday, is the latest robust exchange between the two leaders, who are seen to have a warm personal relationship and share an aim of pushing back against what they see as a world unfairly dominated by the United States.
     
            Their strengthening relationship in recent years has been closely watched by Western governments, in particular amid concerns that China could support Putin’s grinding war in Ukraine.
     
            China claims impartiality in that conflict but has refused to condemn the illegal invasion and acted as an increasingly critical lifeline for the sanctions-hit Russian economy.
     
            “We have withstood many trials and tribulations together (in the past). Looking to the future, China-Russia relations face new development opportunities,” Xi told Putin during their call.
     
            The leaders also had a “detailed exchange” on the situation in several regions, including the Middle East, and discussed “the current situation” in Ukraine, according to a readout from the Kremlin.
     
            In the Middle East, “both Russia and China support a political and diplomatic settlement of the Palestinian problem within the generally recognized framework of international law,” the Kremlin statement said.

            The Chinese readout did not name Ukraine or the Middle East, where instability is growing on the back of the on-going conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. It said the two sides discussed “international and regional hot-spot issues.”
     
            Beijing has criticized Israel’s response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attack, and has backed a two-state solution to establish an independent Palestinian state as a way to resolve the conflict.
     
            Both Beijing and Moscow are seen to have increased their coordination on international issues in forums like the United Nations in recent years, while also building separate international groupings where they hold sway such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).
     
            Xi and Putin both called for further enhancing their international “multilateral” coordination during the call, the readouts said, mentioning the BRICS and SCO, both of which have expanded their membership over the past year. Russia assumed the rotating annual chair of BRICS earlier this year.
     
            “Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping specifically stressed that close Russia-China interaction is an important stabilizing factor in world affairs,” the Kremlin readout said.
     
            The leaders also hailed record trade, which last year exceeded a target of $200 billion ahead of schedule. Those ties have been buoyed by discount Russian oil purchases from China and sanctions-hit Russia’s increasing reliance on Chinese consumer goods amid its economic isolation.
     
            Putin also praised the Russia-China trade relationship during an interview with American right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson published Thursday.
     
            “Our trade is well-balanced, mutually complementary in high-tech, energy, scientific research and development,” Putin said in his remarks, where he referred to Xi as a “colleague and friend,” according to a translation provided by Carlson.
     
            Putin has an arrest warrant against him issued by the International Criminal Court over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. And on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the Russian president should face a war crimes inquiry for Moscow’s brutal assault on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which killed thousands of people, destroyed countless buildings and was followed by a widespread campaign of Russification.
     
            Thursday’s phone conversation between Xi and Putin took place as the two countries celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations this year.
     
            Last year, Xi made his symbolically significant first foreign trip of his third term as president to Moscow last March. Putin made one of just a handful of overseas trips since the start of the war in Ukraine to Beijing in October.

Check out this list of essential dishes that will give you a well-rounded culinary experience.,"Feb 8, 2024",2024-10-15 10:35:31.706492,China News,Maggie Hiufu Wong,China,"
            With one of the world’s most diverse food scenes, China makes it nearly impossible to put together one single list that truly encompasses the “best” Chinese dishes.
     
            But with such a huge variety of flavors on offer, it’s immensely helpful to go into the country with an introductory list of essential eats that will give you a well-rounded culinary experience. 
     
            Below are some of the can’t-miss dishes.
     
            We have included both English and Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese, depending how they are more commonly known) names in this story. 
     
            One bite into this small mountain of crispy duck skin, juicy meat, radish, cucumber, scallion and sweet bean sauce wrapped neatly in a thin pancake, and you’ll understand why Peking duck has been captivating stomachs – including those of ancient Chinese emperors – for centuries. 
     
            It’s said that roasted duck first started tantalizing taste buds more than 1,500 years ago in Nanjing, when the city was the seat of ancient Chinese imperial regimes.
     
            The capital relocated to Beijing in the 1400s, and the imperial families brought those tasty roast duck recipes – and the chefs – with them.
     
            It was there that the current way we enjoy the duck, wrapped in that delicate thin pancake, was invented and then popularized around the world.
     

Duck de Chine: Beijing's best Peking duck? 
 
            Many Nanjing residents will indeed tell you it’s their city – not Beijing – that’s the true duck capital of China.
     
            The city’s obsession with the bird is evident in its wide array of duck offerings, including salted duck, pancakes made with duck grease and duck dumplings.
     
            But nothing speaks to a duck lover’s heart quite like a cheap bowl of vermicelli soup with duck blood. 
     
            Made with duck-bone broth, duck blood curds and bits of duck offal, such as liver and gizzards, this street food dish fully utilizes every part of the bird to deliver incredibly intense flavors.
     
            It may look simple, but steaming fish is a difficult art to master.
     
            Timing is crucial. The number of minutes – or seconds – you should steam a fish is dictated by the type and size of a fish, as well as the strength of your own stove. 
     
            Undercook it by a minute, the flesh won’t detach from the bone; overcook it, the flesh will tighten too much and the fish will lose some of its moisture, tenderness and flakiness. 
     
            Cantonese steamed fish is usually served in some sweetened soy sauce and scallions. 
     

50 of the world's best desserts
 
            It’s nearly impossible to dislike China’s soul-comforting dan dan mian, or dan dan noodles. The question is: Which version to try?
     
            Dan dan noodles are named after the way they were originally sold more than 100 years ago – on a dan dan, a carrying pole, by street hawkers. 
     
            There are many ways to serve this famous Sichuan specialty. Some think dan dan noodles should contain a dry mix of noodles, made with minced meat, chopped scallions, spices, crushed peanuts and various sauces. Others disagree, preferring dan dan noodles in a hot, spicy, salty and nutty broth albeit with similar ingredients.
     
            But most people would agree that dan dan noodles taste better when topped with a handful of rou saozi – finely chopped pork that’s been pan-fried in lard until golden brown and crispy.
     
            Cuisine in the mountainous, landlocked southern province of Hunan (also known as Xiang cuisine) is often cooked with a generous portion of oil, salt and chili. 
     
            The province even has its own chili-themed folk song, with lyrics proclaiming that “it doesn’t count as a dish if there is no chili. A touch of chili triumphs over an exquisite meal.” 
     
            No other dish represents Hunan cuisine as well as steamed fish heads served with chopped salted chili (duo jiao yu tou).
     
Duo jiao, a staple relish in Hunanese homes, is made with chili peppers that are dried, diced then preserved in a jar of salt, ginger, garlic and baijiu (Chinese liquor) for at least a week. 
     
            The thick blanket of duo jiao gives the steamed fish head a salty and spicy kick. The leftover juice is a delicious dip for noodles or dumplings after you’ve devoured the fish.
     
            Warning: Once you’ve tried a Cantonese-style, woodfire oven-roasted goose, there’s no going back. No other goose dish will please your palate in quite the same way. 
     
            Upon hitting your mouth, the goose magically falls apart, offering an explosion of combined flavors from the crispy skin, melted fat and tender meat. 
     
            Some restaurants will use special types of wood, such as camphor wood or lychee wood, to give the bird a special smoky taste.
     
            Seaside Chaozhou is known for no-frills seafood dishes that serve one purpose – to maximize the fresh ingredients’ original umami flavors. 
     
            Among the best dishes showcasing this style is Chaozhou-style cold fish or cold crab. 
     
            To preserve the freshness of the seafood, fish and crabs are lightly seasoned in salt before they’re steamed.  They’re then cooled and served at room temperature.
     
            The fish is often dipped in a special soy bean paste from Poling, while the crabs are served with a garlic and vinegar sauce.
     
            Legend has it that cross-the-bridge rice noodles were invented many years ago by a loving wife. Her husband studied on an island, so the wife would travel across a bridge to deliver him his daily lunches. 
     
            As the food would be cold after the journey, the disheartened wife decided to bring a pot of scalding hot chicken broth, along with the rice noodles and raw ingredients. 
     
            It was an ingenious plan, really. The chicken oil on the surface of the soup would keep the liquid warm. When the husband was ready to eat, she’d cook all the ingredients by pouring them into the hot soup.
     
            Today, many noodle shops offer their own style of cross-the-bridge rice noodles, offering a choice of different ingredients and soup bases.
     
            One of the most internationally famous Chinese dishes, Kungpao chicken is made by stir-frying diced chicken pieces with scallions, ginger, peppercorns, chili and deep-fried peanuts. 
     
            There are different origin stories, but many believe the dish was inspired by a former Sichuan governor in the 1800s called Ding Baozeng, whose nickname was Ding Gongbao – alternatively romanized as Kungpao. 
     
            It’s said that Ding loved a sour and salty fried chicken dish from China’s Shandong province. After he was relocated to Sichuan, he asked his chef to add some local chili and peanuts to the dish – and the rest is history.
     

50 of the best street foods in Asia
 
            Deep-fried pork can feel a bit heavy, especially in unforgiving summer weather. Thankfully, we have sweet and sour pork.
     
            The pineapple in the dish and a sauce made with sugar, vinegar and soy sauce add some freshness to the crispy pork.
     
            If you’re a fan of sweet and sour pork, you should also try the Fujian version of the dish – lychee pork. By incising the surfaces of the pork pieces, they resemble lychees’ uneven skins after being deep-fried. 
     
            There is no lychee in the dish traditionally – the sweetness comes from sugar, but some restaurants add lychee or use lychee sauce to match its name.
     
            Bonus: The rugged surfaces on the pork hold more sauce and have a more tender texture.
     
            Who needs French fries when you have dumplings? 
     
            Whether you love them steamed, boiled or pan-fried, jiaozi pack a full punch of carbs, proteins and vegetables in one mouthful. 
     
            Vinegar and chili oil are some of the best condiments to go with Chinese dumplings.
     
            One of the most interesting styles of dumplings is Fujian’s rouyan version – delicious enough to earn their own spot on this list.  
     
            The mini pork dumplings have an extra chewiness to them as their wrappers are made of pork and some flour. 
     

The world's tastiest dumplings
 
            While Hainanese chicken rice isn’t actually from China’s Hainan province (it was first served in Malaysia), the dish was inspired by the tropical island province and its famous Wenchang chicken. 
     
            Made with a special breed of poultry from the island’s eponymous city, Wenchang chicken is prized for its thin skin, tender meat and sweet flavor.  
     
            The most common way to cook a Wenchang chicken is by blanching and air drying it. Similar to Hainanese chicken rice, the Wenchang version is often served with yellow chicken fat rice and chicken soup. 
     
            Hainan locals usually prefer garlic and ginger paste, chili sauce and the juice of small tangerines as condiments.
     
            A memorable mapo tofu packs a boatload of zing – salty, peppery and spicy flavors should all hit the taste buds in a single spoonful thanks to the different types of spices, peppers and chili used in the dish. 
     
            Discerning local gourmets insist that the best mapo tofu should be made with Hanyuan peppercorns and broad bean chili paste from Sichuan’s Pidu district.
     
            It’s most commonly cooked with minced pork or beef – and tofu, of course. But as the Sichuan dish is so wildly popular nowadays, restaurants often serve creative versions of mapo tofu with different types of meats.
     
            Tender, well-braised pork belly is naturally irresistible – but the star of this Hakka dish is actually mei cai, a dry, pickled Chinese mustard that gives the hearty stew its sour and salty taste.
     
            It’s said that every Hakka family, a traditionally nomadic tribe in China, pickle their own mei cai. 
     
            When they make too much of it, they will whip up a mei cai relish that’s a great topping for plain rice and noodles.
     
            Whether it’s an elevated version made with diced abalone and truffles, or a leftover medley of soon-to-spoil ingredients from your fridge, every good version of classic fried rice shares two important ingredients – dry but succulent rice and wok hei (also known as the breath of the wok).  
     
            One of the most welcome sights on a cold morning in Tianjin in northern coastal China is a jian bing stand, with its sizzling hot pan.
     
Jian bing guozi is composed of two elements: Jian bing (crepes) and guozi (deep-fried crisps).
     
            To make a jian bing guozi, first, a mung bean mixture is fanned out with a ladle onto a flat-iron pan. Eggs and scallions are then spread out on the crepe. 
     
            After the pancake is flipped over, a dollop of bean paste, sheets of guozi crisps (or, sometimes, deep-fried breadsticks and vegetables) are added before the vendor – usually an elderly man – folds the stuffed and toasted pancake and hands it to you in a paper bag.
     

Breakfast around the world: How different places start the day
 
            Wondering whether the xiaolongbao wrapper will break on the long journey between the steaming basket and your mouth is one of the most suspenseful moments that can take place at a dining table.
     
            Amassing a huge following in and outside China, xiaolongbao, also called xiaolong tangbao (translated as “small basket soup bun”), is a mix of soup and pork packed inside a thin dumpling wrapper. 
     
            In addition to pork, the soupy dumplings can also be filled with crab meat and crab roe.
     
            If you’re one of those people who thinks the real star of beef chow fun is the noodles and not the beef, you should try Chen cun fen (Chen village flat rice noodles). 
     
            Chewier, wider and thinner than the usual flat rice noodles, Chen cun fen is a specialty from Chen village, a town in Shunde district in the Pearl River Delta. 
     
            In addition to being stir-fried in a noodle dish, the semi-translucent and smooth Chen cun fen make a great base layer for dishes such as steamed spareribs and seafood as the noodles absorb all the flavors from the other ingredients. 
     
            Named after famous poet, painter and statesman Su Dongpo (who lived about 1,000 years ago), Dongpo rou is made up of braised pork belly, rock sugar, soy sauce, yellow wine and other seasonings.
     
            The result is a richly flavored and extremely tender pork slab that can easily be pried apart with chopsticks. 
     
            It’s a delicious dish that goes well with steamed white rice.
     
            Surprisingly, China’s famed hot and sour soup isn’t just great at warming up your body in winter. 
     
            Local Sichuanese believe that the soup can also expel excessive humidity and hotness from one’s body in summer as well.
     
            A bowl of hot and sour soup should have a balance of sourness (from vinegar) and spiciness (from peppers) – but not hotness from chili. 
     
            Shreds of tofu, Chinese mushrooms, wood ears and bamboo shoots are some of the common ingredients found in the thick soup.
     
Dim sum refers more to a style of serving food – it’s a type of meal in Cantonese food culture – rather than a specific dish. 
     
            It’s a cunning way to include many different varieties of small plates – from pan-fried radish cake to prawn dumplings to siu mai – in one meal. 
     
            At the same time, dining on a combination of these dishes during a dim sum session is far more enjoyable than eating just one version on its own. 
     
            Don’t be fooled by its bland-sounding Chinese name – shui zhu, which translates literally to “water boil.” 
     
Shui zhu is a cooking technique that was first developed in Sichuan cuisine. The word water (shui) refers to the hot, spicy chili oil broth that is used to poach thinly sliced beef (shui zhu niu), pork (shui zhu roupian) or fish (shui zhu yu).
     
            Today, the photogenic crowd-pleaser is often served with sliced celtuce (a type of lettuce) and flat mung bean noodles in the broth, too.
     
            The best barbecue pork should be slightly charred on the outside and contain just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness from the maltose, wine and soy sauce.
     
            A Cantonese roast shop will let you choose the level of fattiness you want in your char siu, Cantonese for barbecue pork.
     
            Half lean, half fatty char siu is the go-to option if you are a newbie.
     
            Barbecue pork is a highly versatile ingredient served in many delicious dishes – from char siu macaroni soup for breakfast to char siu bao – steamed buns -- at dim sum.
     

Women were once deemed too weak to work in Chinese restaurant kitchens. These chefs are proving doubters wrong 
 
Bao – a steamed bread roll filled with a variety of ingredients including meat or vegetables – come in many shapes and sizes.
     
            It could be a plain bao with a glossy and smooth exterior (mantou), or an oversized steamed volcano-shaped bao stuffed with an entire meal’s worth of food (da bao, or translated as “big bao”).
     
            But one of the best baos is undoubtedly sheng jian bao.  
     
            The pan-fried bao is filled with pork and broth, while scallions and white sesame seeds are sprinkled on top.
     
            The Mausoleum of Terracotta Warriors is usually the reason travelers visit Xi’an, but this western Chinese city’s delicious and similarly historical rou jia mo is another great reason to head there.
     
            The ubiquitous street eat consists of a grilled mo (flat bread) and an overflowing amount of shredded pulled pork belly that has been braised in soy sauce, rock sugar and spices such as cinnamon, star anise, cloves and peppercorns for hours.
     
            Undercooked mo is a big no-no. A common saying in Shaanxi province goes “tie quan hu bei juhua xin,” which means “iron ring, tiger’s back and chrysanthemum’s heart ” – the perfect patterns you should look for on a well toasted mo.
     
            Cantonese parents are the real experts when it comes to therapeutic herbal soups, which are simmered for hours to infuse the liquid with healing qualities and deliciousness.  
     
            Various seasonal ingredients offer different cooling or warming qualities to restore balance in the body.
     
            For example, apple, snow fungus and lily petal soup will hydrate your body, whereas winter melon and barley soup will cool you down in hot weather.
     
            The Chinese version of salami is often categorized into two main types: Laap cheung and yun cheung (in Cantonese).
     
Laap cheung is preserved meat sausage that has a slightly sweet taste. Yun cheung, on the other hand, is mostly made with offal from poultry, giving it a stronger and gamier flavor.
     
            Unlike their European counterparts, Chinese preserved sausages should be steamed before eaten. 
     
            You can find them wrapped in buns, stir-fried with sticky rice or steamed in a clay pot. 
     
            The secret to a delicious Fujian-style taro paste is binlang yu, a special breed of yam from Fujian’s Fuding county. The white and purple flesh of a binlang yu has vibrant fragrances and an earthy, nutty and sweet taste.
     
            To make the dessert, the taro is cooked and mashed before it’s mixed with sugar and lard. 
     
            The thick, silky taro mash will then be garnished with sweet toppings such as dates, candied cherries and gingko.
     

How 'bland' tofu became one of the world's hottest foods 
 
            When it comes to nourishing your digestive system, in sickness and in health, it’s all about congee (porridge, commonly made with rice).
     
            A popular breakfast item in many parts of China, the versatile cheap eat can be served plain with a drizzle of soy sauce and scallions, or stewed with savory ingredients such as chicken or fish. 
     
            Lean pork floss and century egg congee is one of the classics served in the south of China. Congee made with millet instead of rice and flavored with pumpkin is popular in the north.
     
            Those who are extra hungry can order a side of soy sauce-fried noodles, deep-fried breadsticks (youtiao) or soy milk. These can be enjoyed on the side, or you can tear up the breadsticks or add some noodles to the congee. 
     
            Most people who visit Chaozhou can’t resist picking up a family-sized bag of super bouncy and flavorsome meat balls made of beef beaten by hand to bring home with them.
     
            Highly praised for their understanding of beef, Chaozhou people are also famous for other dishes such as beef hot pot.
     
            One of the most loved desserts in China, sweet rice balls, or tangyuan, can be found in many regions. 
     
            Ningbo is one of the best places to sample these round mochi-like desserts. 
     
            The soft, pillowy exterior is made with sticky rice while the filling is made of black sesame, sugar and lard. 
     
            The lard gives the filling an extra fragrance and sheen.

            China’s consumer prices slid deeper into deflationary territory last month, suffering their biggest drop since the global recession in 2009 and underscoring the huge challenges facing the economy.
     
            The country’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped by 0.8% in January from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday. It was the steepest fall since September 2009 and marks a fourth straight month of decline.
     
            But analysts say the sharp drop was largely due to seasonal factors and the downturn may have already bottomed out.
     
            The NBS, as well as some economists, said holiday demand in January 2023, when CPI rose 2.1%, played a part in making prices this year look particularly weak.
     
            “[The] Lunar New Year falls in February this year compared with the end of January last year, causing distortions to the base,” HSBC economists said in a research note on Thursday.
     
            Beijing is scrambling to revive consumer and investor confidence as it fights fires on several fronts, including a real estate slump, stock market meltdown and weaker exports. It fired its main stock market regulator Wednesday as anger grew over trillions wiped off shares in recent years.
     
            Weak consumer demand last month also weighed on prices, the economists said.
     
            Food prices in particular were a major drag on the index. The price of pork, a staple in the Chinese diet, plunged by 17.3% from a year ago, marking the biggest drop among all consumption items. Vegetable prices slid nearly 12%.
     
            The Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the cost of goods that factories charge wholesalers, decreased by 2.5% in January from a year ago, the NBS data showed. That was a slight pick up from December’s 2.7% drop.
     
            Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Economics, says consumer prices are likely to rise from February onwards.
     
            “The base effects makes January’s data look worse than they are. Sequential data paints a more upbeat picture,” Song said.
     
            Compared to December, the CPI actually rose by 0.3% in January, up for a second month in a row.
     
            Prices are also likely to be driven by strong holiday demand this month, as the country celebrates the Lunar New Year, the most important and festive holiday, starting Saturday.
     
            Millions of people will flock home to see their families for the holiday, in the world’s largest annual human migration. The migration is officially called the “Spring Festival Travel Rush” in China and often lasts 40 days.
     
            “Keep in mind, this will be the first Lunar New Year to fully shake off the impact of Covid-19,” said the HSBC economists.
     
            Preliminary data suggests more people are traveling now than before the pandemic.
     
            On Tuesday, the 12th day of the travel rush, 2.2 million trips were made by air and 12.9 million trips by rail, according to figures from the Chinese transport ministry. The figures have jumped 17% and 23%, respectively, from 2019.
     
            “This could point to more buoyant consumption demand during the holidays,” the HSBC economists said.
     
            Prices for consumer services have risen in tandem. Tourism-related prices were up 1.8% in January from a year ago, according to the NBS on Thursday.
     
            “We expect consumption to continue to be a pillar of support for the economy this year, with the strength in services consumption broadening out to more durable goods consumption,” the HSBC economists said.

            Grab your camera and slap on something flame resistant, it’s time to witness one of China’s most incredible displays – the fire dragon dance.
     
            The dragon, a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture, is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals.
     
            Dragon dances have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE), while fire dragon dances began appearing in records during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and in the Republican era (1912-1949). Some historians say fire dragon dances date back even further, to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
     
            “These dances served purposes such as celebrating festivals and warding off plagues,” says Kwok Kam Chau, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University whose research focuses on festivals and religion in Chinese societies.
     
            Kwok and his colleague, professor Chung Po Yin, have spent the last few years studying fire dragon dances.

            “Throughout Chinese history, there are records of dragon worship ceremonies, yet they were associated with ‘water’ rather than ‘fire.’ In ancient times, people worshipped dragons to beseech for rain. This belief stems from folk religion, and Buddhist and Taoist belief, where dragons are revered as river gods or rain deities.”
     
            From an anthropological perspective, he says the fire dragon procession route holds great significance “as it exemplifies the local villagers’ perception of their community and its geopolitical ties,” says Kwok.
     
            Today, fire dragon dances take place all over the country as part of Spring Festival/Lunar New Year festivities, but performances differ in shapes and forms.
     
            We’ve pulled together a selection of top options for travelers looking to experience this fiery Chinese tradition in person.
     
            Puzhai Village, located in Fengshun County in Guangdong province, has been hosting fire dragon dance shows every year during China’s Lantern Festival, which falls on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year (February 24 this year), since the Qing Dynasty.
     
            The centuries-old tradition was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage of China in 2008.
     
            As the firecrackers are lit, a flurry of shirtless men rush into the village plaza, all working together to hoist a dancing dragon that’s over 30 meters long and is covered in fireworks that make its body sparkle brightly.
     
            The event usually begins with various fireworks displays and performances,   before a village elder lights the fireworks that are set along the livery of the colorful dragon, bringing the festivity to its climax.
     
            The Steel Fire Dragon Dance has been performed in different towns in China’s Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, in Hunan province, for centuries.
     
            Observed annually during the Lantern Festival, the dance is believed to bring good weather and abundant harvests in the coming year.
     
            It often begins with a cacophony of drums and gongs, firecrackers and cheers from onlookers. Then, fireworks shoot out from the many bamboo pipes that flank the dance route, as dozens of dragon dancers brave the sparks that rain down.
     
            Some of the dances end by running the dragon into a river, others aren’t over until the dragon is completely burnt out, its metal structure all that remains.
     
            Once feared a dying tradition, the dance has been revived thanks to the enthusiastic locals who tirelessly promoted it online by sharing dramatic images and clips of the event.
     
            The Steel Fire Dragon dance was added to China’s list of intangible cultural heritage in 2018.
     
            To see a majestic fire dragon dance against a historical backdrop, head to Huanglongxi in Sichuan province.
     
            Filled with ancient architecture from the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912), this historic old town in the city of Chengdu is known for its many temples, making it a popular destination during Lunar New Year.
     
            Every year, the town hosts a multi-day Lunar New Year fair by the pier that includes a fire dragon dance on each of the first five days (February 10-14, 2024) as well as the 15th day (February 24, 2024) of the lunar month.
     
            No firecrackers here. Instead, molten iron lava is thrown into the air. As the lava cools and sends sparkles into the air, the dragon “pursues” a lantern, creating a spectacular show.
     
            The Tongliang Fire Dragon in Chongqing province is undoubtedly one of the grandest fire dragon dance performances of them all. As droplets of molten iron are shot into the sky and light up the darkness, the shadow of the fire dragon swirls around majestically.
     
            Dubbed the hometown of the fire dragon, Tongliang district now takes the show on the road, hosting dances in other parts of Chongqing. But one of the top places to take it in is Qicaimeng Park.
     
            Every night from February 10 to 17, 2024, the park will showcase a 50-minute show that includes the Tongliang Fire Dragon. There will also be other illumination displays and fairs going on within the park.
     
            The Ancient Town of Liu Long, in Dafang County in Guizhou province, kicks off its annual Dragon Lantern Festival on the ninth day of the lunar month (February 18, 2024).
     
            Instead of lighting the dragon on fire, Dafang’s version features an elaborate and colorful lantern that’s lit from within.
     
            Dozens of firecrackers are laid on the ground to create a glittery display around the parade route as dancers move around the town’s plaza with their dragon.

            The Chinese hackers behind a campaign to infiltrate transportation hubs and other critical American infrastructure have had access to some of their targets’ computer networks for “at least five years,” according to a new report by US and allied security agencies obtained by CNN.
     
            The campaign is part of a long-running effort by the hackers to position themselves for potentially crippling cyberattacks that could disrupt water and electricity, according to US officials.
     
            US intelligence chiefs sounded the alarm about the threat to Congress last week, saying Beijing could use the hackers to disrupt a US response if China invades Taiwan. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last week that the hackers could “wreak havoc and cause real-world harm” to the US.
     
            The nearly 50-page report comes as US-China tensions over Taiwan and other key issues remain high and shows how central cyber operations could be to Chinese efforts to hobble US infrastructure in the event of a conflict between the two superpowers, according to US officials. The report would be the most detailed disclosure yet by the US government of the hackers’ stealthy techniques, one aimed at helping private owners of critical infrastructure spot the Chinese hackers in their networks.
     
            The hackers’ presence in critical US networks has sparked a monthslong effort by US national security officials to kick the hackers out.
     
            The report, which US officials are set to release this week, makes clear that the Chinese hackers’ activity began much earlier than previously known, with the hackers scoping and accessing IT systems years ago. From there, they have spent months looking for ways to maneuver onto more sensitive industrial systems that help control power flow and water.
     
            The Beijing-backed hackers have been probing systems that control heating, cooling and water, access that, if exploited, could allow them to manipulate those systems and cause “significant infrastructure failures,” the report says. The hackers have also broken into security cameras at unnamed critical facilities, according to the document.
     
            There are no signs yet that China has decided to use the hackers’ presence to disrupt US infrastructure, according to US officials, but they are concerned that could change quickly in the event of a crisis.
     
            Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, denied the US hacking allegations in a statement to CNN on Wednesday and accused Washington of conducting its own cyberattacks.
     
            The new report also sheds new light on the sprawling nature of the hacking operation and on concerns from US allies over the activity.
     
            US officials have confirmed the hackers have broken into computer networks at energy, transportation and water facilities in the “continental and non-continental” US and its overseas territories, including Guam, according to the report. In one case, after breaching the IT systems at an unnamed water facility, the hackers had access to a range of critical information on water treatment plants and water wells, according to the analysis.
     
            The FBI, National Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are among the US agencies that produced the report, along with cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. CNN obtained a non-public version of the report, and sources familiar with the report told CNN the agencies are preparing to publish a version of it this week.
     
            Canada’s cybersecurity agency “assesses that the direct threat to Canada’s critical infrastructure” from the Chinese hackers “is likely lower” than that to US infrastructure, but that Canada would still likely still be affected by a disruption to US infrastructure due to “cross-border integration,” the document says. Australia and New Zealand, two key allies in the US quest to counter China in the Pacific, could be vulnerable to similar activity from Chinese government hackers, the report says.

            For the past two decades, the United States imported more goods from China than all other nations. That’s no longer the case.
     
            Mexico is now the top exporter of goods into the US, according to new trade data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday.
     
            Mexico sent $475.6 billion worth of goods into the US last year, a 5% increase from 2022. China, meanwhile, exported $427.2 billion worth of goods to the US last year, a 20% slump from 2022.
     
            As a whole, the total US trade deficit in goods and services — a measure of the difference between exports and imports — was $773.4 billion last year, a 19% decline from 2022. That’s the largest annual decline in the trade deficit since 2009.
     
            Contributing to the overall trend was a weaker dollar that’s made the cost of US goods cheaper abroad, Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note Wednesday.

            Brad Setser, an economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested in a post on X that tariffs the Trump administration put in place have negatively impacted the amount of goods the US imports from China.
     
            At the same time, Americans have been dialing back on purchases of goods such as electronics that are widely produced in China since supply chain bottlenecks cleared up after the pandemic took hold. In turn, more spending has shifted to services like travel and entertainment.

            China has replaced the head of its securities regulator, as public anger over the meltdown in the stock market grows.
     
            Wu Qing, a banking veteran and most recently the deputy party secretary of Shanghai, was named as chairman and party secretary of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), replacing Yi Huiman, who assumed the role in January 2019, according to a state news agency Xinhua report on Wednesday.
     
            Wu, 59, was also the chairman of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in mainland China, between 2016 and 2018. He had previously worked with financial regulators for two decades, including at the CSRC.
     
            Chinese stock markets have stabilised this week but they had a dire 2023 and have been the world’s worst performer this year. By Monday, about $6.1 trillion in market value had been wiped from the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets since their recent peaks in February 2021.
     
            Tens of thousands of Chinese people have flocked to a social media account of the US Embassy in Beijing to vent their anger and frustration about the stock market, after other outlets of protest had been closed off.
     
            Officials are scrambling to draw a line under the market rout.
 
            On Tuesday, Central Huijin Investment, the equity arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, said it would step up buying shares. Shortly after the announcement, the CSRC issued a statement saying it “firmly supports” Central Huijin Investment in its plan.
     
            On Wednesday, mainland Chinese stock markets logged a second straight day of gains. The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 1.4%, while the Shenzhen Component Index jumped 2.9%.
     
            The redoubled attempts to rescue Chinese stocks appear to have bought Beijing some more time, but they don’t address the underlying challenges the economy faces — weak demand, deflationary pressures, a crashed real estate sector, and rising trade tensions with the United States.
     
            A previous brief period of market calm following soothing words from Beijing was brought to an abrupt end late last month when a Hong Kong court ordered Evergrande, the poster child of China’s property crisis, to liquidate. That sent investors running for the exits again.

            China is promising to help its electric vehicle (EV) makers cope with international trade restrictions and build overseas supply chains, as part of a major global expansion effort for the industry.
     
            The pledge comes as China’s booming EV exports face increasing protectionist pushback in some regions, including Europe and the United States.
     
            On Wednesday, China’s Commerce Ministry posted a document signed late last year by nine government agencies, including the Foreign Ministry and the central bank, vowing to support Chinese EV makers with their globalization push.
     
            Among the 18 measures laid out in the document, the agencies said they will help Chinese companies “actively respond” to foreign trade restrictions.
     
            “[We] need timely tracking of policies and regulations related to market access, environmental protection, data protection, IP protection, and to compile and issue country-specific trade guidelines,” the document said.
     
            It also encouraged Chinese EV companies to cooperate with foreign manufacturers in technology and build supply chains that can benefit everyone.
     
            The agencies also pledged to help Chinese companies improve their overseas compliance capabilities.
     
            Chinese EV makers are taking the world by storm, even if they are largely locked out of key markets like the United States. Their cars, which are cheaper than models built elsewhere, have made inroads in Europe, Australia and Southeast Asia.
     
            Last year, Chinese firms shipped more than 1.2 million new energy vehicles to the rest of the world, up 77% from 2022, according to data from the China Association of Auto Manufacturers.
     
            That helped China surpass Japan as the world’s top vehicle exporter for the first time, according to data from industry groups. In 2023, China exported a total of 4.91 million vehicles, surpassing Japan’s 4.42 million, the CAAM figures showed. (Official customs data from China and Japan suggest the latter is still the world’s top car exporter.)
     
            Chinese EV makers are seeking alternative growth engines overseas because the picture is gloomy at home. The domestic economy has lost momentum, and a price war has intensified due to too much competition.
     
BYD, the Shenzhen-based manufacturer, overtook Tesla (TSLA) as the world’s top seller of EVs at the end of last year, crowning an extraordinary rise for the Chinese carmaker. The company plans to expand its supply chain in Europe, announcing in January that it would build an EV factory in Hungary.
     
            The flood of cheaper Chinese vehicles has triggered trade tensions with some countries. In October, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into EV imports from China.
     
            In the United States, the Biden administration announced new regulations in December that aim to keep Chinese batteries out of cars sold in the country. The government is additionally discussing raising tariffs on some Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, in an attempt to bolster the US clean-energy industry against cheaper Chinese products, the Wall Street Journal reported in December, citing anonymous sources.

            Chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is upping its output in Japan as it continues to expand its global presence.
     
            The world’s largest chipmaker will build a second semiconductor fabrication plant, or fab, in the country in “response to rising customer demand,” TSMC said in a statement Tuesday.
     
            Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM), a subsidiary majority-owned by TSMC, plans to start  construction by the end of 2024, it added. The facility is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2027.
     
            Together with JASM’s first plant, which is scheduled to begin operation this year, the overall investment in Japan will exceed $20 billion “with strong support from the Japanese government,” the statement said. Toyota Motor (TM) and Sony (SONY) have also invested in the venture.
     
            The plants will together create about 3,400 skilled jobs, according to TSMC. The increased production in Japan comes at a time when the chip maker is facing delays at its project in Arizona.
     
            The company had announced in 2022 that it would build a second semiconductor plant in the southwestern US state, adding to plans for an existing fab and raising its overall investment in Arizona from $12 billion to $40 billion.
 
            The investment has previously been lauded by US President Joe Biden as a sign that US manufacturing “is back.”
     
            But earlier this year, TSMC said the facility will now be operational only in 2027 or 2028, compared to previous expectations of a 2026 start.
     
            TSMC, based in the Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, produces an estimated 90% of the world’s super-advanced semiconductors and supplies to global tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).
     
            It mass produces components that are vital to the running of everything from smartphones to washing machines.
     
            The company has typically kept its most advanced manufacturing at home in Taiwan, but it has been expanding abroad in recent years due to commercial pressure and encouragement from a number of governments. Last year, it announced a factory in Dresden, Germany, its first in Europe.

            Chinese stocks staged their biggest rally in years Tuesday, after the country’s sovereign wealth fund said it would step up buying shares as officials scramble to draw a line under a three-year market rout.
     
            The Shanghai Composite, mainland China’s benchmark index for large state-owned companies and blue-chip stocks, ended up 3.2% on Tuesday, ending a six-day losing streak. It marks the biggest daily increase since March 2022.
     
            Smaller companies did even better. The Shenzhen Component Index rose 6.2%. It was the index’s best daily gain since September 2015, while startup index ChiNext had its best performance in seven years, soaring 6.7%.
     
            In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index surged 4%, the biggest percentage gain in more than six months. Chinese tech shares led the way. Alibaba Group (BABA), which is due to announce earnings on Wednesday, was up 7.6%.
     
            The positive mood spilled over to Europe, where the region’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index opened about 0.5% higher, before trimming those early gains to stand 0.1% up by 5.44 a.m. ET. US stock futures were mixed.

Angry Chinese take to US Embassy’s social media account to vent about plunging stock market
 
            The rebound in Chinese stocks came after Beijing stepped up its efforts to prop up the ailing stock market, which had a dire 2023 and has been the worst performer in the world so far this year.
     
            By Monday, about $6.1 trillion in market value had been wiped from the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets since their recent peaks in February 2021.
     
            Central Huijin Investment, the equity arm of state-owned China Investment Corp, announced Tuesday that it had recently expanded its holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on mainland stock markets.
     
            “We will continue to increase our holdings and expand our holdings to resolutely maintain the stable operations of the capital market,” it said in a statement.
     
            Shortly after the announcement, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a statement saying it “firmly supports” Central Huijin Investment in its plan to continue to increase the scale of its holdings.
     
            The regulator said it would also encourage more institutional investors, such as mutual funds, state pension funds and insurers, to enter the stock market, the CSRC added.
     
            The intensified efforts came after Chinese markets resumed their slide on Monday, when more than 1,800 stocks fell by more than 10% in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
     
            Angry investors flocked to a social media account of the US Embassy in Beijing to vent their outrage about the meltdown of the stock market, after other outlets of protest had been closed off.

US sends top Treasury officials to China to discuss economy
 
            Tuesday’s rally in China was in contrast to other markets in the region. Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s Kospi closed down 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also lost 0.6%.
     
            The redoubled attempts to rescue Chinese stocks appear to have bought Beijing some more time, but they don’t address the underlying challenges the economy faces — weak demand, deflationary pressures, a crashed real estate sector, and rising trade tensions with the United States.
     
            A brief period of market calm following soothing words from Beijing was brought to an abrupt end late last month when a Hong Kong court ordered Evergrande, the poster child of China’s property crisis, to liquidate. That sent investors running for the exits again.

            A Chinese court has handed a suspended death sentence to Tian Huiyu, an ex-president of China Merchants Bank and previously the right-hand man of the country’s former economic tsar, on charges including bribery and insider trading.
     
            The sentence comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping steps up his anti-corruption purge across the vast financial system, which is aimed at consolidating his control over the “lifeblood” of the economy.
     
            Tian received a death sentence with a two-year reprieve, according to a verdict announced on Monday by the Intermediate People’s Court in Changde city, in central Hunan province. That means the sentence may be commuted to life imprisonment after two years if he does not commit any serious crimes during the two-year period.
     
            Tian was also found guilty of three other charges: abusing his positions in state-owned enterprises, using undisclosed information for stock trading and leaking inside information.
     
            The court said he had used his privileged access to information to make more than 290 million yuan ($41 million) in illegal gains from the stock market. He also leaked inside information about stocks to other people, which yielded more than 8 million yuan ($1.1 million) in illicit profits, it said.
     
            The verdict said Tian had taken advantage of his roles to help individuals and organizations get loans, jobs or businesses. In return, he accepted bribes worth more than 210 million yuan ($30 million), it said.
     
            A veteran banker, Tian had spent more than three decades working in some of China’s largest state-owned financial institutions, including China Construction Bank, the nation’s second largest bank, and China Cinda Asset Management, a major bad debt manager.
     
            In the 1990s, Tian served as the secretary of Wang Qishan, China’s former economic tsar, who was then leading China Construction Bank, according to state-owned newspaper The Beijing News.
     
            In 2013, Tian was promoted to head China Merchants Bank, serving as its president and its Communist Party boss.
     
            In April 2022, he was removed from the top posts at the bank. Days later, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s anti-graft watchdog, announced he was under investigation for “serious violations of discipline and law.”
     
            In October 2022, he was expelled from the party and arrested. He was charged four months later.
     
            Last November, Tian pleaded guilty to the charges at a public court hearing in Changde, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
     
            The Communist Party has stepped up its crackdown on the country’s state-owned financial system since last year. More than a dozen senior executives at the country’s most important financial institutions have been investigated or charged, including Li Xiaopeng, former chairman of China Everbright Group, and Liu Liange, former chairman of Bank of China.
     
            Some prominent figures from the private sector have also been ensnared. Bao Fan, one of the country’s top tech dealmakers, went missing in February 2023. China Renaissance, the investment bank that he had founded and chaired, said he was cooperating with authorities in an investigation.
     
            Bao resurfaced earlier this month, with China Renaissance announcing his resignation from the company due to “health” and family reasons.

            A team of five US Treasury Department officials is traveling to Beijing this week for a series of meetings on the economy with their counterparts in China, a Treasury official told CNN on Monday.
     
            The trip by senior officials comes ahead of a planned return to China by Treasury secretary Janet Yellen later in 2024.
     
            The high-level US delegation will be led by Jay Shambaugh, Treasury’s under secretary for international affairs.
     
            US officials plan to have frank conversations about China’s trade tactics — a thorny subject that has united many in Washington and that former President Donald Trump has vowed to aggressively attack by imposing massive tariffs. Specifically, the Treasury delegation plans to raise China’s use of non-market economic practices and industrial overcapacity, the official said.
     
            In the past, Yellen has called out China for “unfair” practices, including erecting barriers for foreign firms to enter the coveted market and taking “coercive actions” against American firms.
     
            There are also plans for candid talks on economic developments, including risks to the global economy and fiscal and central bank policies, according to Treasury.

Angry Chinese take to US Embassy’s social media account to vent about plunging stock market
 
            The visit marks the first time that the economic working group is meeting in Beijing since it was launched last September after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s trip to China.
     
            The meetings come at a delicate time as China’s financial markets experience their most serious bout of turbulence in years amid concerns about the country’s economic slowdown. The Shanghai Composite plunged 6% last week, its worst since October 2018, prompting countless social media users to post angry comments on the Beijing-based US Embassy Weibo account. Last week, a court in Hong Kong ordered the liquidation of Evergrande, the world’s most indebted property developer.
     
            However, there is nothing to suggest the latest US-China meeting is in direct response to the renewed concerns about China’s economy and financial markets. This is the third such meeting of the economic working group, which has always been expected to meet regularly.
 
            News of the visit to China was previously reported by The New York Times.
     
            Yellen has made repairing ties between the United States and China a central part of her portfolio. In December, Yellen detailed her plans to build on warming relations between the world’s two largest economies, which includes improving communications, pushing Beijing for greater transparency, ramping up regulatory collaboration and tackling issues like terror financing and the flow of fentanyl.
     
            “But for too long, American workers and firms have not been able to compete on a level playing field with those in China,” Yellen said during a speech at the US-China Business Council’s 50th anniversary dinner. “The PRC deploys unfair economic practices, from non-market tools, to barriers to access for foreign firms, to coercive actions against American companies. These policies harm American workers and firms.”
     
            During an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged “challenges” facing China’s economy, including in the real estate market. However, Powell said these troubles may not have a huge impact directly on the United States.
     
            “As long as what happens in China doesn’t lead to significant disruptions in the economy or the financial system,” Powell said, “then the implications for the United States — we may feel them a bit, but they shouldn’t be that large.”

            Tens of thousands of people in China are flocking to an unusual venue to vent their outrage about the continuing meltdown in the country’s stock market.
     
            They’ve been posting comments on a Chinese-language social media account of the US Embassy in Beijing expressing anger and frustration with the market rout.
     
            Mainland Chinese markets slumped again Monday after their worst week in years. More than 1,800 stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, accounting for a third of all stocks listed in China, slumped more than 10%.
     
            A post by the embassy Friday on Weibo about protecting wild giraffes in Africa attracted more than 160,000 comments, many of which were unrelated to animal protection.
     
            “The US government, please help Chinese stock investors,” a user wrote in a repost of the article.
     
            Many posts later appeared to be scrubbed by censors. Chinese authorities have recently stepped up their censorship of criticism about the stalled economy and market chaos.
     
            CNN has reached out to the US Embassy for comment.
     
            On Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped for a sixth straight session, down 1% and hitting its lowest close in four years. Last week, the index fell 6.2% in its biggest weekly loss since October 2018.
     
            The Shenzhen Component Index swung wildly between gains and losses during the trading day, before ending down 1.1%. The index slid 8.1% last week.
     
            Internet users likely chose the US Embassy’s Weibo page to protest because other outlets have been closed off. For example, China’s market regulators have disabled the comments sections of their own social media accounts.
     
            Since late last year, some of China’s most prominent analysts have been subjected to social media restrictions that appear designed to reduce their ability to comment on the country’s economic problems.
     
            To get around the censorship, some social media users resorted over the weekend to euphemisms and jokes.﻿
 
            ”Arise! All giraffes who refuse to be slaves,” one user said in a repost of the US Embassy’s animal story. The phrase draws from the first line of China’s national anthem: “Arise! All who refuse to be slaves!”
     
            “The entire giraffe community is filled with optimism,” another user said, poking fun at an article published Friday by the state-owned People’s Daily newspaper about the visit of a German communist politician under the headline “the whole country is filled with optimism.”
     
            Monday’s market losses suggest investors remain unconvinced by Chinese regulators’ repeated pledges to bolster confidence. On Sunday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission vowed again to prevent “abnormal fluctuations” in the stock market. But it did not offer any details about how it would do so.
     
            “Despite attempts by state authorities to stabilize the market, investor sentiment remains fragile, reflecting deep-seated concerns about the reliability of government policies and the regulatory framework,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.
     
            Further, “the uncertainty surrounding Chinese markets and trade relations is compounded by the possibility of increasing tariffs on China, as proposed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump,” he added.
     
            In an extraordinary message, a listed company appears to be suggesting that Chinese investors take a break from the stock market — if only for a few days over the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.
     
            “Life is not only about the stock market, but also about parents, spouses, children and friends. [We] recommend that investors temporarily leave the stock market, let go of their obsessions, change their mood, and welcome the New Year with a relaxed and peaceful mood,” Hangzhou Yitong New Materials said in a comment posted in response to a question from investors in an online forum run by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
     
            The Shenzhen-listed company, which produces metal products, has lost 42% of its stock market value since the start of this year.
     
            Altogether, about $6.1 trillion in market value has been wiped from the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets since their recent peaks in February 2021, according to a CNN calculation based on data from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges.
     
            A record downturn in its dominant real estate market, high youth unemployment, deflation and a rapidly falling birthrate are just some of the issues ailing the world’s second-largest economy.

            Former President Donald Trump said Sunday he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he regains the presidency. His remarks come at a time of high economic and other tensions between the US and China.
     
            “No, I would say maybe it’s going to be more than that,” Trump said when asked by Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” whether he would consider imposing a 60% tariff, as The Washington Post has reported.
     
            As president, Trump slapped tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods in June 2018. Beijing countered with its own tariffs, and the spiral continued until the two countries arrived at an agreement in 2020. The Biden administration has largely kept the Trump-era tariffs in place.
     
            The former president also said he thought China would try to interfere in the 2024 presidential election.
     
            “I think they will, and they won’t be interfering on my behalf. We should go same-day voting, paper ballots, voter ID and no mail-in ballots,” Trump said.
     
            Chinese leader Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN has reported. But FBI Director Christopher Wray warned Wednesday that Chinese hackers are preparing to “wreak havoc and cause real-world harm” to the US.
     
            Trump also praised Xi, whom he described as “a very good friend of mine during my term,” and said, “I want China to do great, I do.”
     
            Trump would not say whether he would intervene if China tried taking over Taiwan, arguing that doing so would “jeopardize my negotiating ability with China.”
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and leader Xi has not ruled out the use of military force to “reunify” the island with the mainland.
     
            The US, meanwhile, is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself, something Beijing regards as interference in its internal affairs.

            Chinese stocks have had a very bad week.
     
            Despite recent attempts by Beijing to shore up confidence in the economy and stem a protracted stock market slump that has wiped out $6 trillion in value in three years, investors are still rushing for the exit.
     
            The Shanghai Composite index fell 6.2%, its biggest weekly loss since October 2018, while the Shenzhen Component index shed 8.1%, its largest drop in three years. The indexes have lost more than 8% and 15% respectively since the start of the year.
     
            China’s blue-chip CSI 300 index, comprising 300 major stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, also fell 4.6%, notching its worst week since October 2022. The index is down 7% year-to-date.
     
            A record downturn in its dominant real estate market, high youth unemployment, deflation, and a rapidly falling birthrate are just some of the issues ailing the world’s second-largest economy.
     
            The International Monetary Fund expects annual growth in China’s gross domestic product to slow to 4.6% this year — from 5.2% in 2023, one of the weakest performances in decades — and to decline further to about 3.5% in 2028.
     
            The week started with a Hong Kong court ordering the liquidation of Evergrande, the world’s most indebted property developer and poster child for the real estate crisis.
     
            But far from providing closure, the order — the first by a Hong Court regarding the winding up of such a large Chinese company — raised a host of questions about the future of the sprawling business and other insolvent developers.
     
            Last week, the People’s Bank of China and Chinese government announced that they would expand access to commercial bank loans for property developers.
     
            “These policies indicate that healthier developers can therefore expect increased funding this year, while those struggling to clear their debts will likely go the way of Evergrande,” said Diana Choyleva, chief economist for Enodo Economics.

            The move was the latest in a series of initiatives to try to boost confidence, which include vows to further open up China’s $64 trillion financial industry to foreign investors and to take share price moves into account when evaluating the performance heads of state-owned companies.
     
            The new measures briefly restored a degree of calm among investors last week, but they are still clearly worried about the trajectory of China’s economy.
     
            “There seems to be no policy guidance or initiatives so far on how to ‘promote growth,’” wrote analysts at Bank of America in a note Thursday.
     
            The analysts said the Chinese investors they had spoken to were concerned about the long-term outlook for the economy, and had “low expectations” for government stimulus measures.
     
            China’s problems stand in stark contrast to the fortunes of its neighbor, India, whose benchmark Sensex index, tracking 30 large companies, and broader Nifty 50 index, have soared to a series of record highs in recent months.
     
            The surge in India’s stocks reflects the potential of its fast-growing economy. The International Monetary Fund has projected India’s gross domestic product to grow by 6.5% in 2024 and 2025, far outpacing other major world economies.

            Did China just pull ahead of Japan to become the world’s top car exporter? Beijing clearly thinks so, but Tokyo isn’t quite ready to concede its long-held crown.
     
            “It is a certainty that China has become the world’s largest exporter,” the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said last month.
     
            But the answer isn’t that clear-cut and depends on which set of data you use.
     
            According to Japan’s most recent customs data, the country exported 5.97 million vehicles in 2023. That was more than the 5.22 million passenger cars, buses and trucks China sold overseas last year, according to Chinese customs, a number that chimes with CPCA data.
     
            And the picture is further clouded if you consider industry association data. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association released figures on Wednesday indicating the country shipped 4.42 million vehicles to the rest of the world in 2023, less than the 4.91 million exports the China Auto Manufacturing Association reported.
     
            In both countries, customs and industry associations use different metrics. Customs data usually include more categories of cars and car-parts, so their numbers are bigger than the industry figures.
     
            One trend is clear though: China has been closing the gap with the world’s top car exporting nations over the past two years. Its shipments surpassed those of South Korea in 2021 and Germany in 2022.
     
            Its momentum was driven by strong demand in Russia and growing global appetite for electric vehicles (EVs).
     
            Chinese carmakers have benefited from an exodus of global brands from Russia and the imposition of sanctions imposed since Moscow ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
     
            2023 was also a banner year for Chinese EVs, which are cheaper than models built by rivals elsewhere. They have made inroads in Europe, Australia and Southeast Asia.
     
            In 2023, China’s passenger car exports rose 62% from 2022, according to data published by the CPCA last month. More than a quarter of them were electric.
     
            Chinese carmakers are increasingly expanding overseas, particularly as the domestic economy lost momentum last year.
     
BYD, the Shenzhen-based manufacturer, overtook Tesla (TSLA) as the world’s top seller of EVs at the end of last year, crowning an extraordinary rise for the Chinese carmaker.
     
            It delivered more fully electric cars than Tesla for the first time in the three-month period to December 31, and slashed the sales lead held by Elon Musk’s company over the year as a whole.

            Bao Fan, a star Chinese tech banker who disappeared a year ago amid Beijing’s anti-corruption crackdown, has formally resigned from the firm he founded, the company said.
     
            China Renaissance announced in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Friday that Bao was stepping down as its chairman and CEO, effectively immediately, for “health reasons and to spend more time on his family affairs.”
     
            “There is no other matter relating to his resignation that needs to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the Company,” the Hong Kong-listed firm added.
     
            It did not provide further details on Bao’s status or whether anyone had been in touch with him. In April, the company said it was forced to delay the release of its annual results, because its auditors were unable to reach Bao.
     
            CNN has contacted China Renaissance for comment.
     
            Last summer, the Economic Observer, a state-run financial publication, reported that Bao had been in the custody of the country’s top anti-graft watchdog since his disappearance in February 2023. He was said to be involved in an investigation into suspected corporate bribery, the report said.
     
            China Renaissance announced a management reshuffle to replace its chairman and CEO, along with other top positions. Among the changes, Xie Yi Jing, co-founder of the company, will succeed Bao as its new chairman. He has also been “redesignated” from acting CEO to CEO of the company, the filing said.
     
            Bao was a veteran banker in China’s tech industry. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 in Beijing and made it one of the top dealmakers for Chinese tech firms. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.
     
            The banker’s disappearance sent a chill through China’s financial markets and its tech sector. The company later said Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” by certain authorities in China, without giving further details.
     
            Bao’s disappearance coincided with a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown launched by the ruling Communist Party into the financial sector, which has ensnared more than a dozen senior executives at China’s biggest financial institutions.
     
            Shares in China Renaissance were suspended from trading last April because of issues related to Bao’s status.
     
            Last month, China Renaissance said it had appointed a new auditor following the resignation of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and would try to publish the 2022 annual results and 2023 interim report “as soon as practicable.”
     
            The release of the company’s financial results is a key requirement for its shares to resume trading, according to rules of the Hong Kong stock exchange.

            China has executed a couple for throwing two toddlers out of a high-rise apartment window, in a case that provoked nationwide outrage.
     
            The man and his girlfriend were found guilty of killing the children from his first marriage by staging an accidental fall from a residential tower in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, so that they could start a new family.
     
            The father, Zhang Bo, began an affair with Ye Chengchen and initially hid the fact that he was married with children, but Ye found out and Zhang divorced his wife, according to China’s supreme court.
     
            Ye saw Zhang’s two children as an “obstacle” to them getting married and a “burden on their future life together,” the court heard.  She repeatedly urged Zhang to kill the toddlers and threatened to break up with him if he didn’t.
     
            After conspiring with Ye, in November 2020, Zhang threw his two-year-old daughter and one-year-old son from his 15th floor apartment when they were playing next to the bedroom window, killing them both, according to the court.
     
            Zhang and Ye were sentenced to death in December 2021.
     
            The Supreme People’s Court said the couple’s crime “seriously challenged the legal and moral bottom line,” calling their criminal motive “extremely despicable” and means “particularly cruel,” state news agency Xinhua reported.
     
            News of their execution drew hundreds of millions of views on Chinese social media site Weibo, where it became a top trending topic.
     
            “They deserved the punishment,” said a top comment with 27,000 likes.
     
            “How very satisfying!” said another with 31,000 likes.
     
            A study published in 2020 shows 68% of Chinese citizens are in favor of death penalty.
     
            But John Zhuang Liu, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who authored the paper, told CNN Thursday that online views might not accurately reflect China’s public opinion.
     
            His study shows that Chinese people who express political views online tend to show greater support for the death penalty.
     
            “We do not have a clear understanding of the general public’s views on the death penalty in China, and we lack a rigorous data collection channel,” he said.
     
            The 2020 paper was based on the last available nationwide data collected in 2013.
     
            “We don’t know whether public views have shifted since then,” he said.
     
            China does not provide transparent information on the total number of executions, but the country is believed to be “the world’s top executioner” with thousands of people executed and sentenced to death each year, according to human rights group Amnesty International.
     
            Wednesday’s execution also brought into focus the main method used in China to carry out the death penalty: lethal injection.
     
            “It’s basically euthanasia. They had it easy,” said a comment on Weibo with 20,000 likes.
     
            Some drew attention to the recent execution of Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith by nitrogen gas, a new method that experts have said could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
     
            The execution was hailed by some Chinese social media users as a punishment that fits  more serious crimes.

            Heavy snow and rain is forecast to hit central and eastern China in the coming days, threatening travel plans for hundreds of millions of Chinese workers heading home for the Lunar New Year.
     
            Also known as the Spring Festival, the Lunar New Year holiday traditionally sees the nation pause as migrant workers pile onto trains, planes and buses to go home to see their family.
     
            Forecasters warn the extreme winter weather could cause mass disruption, with state broadcaster CCTV predicting the “most complex weather” since early 2008, when heavy snow affected more than 67 million people.
     
            However, Xu Jun, chief forecaster from the Central Meteorological Observatory, told CCTV the forecast snowfall won’t be as heavy or widespread as that experienced around the holiday season 16 years ago.
     
            “Its extreme nature comes from the fact that it is a rare weather event with great intensity and impacts,” she said.
     
            At least 10 provinces - including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Liaoning and Hubei - are anticipating blizzards until the start of next week, just days before the Lunar New Year begins next Saturday, CCTV said, citing China’s Central Meteorological Observatory.
     
            “The rain and snow overlap with the peak period of Spring Festival travel. This has posed risks to safe (travel) and brought inconvenience to the transportation,” weather expert Wang Lijuan, from China Meteorological Administration, told CCTV.
     
            The Central Meteorological Observatory has already issued a blizzard warning for some of the affected region, with snow running up to 5 centimeters (nearly 2 inches) thick in some areas, according to its Chinese social media account.
     
            In Zhengzhou, a central eastern city, authorities canceled some high-speed train services and said they would order trains to operate at reduced speed due to the blizzards and rain.
     
            At least five provinces - including Henan, Hubei and Anhui - will be hit by freezing rain, CCTV reported, which is likely to further complicate travels.
     
            The weather phenomenon refers to raindrops being frozen into ice droplets upon contact with surfaces after they hit the ground, which could damage electricity cables and make roads slippery, China Meteorological Administration warned in a Weibo post, urging drivers to slow down.
     
            Xu, from the Central Meteorological Observatory, told CCTV freezing rain could affect many provinces over an area as wide as 43,000 square kilometers (16,600 square miles).
     
            Blizzards struck many parts of China in early 2008, damaging power lines and blocking highways and railways, leaving hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded.
     
            At least 24 people died while 827,000 people were evacuated in 14  provinces.
     
            China, like many other parts of the world, has been hit by extreme weather in recent years.
     
            Its lowest ever temperature was recorded last January, when Jintao town in Mohe, northeastern Heilongjiang province, dropped to -53° C.
     
            Last summer, China recorded its hottest year on record and was also hit by the heaviest rainfall in decades, causing flooding and billions of dollars in damage.

            FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday warned that Chinese hackers are preparing to “wreak havoc and cause real-world harm” to the US.
     
            “China’s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike,” Wray told the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
     
            Though cyber officials have long sounded the alarm about China’s offensive cyber capabilities, Wray’s dramatic public warning underlines the huge level of concern at the top of the US government about the threat Chinese hackers pose to critical infrastructure nationwide. The head of the National Security Agency and other senior US officials also testified on Chinese cyber activity in front of the panel Wednesday.

            Chinese government-backed hackers, Wray said, are targeting things like water treatment plants, electrical infrastructure and oil and natural gas pipelines.
     
            The Chinese hackers are working “to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous,” Wray said. “And let’s be clear: Cyber threats to our critical infrastructure represent real world threats to our physical safety.”
     
            The Chinese government has previously denied allegations of hacking efforts.
     
            The hearing comes in the wake of a big push by US and Chinese officials to ease tensions in the relationship between the two superpowers. At a meeting in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US election, CNN exclusively reported on Tuesday. That assurance was reiterated by the Chinese foreign minister to Biden’s national security adviser this past weekend, sources told CNN. US officials will be closely watching to see if Xi keeps his word.
     
            Asked about that assurance at the House hearing, Wray said: “China’s promised a lot of things over the years, so I’ll guess I’ll believe it when I see it.”
     
            The focus of the hearing was not US elections but how Chinese hackers are allegedly burrowing in computer networks at ports, energy plants and other key infrastructure in the US.
     
            “The truth is the Chinese cyber actors have taken advantage of very basic flaws in our technology. We have made it easy on them,” Jen Easterly, who leads the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told lawmakers.
     
            “Unfortunately, the technology underpinning our critical infrastructure is inherently insecure because of decades of software developers not being held liable for defective technology. That has led to incentives where features and speed to market have been prioritized against security, leading our nation vulnerable to cyber invasion. That has to stop,” Easterly said.
     
            The FBI and Justice Department have previously stressed their focus on preventing malign campaigns by the Chinese government and hackers.
     
            CNN has reported that in recent months, federal law enforcement has used a court order to allow the Justice Department to remove malicious code from, or otherwise protect hundreds of devices in the US that are at the center of the Chinese hacking campaign targeting sensitive US critical infrastructure. Nevertheless, the hackers are believed to be deeply entrenched in US infrastructure.
     
            The move by the Justice Department and FBI is part of a broader, government-wide attempt to blunt the impact of a persistent Chinese hacking effort that US officials fear could hinder any US military response in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, CNN has reported. The hackers are believed to be using access to some of the devices to burrow further into sensitive critical infrastructure — things like ports and transportation networks.
     
            Part of the problem facing US officials is a sheer numbers game. Wray reiterated Wednesday that he believes that China’s cyber operatives outnumber all FBI agents by at least 50 to 1.
     
            And Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency, told lawmakers that kicking the hackers out of US critical networks is an ongoing concern.
     
            “We need to have a vigilance that continues onward,” Nakasone said. “This is not an episodic threat that we’re going to face. This is persistent.”
     
            Wray said Wednesday that China’s efforts extend beyond technology, warning that “they target our freedoms, reaching inside our borders, across America, to silence, coerce, and threaten our citizens and residents.”

            The FBI and Justice Department have used a court order to address vulnerabilities in thousands of internet-connected devices that are at the center of a Chinese hacking campaign targeting sensitive US critical infrastructure, two US officials and a third source familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            The move is part of a broader, government-wide effort to blunt the impact of a persistent Chinese hacking effort that US officials fear could hinder any US military response in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the source familiar said. The hackers are believed to be using access to some of the devices to burrow further into sensitive critical infrastructure — things like ports and transportation networks.
     
            The court order allows the Justice Department to update vulnerable software used by thousands of devices in the US that are vulnerable to the Chinese hacking, the source said.
     
            In announcing the operation on Wednesday, the Justice Department said that it had removed malicious code from “hundreds” of internet routers nationwide.
     
            The Justice Department action is an effort to undercut the Chinese hackers’ ability to communicate with some of the infrastructure used in the hacks. But the hackers are believed to be deeply entrenched in US infrastructure. “We will need to keep doing it,” the source familiar told CNN. The White House has in recent months held a series of meetings with tech firms like internet and cloud computing providers to try to better track the Chinese hackers’ activity, the source said.
     
            Reuters first reported on the US law enforcement activity.
     
            In revealing the alleged Chinese hacking campaign last year, Microsoft, whose customers were targeted, said the hackers targeted critical infrastructure in Guam, a US territory that is key to US efforts to counter and deter China’s territorial ambitions in the Pacific. The US Marine Corps last year chose Guam as the place to open its first new base in 70 years, a facility that officials expect to host 5,000 Marines.
     
            The intrusion of the Chinese hackers into US maritime and transportation networks have alarmed senior national security officials, who believe the hackers are there not to collect intelligence but to potentially cripple computer networks in the event of a US-China conflict. Rob Joyce, a senior National Security Agency official, has told CNN that the Chinese activity is “unacceptable” because of its potential disruptive effects.
     
            “I think the difference here is how brazen it is in scope and scale,” Joyce told CNN last May.
     
            The Chinese government has denied the allegations.
     
            The heads of the FBI, NSA and other senior US officials testified Wednesday on the Chinese cyber activity before the House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party.

Taiwan has protested against China’s “unilateral” adjustment of civil aviation flight routes that could result in civilian aircraft flying closer to the sensitive Taiwan Strait median line, adding pressure on Taipei in its aviation safety and aerial defense.
     
            China’s Civil Aviation Administration said it in a statement Tuesday it will cancel a “veer-off measure” for all southbound flights operating on the M503 flight route, which lies just west of the median line – an informal demarcation point that Beijing does not recognize but until recently largely respected – and within the Shanghai Flight Information Region.
     
            This means all southbound flights will no longer need to veer off six nautical miles to the west from the designated route – as agreed by Beijing and Taipei in 2015 – and can now fly on the original path, bringing the aircraft closer to the median line and the Taipei Flight Information Region.
     
            The statement also said China will start operating on two ancillary routes connecting M503 with the cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen in Fujian province, which Taipei says could impact safety for its civilian aircraft flying in and out of Matsu and Kinmen, two outlying Taipei-controlled islands close to the shores of China.

            In response, Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration says it “deeply regrets and firmly protests” China’s decision, while the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan’s China policymaking agency, calls the attempt “a blatant neglect of aviation safety and a show of disrespect for Taiwan.”
     
            China’s move “deliberately masks its ill political and possibly military motive against Taiwan in the name of civil aviation that could alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,” the MAC said.
     
            China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its territory despite never having controlled it, and has spent decades trying to isolate it diplomatically.
     
            In 2015, China unilaterally declared the operation of M503 route, prompting protests from Taipei. After negotiations with Taipei, Beijing agreed at the time to move the route six nautical miles to the west of its original path.
     
            The median line dividing China and Taiwan has been a tacit understanding between both sides not bound by any legal pact. Beijing has never formally recognized the existence of such a line, and in recent years has sent military jets across the line on a near daily basis, as it ramps up military pressure on the self-ruled island.
