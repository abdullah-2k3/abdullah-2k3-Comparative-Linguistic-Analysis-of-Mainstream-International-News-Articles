US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, centre left, chats with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, centre, during a group photograph session after their meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, June 3, 2018. US and Chinese negotiators start two days of high-level talks Wednesday aimed at settling a six-month trade war that has weakened both sides, shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy. Yet the odds seem stacked against any substantive resolution this week to the standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Perhaps the best that might be hoped for, analysts say, is for the two sides to agree to keep talking. The differences between Beijing and Washington are vast. The United States is essentially demanding that China downsize its economic aspiration to become a supreme world leader in such fields as robotics and electric cars. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Alibaba's CEO, Daniel Zhang noted that China has more than one billion consumers, and he maintains that as long as conditions are right, it can be a self-sufficient market."" The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December. TRT World's
Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

Data announced Monday showed economic growth cooled to a post-global crisis quarterly low of 6.4 percent in the three months ending in December from the previous quarter's 6.5 percent. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Beijing. Chinese economic growth has been slowing since regulators tightened controls on bank lending in late 2017 to rein in a debt boom. Growth held up through much of 2018 despite President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese goods in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions. But exports contracted in December as the penalties began to dampen demand. Growth in investment, retail sales and other indicators also slowed."

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

China urges the United States to prudently and properly handle the Taiwan-related issues, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Thursday. Geng made the comments in response to the passage by two US warships through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday. He said China has closely monitored the passage from start to end and expressed its concerns to the US  side. ""The Taiwan issue concerns the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and is the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations,"" Geng said.   ""We urge the US  side to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiques, prudently and properly handling Taiwan-related issues so as not to harm China-US relations as well as the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" he added.  ""Self-ruled island"" The voyage risks further heightening tensions with China, which considers Taiwan its own and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement late on Thursday the ships were moving in a northerly direction and that their voyage was in accordance with regulations. It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

Yao Jing, China’s ambassador in Islamabad, also praised Pakistan’s role in facilitating the Afghan peace process -- including its efforts to facilitate talks between the Taliban and US  -- and helping end the long conflict in Afghanistan. ""China will pick Taliban as a political force because they are now part of the Afghan political process and they have some political concerns,"" the Dawn quoted Yao telling a gathering in the northwestern city of Peshawar.

Chances for resumption of the stalled process dimmed further following the death of Omer’s successor, Mullah Mansur, in a US drone strike in 2016 on Pakistan, near the Afghan border. Since then, several attempts to resume the stalled peace process have been made by a four-nation group made up of Pakistan, Afghanistan, the US, and China"

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest. (Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

US and Chinese negotiators start two days of high-level talks Wednesday aimed at settling a six-month trade war that has weakened both sides, shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy. Yet the odds seem stacked against any substantive resolution this week to the standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Perhaps the best that might be hoped for, analysts say, is for the two sides to agree to keep talking. The differences between Beijing and Washington are vast. The United States is essentially demanding that China downsize its economic aspiration to become a supreme world leader in such fields as robotics and electric cars.

Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest. (Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive.

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-un firm backing in deadlocked nuclear talks with the United States, insisting the two sides should meet ""halfway"", Chinese state media said on Thursday. Kim visited Beijing this week for two days of talks that reasserted China's role in the process, and were seen as a strategy session ahead of an expected second summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump. At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

No details were immediately announced, but Asian stock markets rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

A banner is reflected on a polished surface as China's President Xi Jinping (C) speaks during an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 2, 2019. Taiwan's unification with the mainland is ""inevitable"", President Xi Jinping said on January 2, warning against any effort to promote the island's independence and saying China would not renounce the option of military force to bring it into the fold. With détente seeming to settle upon the Korean peninsula, East Asia’s most dangerous flashpoint may now be Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping is morphing into a better dressed version of Mao Zedong and reviving Mao-style policies throughout the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and beyond. One of his targets, the subject of his New Year’s address, is Taiwan. Up until January 1, forty years ago, there were two Chinas. At least, until then the US formally recognised the Republic of China, located on the island of Taiwan, which claimed to be the legitimate government of all China. No one really believed that, and Washington had begun talking with Beijing in 1972. After that countries accelerated their shift in recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The mainland’s diplomatic advantage grew along with its economy. Today just 16 small, mostly African and Latin American nations, recognise the ROC, which has been denied independent status in international organisations as well. However, even that does not satisfy the Xi government, which wants “reunification”. The island has been out of the mainland’s control for more than 120 years, other than a brief period after World War II. On New Year’s Day, Xi gave a major speech addressing Taiwan, expressing his government’s willingness “to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”. However, he warned: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures [to achieve Beijing’s ends].” Which sounds like American presidents who proclaim that “all options are the table,” code words threatening war. Xi sought to paint a positive picture of Chinese control: “Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.” Alas, he offered no guarantees to preserve Taiwan’s free society and democratic system. Nor would any such promises be believable. Xi’s turn toward totalitarianism, including the incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in reeducation camps, creates a fearsome prospect for a united future. While he cited Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework as the model, Beijing has steadily tightened its control over that territory, despite pledging to preserve British-style liberties. Even before Xi’s reincarnation as Mao, the Taiwanese people turned decisively against “reunification” with China. A vanishingly small proportion of the young identify with the mainland. Their connection with the PRC is minimal; Taiwan is their home. And they have no reason to voluntarily choose what amounts to a foreign dictatorship, which during its worst times proved to be one of the bloodiest tyrannies in human history. But even if the mainland were democratic, why would the Taiwanese want to be submerged in the neighbouring colossus? Take away the idea of defence against foreign invaders, and the only country threatening to attack Taiwan is the PRC, there is no reason for the former to become just another brick in a Chinese imperial wall. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen spoke a day before Xi, insisting that his government respect Taiwanese liberty and democracy. Her party did badly in the recent elections, but that did not reflect a pro-Beijing surge, rather, domestic issues dominated. Taiwan’s people recognise that a declaration of independence would risk war, so most support today’s ambiguous status. If the Chinese leadership was equally accommodating, the situation would be stable. But Xi, especially, appears determined to force a decision, which risks war and would significantly affect the rest of the region. Although the PRC’s military strength greatly exceeds that of Taiwan, an invasion would be difficult. Washington has, at best, an ambiguous military commitment to Taiwan; the president would not want war with the PRC, but would also be loath to walk away from an ally of more than seven decades. Economic sanctions, at least, would be inevitable; even Europe would likely respond to an attack on the island. Any victory by Beijing would be dearly bought. Instead, all the players need to find a compromise. For instance, while continuing to claim full sovereignty over Taiwan, the PRC should affirm its commitment to peace and withdraw some of its missiles targeted on the island. While preparing to defend itself if necessary, Taipei should eschew policies that highlight its independent existence internationally. While the US should continue selling Taiwan weapons to deter attack, the former should pledge to neither seek bases on the island nor intervene in any conflict which might erupt between Beijing and Taipei. The world is very different to 40 years ago. Unfortunately, the possibility of war over Taiwan is significantly greater today. Any military confrontation would be a disaster to all concerned. Perhaps the best China, Taiwan, and America can do is peacefully kick the controversy down the road — again."

According to the paper, the officials staying at the houses, ""share their bread, celebrate holidays together, help the children with homework, develop friendships, encourage the feeling of 'National Unity and Family' and take families to Urumqi, the capital of the region for activities."" It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits. Among the civil servants staying in the homes of Uighur families, it was reported that there were public officials from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region armed forces, the Armed Police Units and the Chinese central government's representatives.

Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

US and Chinese negotiators start two days of high-level talks Wednesday aimed at settling a six-month trade war that has weakened both sides, shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy. Yet the odds seem stacked against any substantive resolution this week to the standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Perhaps the best that might be hoped for, analysts say, is for the two sides to agree to keep talking. The differences between Beijing and Washington are vast. The United States is essentially demanding that China downsize its economic aspiration to become a supreme world leader in such fields as robotics and electric cars. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Alibaba's CEO, Daniel Zhang noted that China has more than one billion consumers, and he maintains that as long as conditions are right, it can be a self-sufficient market."" The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December. TRT World's
Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement late on Thursday the ships were moving in a northerly direction and that their voyage was in accordance with regulations. It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence.

The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest. (Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-un firm backing in deadlocked nuclear talks with the United States, insisting the two sides should meet ""halfway"", Chinese state media said on Thursday. Kim visited Beijing this week for two days of talks that reasserted China's role in the process, and were seen as a strategy session ahead of an expected second summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump. At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

No details were immediately announced, but Asian stock markets rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday on an unannounced visit for talks with President Xi Jinping, as preparations ramp up for an expected second summit with Donald Trump. South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. A motorcade was seen leaving a Beijing train station, with police blocking a street with metal gates hours after Kim's train crossed the border into northern China, according to AFP journalists. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Hong Kong for more. Last year, Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the US and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that US State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The US State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. ""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. ""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."" At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea's foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks."""

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

A banner is reflected on a polished surface as China's President Xi Jinping (C) speaks during an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 2, 2019. Taiwan's unification with the mainland is ""inevitable"", President Xi Jinping said on January 2, warning against any effort to promote the island's independence and saying China would not renounce the option of military force to bring it into the fold. With détente seeming to settle upon the Korean peninsula, East Asia’s most dangerous flashpoint may now be Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping is morphing into a better dressed version of Mao Zedong and reviving Mao-style policies throughout the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and beyond. One of his targets, the subject of his New Year’s address, is Taiwan. Up until January 1, forty years ago, there were two Chinas. At least, until then the US formally recognised the Republic of China, located on the island of Taiwan, which claimed to be the legitimate government of all China. No one really believed that, and Washington had begun talking with Beijing in 1972. After that countries accelerated their shift in recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The mainland’s diplomatic advantage grew along with its economy. Today just 16 small, mostly African and Latin American nations, recognise the ROC, which has been denied independent status in international organisations as well. However, even that does not satisfy the Xi government, which wants “reunification”. The island has been out of the mainland’s control for more than 120 years, other than a brief period after World War II. On New Year’s Day, Xi gave a major speech addressing Taiwan, expressing his government’s willingness “to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”. However, he warned: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures [to achieve Beijing’s ends].” Which sounds like American presidents who proclaim that “all options are the table,” code words threatening war. Xi sought to paint a positive picture of Chinese control: “Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.” Alas, he offered no guarantees to preserve Taiwan’s free society and democratic system. Nor would any such promises be believable. Xi’s turn toward totalitarianism, including the incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in reeducation camps, creates a fearsome prospect for a united future. While he cited Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework as the model, Beijing has steadily tightened its control over that territory, despite pledging to preserve British-style liberties. Even before Xi’s reincarnation as Mao, the Taiwanese people turned decisively against “reunification” with China. A vanishingly small proportion of the young identify with the mainland. Their connection with the PRC is minimal; Taiwan is their home. And they have no reason to voluntarily choose what amounts to a foreign dictatorship, which during its worst times proved to be one of the bloodiest tyrannies in human history. But even if the mainland were democratic, why would the Taiwanese want to be submerged in the neighbouring colossus? Take away the idea of defence against foreign invaders, and the only country threatening to attack Taiwan is the PRC, there is no reason for the former to become just another brick in a Chinese imperial wall. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen spoke a day before Xi, insisting that his government respect Taiwanese liberty and democracy. Her party did badly in the recent elections, but that did not reflect a pro-Beijing surge, rather, domestic issues dominated. Taiwan’s people recognise that a declaration of independence would risk war, so most support today’s ambiguous status. If the Chinese leadership was equally accommodating, the situation would be stable. But Xi, especially, appears determined to force a decision, which risks war and would significantly affect the rest of the region. Although the PRC’s military strength greatly exceeds that of Taiwan, an invasion would be difficult. Washington has, at best, an ambiguous military commitment to Taiwan; the president would not want war with the PRC, but would also be loath to walk away from an ally of more than seven decades. Economic sanctions, at least, would be inevitable; even Europe would likely respond to an attack on the island. Any victory by Beijing would be dearly bought. Instead, all the players need to find a compromise. For instance, while continuing to claim full sovereignty over Taiwan, the PRC should affirm its commitment to peace and withdraw some of its missiles targeted on the island. While preparing to defend itself if necessary, Taipei should eschew policies that highlight its independent existence internationally. While the US should continue selling Taiwan weapons to deter attack, the former should pledge to neither seek bases on the island nor intervene in any conflict which might erupt between Beijing and Taipei. The world is very different to 40 years ago. Unfortunately, the possibility of war over Taiwan is significantly greater today. Any military confrontation would be a disaster to all concerned. Perhaps the best China, Taiwan, and America can do is peacefully kick the controversy down the road — again."

Uighur boy is seen flying a kite in this file photo. The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper reported earlier this week that in the country's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region 1,120,000 civil servants were staying as guests at 1, 690,000 households, most of which are Muslim Uighurs. According to the paper, the officials staying at the houses, ""share their bread, celebrate holidays together, help the children with homework, develop friendships, encourage the feeling of 'National Unity and Family' and take families to Urumqi, the capital of the region for activities."" It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits. Among the civil servants staying in the homes of Uighur families, it was reported that there were public officials from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region armed forces, the Armed Police Units and the Chinese central government's representatives. The report also suggested that last year in Xinjiang, encouraged by the officials of the ""National Union and Family"" activities deepened the national unity, strengthening the links between the party officials and the local people, ""the CCP's voice was heard by thousands of families,"" the report added. An official speaking to the paper said, ""The villagers are eagerly looking forward to a modern lifestyle and understanding the good policies of the party. Nowadays, the relationship between the party and the people is rapidly developing. The villagers are ... embracing the modern civilization movement. Their lifestyle has changed and so has their thoughts."" Uighur representatives living outside of China have reacted harshly to the practice, saying officials staying at the houses on behalf of the communist party are actually there to spy on the families. Responding to the allegations, China has strongly refuted any suggestion that it is mistreating the Uighur minority. Previously, Hu Lianhe, a spokesman for China's United Front Work Department, had told a UN panel. ""There is no arbitrary detention or lack of freedom of religion and belief."" ""Xinjiang citizens including the Uighurs enjoy equal freedoms and rights."" Hu said, ""there is no such thing as re-education centres,"" but added criminals convicted of ""minor offences"" have been assigned to ""vocational educational and employment training centres with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation."" ""They are not subject to any arbitrary detention or ill-treatment there,"" Hu added."

People demonstrate against China in front of the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland, on November 6, 2018. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman slammed Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, saying it is a ""great embarrassment"" in a written statement on Sunday. Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.  The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a Chinese state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.  ""China, show us their videos if they are alive!"" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter.  He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.  No camps China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated one million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. The country has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and UN rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who live predominantly in a region claimed by Uighurs in China, which they call East Turkistan and is home to some 10 million people, most of whom are Muslim. Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centres where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education.  Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism. Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity.""  Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the ""concentration camps"" and ""systematic assimilation"" to which Muslims in Xinjiang are subject. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement ""a very bad mistake."" Heyit under investigation Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an ""absurd lie.""  She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security. The video shows Heyit in a grey sweater against a nondescript, grey wall. He states his name and gives the date as February 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused. The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed. Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive. The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result, many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media.  On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings. If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

US President Donald Trump, left, gestures as he and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida in this file photo. (April 7, 2017) As leaders of the world's top economic powers seek to defuse tension over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, they will search for common ground on reforms to end a crisis at the institution that was created to prevent economic disputes escalating into war. The World Trade Organization is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional, just when it is most needed to fulfil its role as umpire in trade disputes and as the watchdog of global commerce. ""If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said last week. ""The WTO is doing all it can to support efforts to de-escalate the situation, but finding solutions will require political will and it will require leadership from the G20."" Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing on the effects the US-China trade war has on Chinese exporters.  The WTO has fallen victim to Trump's trade war on economic rival China and the United States has put pressure on the WTO itself to reform. Trump is unhappy with the WTO's failure to hold Beijing to account for failing to open its economy as envisioned when China joined the WTO in 2001. To force reform at the WTO, Trump's team has blocked new appointments to the world's top trade court, the WTO's Appellate Body which is now rapidly running out of judges, meaning it will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. If there are not enough judges, ""disputes go into limbo,"" former Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman said. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States earlier this year. Those, and his tariffs on Chinese imports, have drawn retaliatory tariffs, and represent the kind of dispute the WTO was created to help resolve. Numerous countries have filed litigation at the WTO to contest the tariffs. But if the WTO is unable to rule on them, Trump's aggressive policies cannot be deemed to be illegal and could continue with impunity. The US government has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to force concessions that would change the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. Chinese and US officials negotiating easing the trade tensions were making progress on Friday at a Group of 20 summit in Argentina, a Chinese official said. Court with no judges The US metals tariffs have caused a storm because they are based on what Washington says are national security concerns, which makes them exempt from WTO rules. But other countries dispute the link to national security, and are challenging it at the WTO. They fear Trump could use the same reasoning to put import tariffs on cars and other goods. Time is running out because the Appellate Body now has the minimum three members it needs to function and from December 2019 it will be down to one, so only appeals that get underway by that date have a prospect of being resolved. There is a big backlog of cases going through the WTO dispute settlement process, so the metals tariffs are unlikely to be ruled on and appealed within that time frame. ""The new cases of the US duties on steel and aluminium will not be decided... they will not finish before (the end of) 2019,"" former Appellate Body member Giorgio Sacerdoti said. Another major dispute at the WTO concerns the refusal by the European Union and the United States to recognise China as a ""market economy"" whose goods are fairly priced by the market. They say the Chinese state's involvement in the economy has created a steel and aluminium supply glut. China is pursuing legal action against the EU. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said a ruling in China's favour ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO"". That case is also bogged down. Even if the appeal lands in time, there is another potential hitch. The Appellate Body's Chinese member, Hong Zhao, may have to recuse herself because of a potential conflict of interest, which would make it impossible to decide on any appeal in the case, several trade experts told Reuters. ""It’s a very difficult situation for her,"" one diplomat said. Chinese, US, EU and WTO officials declined to comment on whether or not Zhao would need to be recused."

People walk under an electronic board showing stock information at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Lujiazui Financial Area before the visit of Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in Shanghai, China, September 22, 2015 Chinese shares, commodities and the yuan currency jumped on Monday after Chinese and US leaders agreed to a temporary truce in their bitter trade war, but the longer-term outlook for trade relations remains murky. The deal between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping postponed the most pressing threat to the global and Chinese economies - a sharp hike in US tariffs that had been slated for January 1. But analysts cautioned it has only bought a bit more time for wrangling over deeply divisive trade and policy differences, and said China's economy will continue to cool regardless under the weight of weakening domestic demand. Still, the news offered some relief for the country's battered stock markets, which had tumbled over 20 percent at one point this year, prompting a flurry of support measures. At the midday break, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index was 2.9 percent higher and blue-chip shares surged 3.1 percent. Government bond futures fell as shares rallied, with the 10-year treasury futures for March delivery, the most-traded contract, falling 0.26 percent at the open. It was last down 0.07 percent at 96.630. Shares in Hong Kong also jumped, with the Hang Seng index adding 2.7 percent at midday, and breaking through the 27,000 level for the first time since October 4. The China Enterprises Index is 2.8 percent higher at midday. ""This is a relief rally. The markets are oversold. I don't think we needed much of an excuse (for a rebound),"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The agreement ""is not a ceasefire, it's just a de-escalation. The existing tariffs are still having a negative impact on the Chinese economy, they haven't gone away."" The White House said Beijing had agreed to buy an unspecified but ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. It said the two sides would launch new talks to address issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and non-tariff barriers. But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. China praised the ""important consensus"" reached in the deal, but did not mention the 90-day deadline. Despite the differences in the wording and uncertainty about some details, the agreement was a better outcome than investors had expected, said Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities in Shanghai. At the same time, the outcome of the meeting is ""unlikely to immediately spark a turnaround in market sentiment,"" he said. ""While this means the effect of the trade war may pause for a moment, we're still facing domestic issues including slowing growth, and awaiting more information about the direction of macroeconomic policy and eagerly expected measures like tax cuts."" In onshore trade, the yuan was trading at 6.9174 per dollar at midday, after opening at 6.9278. It has lost more than 6 percent of its value so far this year as trade ties deteriorated and the US dollar firmed. The offshore yuan firmed to as high as 6.8950, and was trading at 6.9110 at midday. ""The impact on the yuan was very positive, and has prompted many market participants building up long positions in the Chinese unit,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. ""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment."" Ken Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, was less optimistic. ""The gap between China and the US ... remains quite wide, and it is very difficult for them to reach a comprehensive deal in 90 days,"" Cheung said, adding that he doesn't see ""much further movement"" for the rebound. Commodities also rallied on hopes of thawing relations. Prices of Chinese steel products and steelmaking ingredients soared more than 6 percent. ""We are expecting China to buy more LNG, LPG, corn and soybean to step up imports from US,"" said Michael Mao, energy analyst with consultancyChina Sublime Information Group. ""(The) government is also likely to issue a new import tax on these products to facilitate imports."" But some analysts cautioned about reading too much into Monday's rally. ""The fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, referring to the day's gains. ""Worries about the trade war have subsided, so investors are shifting their focus back to other things, like a stronger renminbi (or) a lower pace of rate hikes from the Fed."" China's factory activity grew slightly in November, a private survey showed on Monday, but new export orders shrank at a faster pace and manufacturers reported they were cutting prices amid soft domestic demand. The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November which showed growth in the nation's vast factory sector had effectively stalled."

a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions. The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei. China summons US envoy to protest detention China summoned the US ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Meng's detention. The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng ""lodged solemn representations and strong protests"" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention. The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention ""extremely egregious"" and demanded the US vacate an order for her arrest.  It quoted Le as calling for the US to ""immediately correct its wrong actions"" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges
of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a
Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30
years for each charge. No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after
nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the
hearing was adjourned until Monday. In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to
release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to
lodge a ""strong protest."" Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond
what the Minister said yesterday"". Freeland told reporters on Friday that relationship with
China is important and valued, and Canada's ambassador in
Beijing has assured Chinese that consular access will be
provided to Meng. When asked about the possible Chinese backlash after the
arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship
with Beijing. Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States
while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach
of her lawful rights, Le said. The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its
very nature ""extremely nasty,"" he added. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately
release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful,
legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full
responsibility for the serious consequences caused."" The statement did not elaborate. ""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in
high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former
Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday. ""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice
box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that.
That's the price of dealing with a country like China."" Meng's arrest was on the same day that US President Donald
Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways
to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two
largest economies. “We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you
to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,” said a
US State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The news of Meng's arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn
condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his
top economic advisers have played down its importance to trade
talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce. A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has ""every
confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach
the right conclusion."" The company has said it complies with all

Iran may yet survive.,6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"The EU along with Russia and China have opposed the Trump administration on trashing the Iran nuclear deal. Iran may yet survive.  As the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, sanctions were imposed on Tehran. The second phase, which was announced on November 5, was described as some of the most stringent sanctions ever by Trump. This new wave of coercive measures targets critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as energy, shipping and shipbuilding and the financial sectors. Punitive measures are nothing new to the Islamic Republic. The country has been under sanctions by the US for almost 40 years. The Iranian authorities claim they developed the resilience needed to deal with sanctions no matter how tough they are. In this context, President Hassan Rouhani stated: “We will proudly break these illegal, unjust sanctions.” The US often resorts to coercive economic measures as part of its diplomatic pressure on states that do not align with Washington's foreign policy objectives. Such policies are not only meant to show the economic strength and overall dominance of the US as a superpower, but they also intend to provoke uprisings in the poverty-stricken populace. However, there is a gap between theory and practice, and many experts believe that these policies do not break the grip of regimes in power, as seen in the cases of Venezuela, Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea. The more recent sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been entirely futile. Sanctions only harmed the poor people of these countries rather than bringing policy changes by their respective governments, just because the regimes’ ‘centres of gravity’ are usually shielded from the effect of the sanctions. Also, the sanctioned states become a lot more aggressive and use repressive means that thwart any uprising plans. Besides, economic strictures are counter-productive. Iran has lived under different boycotts, and its regime built its political legitimacy on anti-American rhetoric. The authorities will merely use this new wave of sanctions to unite the people under its leadership further. In fact, huge demonstrations already took place on November 4 to protest against the US policies. Despite claims to the contrary, the first affected will be the low-income population and the working class as they are not capable of dealing with the expected impact of the US-imposed measures. The middle class will also have trouble with sanctions due to high inflation rates which will deplete the purchasing power for all Iranians. While Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions will not involve food, medicine and basic humanitarian goods, US measures have already restricted the transfer of money which affects the importation of food and medicine. The price for medication, such as the one needed for cancer treatment, has become exorbitant. Additionally, Iranians living abroad will also be heavily impacted because of the restrictions on Iran's banking system. SWIFT, the international system for money transfer, removed its access to the Central Bank of Iran. Consequently, countless Iranian students may not be able to receive money transfers from Iran. Interestingly, the US exempted eight countries from sanctions on importing Iranian oil for six months, so they can still do business with Iran. Some observers considered such a step indicates which nations are being treated favourably by Trump. Others estimate that this exemption demonstrates the failure of this policy, which was imposed unilaterally and could not get support from Europe and other countries. Iran has emerged cleared of any wrongdoing in this particular case. Tehran has been committed to the nuclear agreement and has respected its part of the deal. The US, on the other hand, seems to be in breach of international law. Besides, by moving against Tehran unilaterally, the White House is damaging its transatlantic relations and undermining its allies. Consequently, the Trump administration has not won the battle for world public opinion given that it pursues a bellicose course of action without any valid reasons. In the foreseeable future, the United States is not likely to remove sanctions or change course in its approach vis-à-vis Iran. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic will adapt to the new situation by finding ways to export its oil and gas via different routes. The Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his confidence that the Iranian oil industry would find markets. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.” Geopolitically, Tehran will seek - more than ever - to damage US client states in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia. The latter has been considerably weakened by its ill-conceived war in Yemen and the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Also, it is predicted that Tehran will get closer to Moscow and cement their strategic relationships. Finally, Tehran will enhance its relations with neighbouring countries, which provide a crucial lifeline for Iran’s economy. These measures mean that Trump’s approach is not only doomed to fail but it also does not serve the purpose for which it was initially intended.      "

In this file photo taken on January 13, 2014 Michael Spavor walks with former US basketball player Dennis Rodman (not in picture) as they are surrounded by the media after arriving at Beijing International Airport from North Korea. China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of ""engaging in activities that endanger the national security"" of China. Lu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living. ""The legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,"" Lu told reporters at a daily briefing. Canada under growing pressure  The two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The US has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud. Canadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor ""since he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,"" Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said Wednesday. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government."" Kovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong. Spavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North's government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North's capital Pyongyang in 2013. Acquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up. ""National security charge"" The detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt's detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada's arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the US. The broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organisations. The root of the dispute appears to be Canada's arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of US sanctions. China earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn't released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of ""retaliatory measures"" if Canada doesn't free Meng. ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,"" Hu Xijin said, speaking in English. Canada asks China for extra security at its embassy Canada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters. The United States and China have emphasised that China-US trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction on Tuesday, saying he'd intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview. The suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump's assertion, saying: ""Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canadais, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law."" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was ""quite obvious"" any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure ""the process is not politicised."" ""Both Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,"" said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney. ""Trump's remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the US's reputation as a country that follows the 'rule of law,' and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks."" Trump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. US regulators planned to bar it from receiving US components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because US tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations. Speaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng's case. ""Let's see what he actually decides,"" Ross said. ""Let's see where we go from there."""

Previously, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained. The detentions came after Canadian police arrested Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a regular news conference in Beijing, China on January 6, 2016. A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, a Canadian newspaper reported on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese telecoms executive. Canada's foreign ministry said it was ""aware of a Canadian citizen"" having been detained, according to the National Post, which cited a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson did not provide further details and did not suggest that the detention was linked to the arrest on December 1 of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the report said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that she had ""not heard"" about the reported detention. The recent detention of two Canadians has raised questions whether Beijing is holding them in retaliation for Meng's arrest, though no link has officially been made between the cases. Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings Huawei is alleged to have had with Iran. National security concerns  China has accused the other detainees – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor – of activities ""that endanger China's national security."" They were both detained on December 10. Kovrig is a Hong Kong-based senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, while Spavor facilitates trips to North Korea and helped former NBA star Dennis Rodman travel to the neighbouring country. Beijing has threatened Canada with ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not freed and Chinese state-run media have criticised the arrest, saying it was politically motivated. Ottawa has repeatedly said the arrest was not political but rather a judicial process in keeping with an extradition treaty Ottawa has with Washington. But despite escalating tensions between the two countries, the Canadian embassy in China does not seem to be holding back. On Tuesday it posted a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Charter 08, a widely circulated online petition that called for political reform in China, on Chinese social media. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died last year from liver cancer while in police custody, was arrested after co-authoring the petition, which urged protection of basic human rights and the reform of China's one-party system. "

Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

""The Taiwan issue concerns the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and is the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations,"" Geng said.   ""We urge the US  side to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiques, prudently and properly handling Taiwan-related issues so as not to harm China-US relations as well as the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" he added.  ""Self-ruled island"" The voyage risks further heightening tensions with China, which considers Taiwan its own and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement late on Thursday the ships were moving in a northerly direction and that their voyage was in accordance with regulations. It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

Yao Jing, China’s ambassador in Islamabad, also praised Pakistan’s role in facilitating the Afghan peace process -- including its efforts to facilitate talks between the Taliban and US  -- and helping end the long conflict in Afghanistan.

In 2015, Pakistan facilitated the landmark first round of direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Islamabad, but the process broke down after Taliban announced the death of their longtime leader Mullah Omer, triggering a bitter power struggle within the militia. Chances for resumption of the stalled process dimmed further following the death of Omer’s successor, Mullah Mansur, in a US drone strike in 2016 on Pakistan, near the Afghan border. Since then, several attempts to resume the stalled peace process have been made by a four-nation group made up of Pakistan, Afghanistan, the US, and China"

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest. (Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-un firm backing in deadlocked nuclear talks with the United States, insisting the two sides should meet ""halfway"", Chinese state media said on Thursday. Kim visited Beijing this week for two days of talks that reasserted China's role in the process, and were seen as a strategy session ahead of an expected second summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump. At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday on an unannounced visit for talks with President Xi Jinping, as preparations ramp up for an expected second summit with Donald Trump. South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. A motorcade was seen leaving a Beijing train station, with police blocking a street with metal gates hours after Kim's train crossed the border into northern China, according to AFP journalists. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Hong Kong for more. Last year, Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the US and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that US State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The US State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. ""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. ""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."" At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005.

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

Both governments have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fight over US complaints that Beijing violates its market-opening obligations by stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Trump and Xi agreed to postpone additional tariff hikes for 90 days, but economists say that is too little time to resolve the sprawling disputes that bedevil US-Chinese relations.

A banner is reflected on a polished surface as China's President Xi Jinping (C) speaks during an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 2, 2019. Taiwan's unification with the mainland is ""inevitable"", President Xi Jinping said on January 2, warning against any effort to promote the island's independence and saying China would not renounce the option of military force to bring it into the fold. With détente seeming to settle upon the Korean peninsula, East Asia’s most dangerous flashpoint may now be Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping is morphing into a better dressed version of Mao Zedong and reviving Mao-style policies throughout the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and beyond. One of his targets, the subject of his New Year’s address, is Taiwan. Up until January 1, forty years ago, there were two Chinas. At least, until then the US formally recognised the Republic of China, located on the island of Taiwan, which claimed to be the legitimate government of all China. No one really believed that, and Washington had begun talking with Beijing in 1972. After that countries accelerated their shift in recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The mainland’s diplomatic advantage grew along with its economy. Today just 16 small, mostly African and Latin American nations, recognise the ROC, which has been denied independent status in international organisations as well. However, even that does not satisfy the Xi government, which wants “reunification”. The island has been out of the mainland’s control for more than 120 years, other than a brief period after World War II. On New Year’s Day, Xi gave a major speech addressing Taiwan, expressing his government’s willingness “to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”. However, he warned: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures [to achieve Beijing’s ends].” Which sounds like American presidents who proclaim that “all options are the table,” code words threatening war. Xi sought to paint a positive picture of Chinese control: “Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.” Alas, he offered no guarantees to preserve Taiwan’s free society and democratic system. Nor would any such promises be believable. Xi’s turn toward totalitarianism, including the incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in reeducation camps, creates a fearsome prospect for a united future. While he cited Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework as the model, Beijing has steadily tightened its control over that territory, despite pledging to preserve British-style liberties. Even before Xi’s reincarnation as Mao, the Taiwanese people turned decisively against “reunification” with China. A vanishingly small proportion of the young identify with the mainland. Their connection with the PRC is minimal; Taiwan is their home. And they have no reason to voluntarily choose what amounts to a foreign dictatorship, which during its worst times proved to be one of the bloodiest tyrannies in human history. But even if the mainland were democratic, why would the Taiwanese want to be submerged in the neighbouring colossus? Take away the idea of defence against foreign invaders, and the only country threatening to attack Taiwan is the PRC, there is no reason for the former to become just another brick in a Chinese imperial wall. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen spoke a day before Xi, insisting that his government respect Taiwanese liberty and democracy. Her party did badly in the recent elections, but that did not reflect a pro-Beijing surge, rather, domestic issues dominated. Taiwan’s people recognise that a declaration of independence would risk war, so most support today’s ambiguous status. If the Chinese leadership was equally accommodating, the situation would be stable. But Xi, especially, appears determined to force a decision, which risks war and would significantly affect the rest of the region. Although the PRC’s military strength greatly exceeds that of Taiwan, an invasion would be difficult. Washington has, at best, an ambiguous military commitment to Taiwan; the president would not want war with the PRC, but would also be loath to walk away from an ally of more than seven decades. Economic sanctions, at least, would be inevitable; even Europe would likely respond to an attack on the island. Any victory by Beijing would be dearly bought. Instead, all the players need to find a compromise. For instance, while continuing to claim full sovereignty over Taiwan, the PRC should affirm its commitment to peace and withdraw some of its missiles targeted on the island. While preparing to defend itself if necessary, Taipei should eschew policies that highlight its independent existence internationally. While the US should continue selling Taiwan weapons to deter attack, the former should pledge to neither seek bases on the island nor intervene in any conflict which might erupt between Beijing and Taipei. The world is very different to 40 years ago. Unfortunately, the possibility of war over Taiwan is significantly greater today. Any military confrontation would be a disaster to all concerned. Perhaps the best China, Taiwan, and America can do is peacefully kick the controversy down the road — again."

Uighur boy is seen flying a kite in this file photo. The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper reported earlier this week that in the country's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region 1,120,000 civil servants were staying as guests at 1, 690,000 households, most of which are Muslim Uighurs. According to the paper, the officials staying at the houses, ""share their bread, celebrate holidays together, help the children with homework, develop friendships, encourage the feeling of 'National Unity and Family' and take families to Urumqi, the capital of the region for activities."" It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits. Among the civil servants staying in the homes of Uighur families, it was reported that there were public officials from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region armed forces, the Armed Police Units and the Chinese central government's representatives. The report also suggested that last year in Xinjiang, encouraged by the officials of the ""National Union and Family"" activities deepened the national unity, strengthening the links between the party officials and the local people, ""the CCP's voice was heard by thousands of families,"" the report added. An official speaking to the paper said, ""The villagers are eagerly looking forward to a modern lifestyle and understanding the good policies of the party. Nowadays, the relationship between the party and the people is rapidly developing. The villagers are ... embracing the modern civilization movement. Their lifestyle has changed and so has their thoughts."" Uighur representatives living outside of China have reacted harshly to the practice, saying officials staying at the houses on behalf of the communist party are actually there to spy on the families. Responding to the allegations, China has strongly refuted any suggestion that it is mistreating the Uighur minority. Previously, Hu Lianhe, a spokesman for China's United Front Work Department, had told a UN panel. ""There is no arbitrary detention or lack of freedom of religion and belief."" ""Xinjiang citizens including the Uighurs enjoy equal freedoms and rights."" Hu said, ""there is no such thing as re-education centres,"" but added criminals convicted of ""minor offences"" have been assigned to ""vocational educational and employment training centres with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation."" ""They are not subject to any arbitrary detention or ill-treatment there,"" Hu added."

Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman slammed Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, saying it is a ""great embarrassment"" in a written statement on Sunday. Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.  The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a Chinese state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.  ""China, show us their videos if they are alive!"" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter.  He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.  No camps China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated one million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. The country has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and UN rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who live predominantly in a region claimed by Uighurs in China, which they call East Turkistan and is home to some 10 million people, most of whom are Muslim. Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centres where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education.  Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism. Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity.""  Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the ""concentration camps"" and ""systematic assimilation"" to which Muslims in Xinjiang are subject. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement ""a very bad mistake."" Heyit under investigation Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an ""absurd lie.""  She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security. The video shows Heyit in a grey sweater against a nondescript, grey wall. He states his name and gives the date as February 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused. The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed. Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive. The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result, many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media.  On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings. If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

(April 7, 2017) As leaders of the world's top economic powers seek to defuse tension over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, they will search for common ground on reforms to end a crisis at the institution that was created to prevent economic disputes escalating into war. The World Trade Organization is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional, just when it is most needed to fulfil its role as umpire in trade disputes and as the watchdog of global commerce. ""If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said last week. ""The WTO is doing all it can to support efforts to de-escalate the situation, but finding solutions will require political will and it will require leadership from the G20."" Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing on the effects the US-China trade war has on Chinese exporters.  The WTO has fallen victim to Trump's trade war on economic rival China and the United States has put pressure on the WTO itself to reform. Trump is unhappy with the WTO's failure to hold Beijing to account for failing to open its economy as envisioned when China joined the WTO in 2001. To force reform at the WTO, Trump's team has blocked new appointments to the world's top trade court, the WTO's Appellate Body which is now rapidly running out of judges, meaning it will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. If there are not enough judges, ""disputes go into limbo,"" former Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman said. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States earlier this year. Those, and his tariffs on Chinese imports, have drawn retaliatory tariffs, and represent the kind of dispute the WTO was created to help resolve. Numerous countries have filed litigation at the WTO to contest the tariffs. But if the WTO is unable to rule on them, Trump's aggressive policies cannot be deemed to be illegal and could continue with impunity. The US government has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to force concessions that would change the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. Chinese and US officials negotiating easing the trade tensions were making progress on Friday at a Group of 20 summit in Argentina, a Chinese official said. Court with no judges The US metals tariffs have caused a storm because they are based on what Washington says are national security concerns, which makes them exempt from WTO rules. But other countries dispute the link to national security, and are challenging it at the WTO. They fear Trump could use the same reasoning to put import tariffs on cars and other goods. Time is running out because the Appellate Body now has the minimum three members it needs to function and from December 2019 it will be down to one, so only appeals that get underway by that date have a prospect of being resolved. There is a big backlog of cases going through the WTO dispute settlement process, so the metals tariffs are unlikely to be ruled on and appealed within that time frame. ""The new cases of the US duties on steel and aluminium will not be decided... they will not finish before (the end of) 2019,"" former Appellate Body member Giorgio Sacerdoti said. Another major dispute at the WTO concerns the refusal by the European Union and the United States to recognise China as a ""market economy"" whose goods are fairly priced by the market. They say the Chinese state's involvement in the economy has created a steel and aluminium supply glut. China is pursuing legal action against the EU. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said a ruling in China's favour ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO"". That case is also bogged down. Even if the appeal lands in time, there is another potential hitch. The Appellate Body's Chinese member, Hong Zhao, may have to recuse herself because of a potential conflict of interest, which would make it impossible to decide on any appeal in the case, several trade experts told Reuters. ""It’s a very difficult situation for her,"" one diplomat said. Chinese, US, EU and WTO officials declined to comment on whether or not Zhao would need to be recused."

At the midday break, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index was 2.9 percent higher and blue-chip shares surged 3.1 percent. Government bond futures fell as shares rallied, with the 10-year treasury futures for March delivery, the most-traded contract, falling 0.26 percent at the open. It was last down 0.07 percent at 96.630. Shares in Hong Kong also jumped, with the Hang Seng index adding 2.7 percent at midday, and breaking through the 27,000 level for the first time since October 4. The China Enterprises Index is 2.8 percent higher at midday. ""This is a relief rally. The markets are oversold. I don't think we needed much of an excuse (for a rebound),"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The agreement ""is not a ceasefire, it's just a de-escalation. The existing tariffs are still having a negative impact on the Chinese economy, they haven't gone away."" The White House said Beijing had agreed to buy an unspecified but ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. It said the two sides would launch new talks to address issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and non-tariff barriers. But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. China praised the ""important consensus"" reached in the deal, but did not mention the 90-day deadline. Despite the differences in the wording and uncertainty about some details, the agreement was a better outcome than investors had expected, said Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities in Shanghai. At the same time, the outcome of the meeting is ""unlikely to immediately spark a turnaround in market sentiment,"" he said. ""While this means the effect of the trade war may pause for a moment, we're still facing domestic issues including slowing growth, and awaiting more information about the direction of macroeconomic policy and eagerly expected measures like tax cuts."" In onshore trade, the yuan was trading at 6.9174 per dollar at midday, after opening at 6.9278. It has lost more than 6 percent of its value so far this year as trade ties deteriorated and the US dollar firmed. The offshore yuan firmed to as high as 6.8950, and was trading at 6.9110 at midday. ""The impact on the yuan was very positive, and has prompted many market participants building up long positions in the Chinese unit,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. ""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment."" Ken Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, was less optimistic. ""The gap between China and the US ... remains quite wide, and it is very difficult for them to reach a comprehensive deal in 90 days,"" Cheung said, adding that he doesn't see ""much further movement"" for the rebound. Commodities also rallied on hopes of thawing relations. Prices of Chinese steel products and steelmaking ingredients soared more than 6 percent. ""We are expecting China to buy more LNG, LPG, corn and soybean to step up imports from US,"" said Michael Mao, energy analyst with consultancyChina Sublime Information Group. ""(The) government is also likely to issue a new import tax on these products to facilitate imports."" But some analysts cautioned about reading too much into Monday's rally. ""The fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, referring to the day's gains. ""Worries about the trade war have subsided, so investors are shifting their focus back to other things, like a stronger renminbi (or) a lower pace of rate hikes from the Fed."" China's factory activity grew slightly in November, a private survey showed on Monday, but new export orders shrank at a faster pace and manufacturers reported they were cutting prices amid soft domestic demand. The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November which showed growth in the nation's vast factory sector had effectively stalled."

An illustration shows a journalist reading a news page about tech giant Huawei in The Globe and Mail in Montreal, Canada, December 6, 2018. China warned Canada on
Saturday that there would be severe consequences if it did not
immediately release Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief
financial officer, calling the case ""extremely nasty."" Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's global chief financial officer, was
arrested in Canada on December 1 and faces extradition to the United
States, which alleges that she covered up her company's links to
a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions. The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei. China summons US envoy to protest detention China summoned the US ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Meng's detention. The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng ""lodged solemn representations and strong protests"" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention. The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention ""extremely egregious"" and demanded the US vacate an order for her arrest.  It quoted Le as calling for the US to ""immediately correct its wrong actions"" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges
of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a
Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30
years for each charge. No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after
nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the
hearing was adjourned until Monday. In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to
release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to
lodge a ""strong protest."" Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond
what the Minister said yesterday"". Freeland told reporters on Friday that relationship with
China is important and valued, and Canada's ambassador in
Beijing has assured Chinese that consular access will be
provided to Meng. When asked about the possible Chinese backlash after the
arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship
with Beijing. Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States
while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach
of her lawful rights, Le said. The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its
very nature ""extremely nasty,"" he added. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately
release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful,
legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full
responsibility for the serious consequences caused."" The statement did not elaborate. ""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in
high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former
Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday. ""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice
box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that.
That's the price of dealing with a country like China."" Meng's arrest was on the same day that US President Donald
Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways
to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two
largest economies. “We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you
to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,” said a
US State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The news of Meng's arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn
condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his
top economic advisers have played down its importance to trade
talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce. A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has ""every
confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach
the right conclusion."" The company has said it complies with all
applicable export control and sanctions laws and other
regulations."

Iran may yet survive.,6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"The EU along with Russia and China have opposed the Trump administration on trashing the Iran nuclear deal. Iran may yet survive.  As the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, sanctions were imposed on Tehran. The second phase, which was announced on November 5, was described as some of the most stringent sanctions ever by Trump. This new wave of coercive measures targets critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as energy, shipping and shipbuilding and the financial sectors. Punitive measures are nothing new to the Islamic Republic. The country has been under sanctions by the US for almost 40 years. The Iranian authorities claim they developed the resilience needed to deal with sanctions no matter how tough they are. In this context, President Hassan Rouhani stated: “We will proudly break these illegal, unjust sanctions.” The US often resorts to coercive economic measures as part of its diplomatic pressure on states that do not align with Washington's foreign policy objectives. Such policies are not only meant to show the economic strength and overall dominance of the US as a superpower, but they also intend to provoke uprisings in the poverty-stricken populace. However, there is a gap between theory and practice, and many experts believe that these policies do not break the grip of regimes in power, as seen in the cases of Venezuela, Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea. The more recent sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been entirely futile. Sanctions only harmed the poor people of these countries rather than bringing policy changes by their respective governments, just because the regimes’ ‘centres of gravity’ are usually shielded from the effect of the sanctions. Also, the sanctioned states become a lot more aggressive and use repressive means that thwart any uprising plans. Besides, economic strictures are counter-productive. Iran has lived under different boycotts, and its regime built its political legitimacy on anti-American rhetoric. The authorities will merely use this new wave of sanctions to unite the people under its leadership further. In fact, huge demonstrations already took place on November 4 to protest against the US policies. Despite claims to the contrary, the first affected will be the low-income population and the working class as they are not capable of dealing with the expected impact of the US-imposed measures. The middle class will also have trouble with sanctions due to high inflation rates which will deplete the purchasing power for all Iranians. While Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions will not involve food, medicine and basic humanitarian goods, US measures have already restricted the transfer of money which affects the importation of food and medicine. The price for medication, such as the one needed for cancer treatment, has become exorbitant. Additionally, Iranians living abroad will also be heavily impacted because of the restrictions on Iran's banking system. SWIFT, the international system for money transfer, removed its access to the Central Bank of Iran. Consequently, countless Iranian students may not be able to receive money transfers from Iran. Interestingly, the US exempted eight countries from sanctions on importing Iranian oil for six months, so they can still do business with Iran. Some observers considered such a step indicates which nations are being treated favourably by Trump. Others estimate that this exemption demonstrates the failure of this policy, which was imposed unilaterally and could not get support from Europe and other countries. Iran has emerged cleared of any wrongdoing in this particular case. Tehran has been committed to the nuclear agreement and has respected its part of the deal. The US, on the other hand, seems to be in breach of international law. Besides, by moving against Tehran unilaterally, the White House is damaging its transatlantic relations and undermining its allies. Consequently, the Trump administration has not won the battle for world public opinion given that it pursues a bellicose course of action without any valid reasons. In the foreseeable future, the United States is not likely to remove sanctions or change course in its approach vis-à-vis Iran. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic will adapt to the new situation by finding ways to export its oil and gas via different routes. The Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his confidence that the Iranian oil industry would find markets. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.” Geopolitically, Tehran will seek - more than ever - to damage US client states in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia. The latter has been considerably weakened by its ill-conceived war in Yemen and the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Also, it is predicted that Tehran will get closer to Moscow and cement their strategic relationships. Finally, Tehran will enhance its relations with neighbouring countries, which provide a crucial lifeline for Iran’s economy. These measures mean that Trump’s approach is not only doomed to fail but it also does not serve the purpose for which it was initially intended.      "

In this file photo taken on January 13, 2014 Michael Spavor walks with former US basketball player Dennis Rodman (not in picture) as they are surrounded by the media after arriving at Beijing International Airport from North Korea. China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of ""engaging in activities that endanger the national security"" of China. Lu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living. ""The legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,"" Lu told reporters at a daily briefing. Canada under growing pressure  The two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The US has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud. Canadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor ""since he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,"" Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said Wednesday. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government."" Kovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong. Spavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North's government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North's capital Pyongyang in 2013. Acquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up. ""National security charge"" The detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt's detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada's arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the US. The broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organisations. The root of the dispute appears to be Canada's arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of US sanctions. China earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn't released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of ""retaliatory measures"" if Canada doesn't free Meng. ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,"" Hu Xijin said, speaking in English. Canada asks China for extra security at its embassy Canada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters. The United States and China have emphasised that China-US trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction on Tuesday, saying he'd intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview. The suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump's assertion, saying: ""Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canadais, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law."" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was ""quite obvious"" any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure ""the process is not politicised."" ""Both Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,"" said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney. ""Trump's remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the US's reputation as a country that follows the 'rule of law,' and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks."" Trump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. US regulators planned to bar it from receiving US components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because US tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations. Speaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng's case. ""Let's see what he actually decides,"" Ross said. ""Let's see where we go from there."""

Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a regular news conference in Beijing, China on January 6, 2016. A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, a Canadian newspaper reported on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese telecoms executive. Canada's foreign ministry said it was ""aware of a Canadian citizen"" having been detained, according to the National Post, which cited a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson did not provide further details and did not suggest that the detention was linked to the arrest on December 1 of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the report said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that she had ""not heard"" about the reported detention. The recent detention of two Canadians has raised questions whether Beijing is holding them in retaliation for Meng's arrest, though no link has officially been made between the cases. Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings Huawei is alleged to have had with Iran. National security concerns  China has accused the other detainees – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor – of activities ""that endanger China's national security."" They were both detained on December 10. Kovrig is a Hong Kong-based senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, while Spavor facilitates trips to North Korea and helped former NBA star Dennis Rodman travel to the neighbouring country. Beijing has threatened Canada with ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not freed and Chinese state-run media have criticised the arrest, saying it was politically motivated. Ottawa has repeatedly said the arrest was not political but rather a judicial process in keeping with an extradition treaty Ottawa has with Washington. But despite escalating tensions between the two countries, the Canadian embassy in China does not seem to be holding back. On Tuesday it posted a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Charter 08, a widely circulated online petition that called for political reform in China, on Chinese social media. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died last year from liver cancer while in police custody, was arrested after co-authoring the petition, which urged protection of basic human rights and the reform of China's one-party system. "

US President Donald Trump, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, US President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018. China will roll back tariffs on US-made cars, US President Donald Trump said, unveiling another potential breakthrough in a trade war truce that cheered stock markets on Monday. Trump's surprise announcement late Sunday came a day after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to suspend any new tariffs and give negotiators 90 days to strike a deal. TRT World's Caitlin McGee reports. The ceasefire follows months of tensions and tit-for-tat custom duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods that raised fears of an escalation harmful to the global economy. Both sides gained from hitting the pause button, with Trump securing a Chinese pledge to import more US goods and Xi staving off the further pressure that higher tariffs would place on his country's slowing economy. Trump tweeted that China had agreed to ""reduce and remove"" tariffs of 40 percent on cars, though Beijing has yet to confirm the move. China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%. China's foreign ministry declined to confirm Trump's assertion on Monday, instead saying: ""On December 1 President Xi and President Trump reached an important consensus on trade issues."" ""They agreed to hold off on the imposition of new tariffs and came up with a series of constructive arrangements on how to address the existing differences and problems,"" spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. Trump's tweet did not explain which tariffs would be reduced or removed, or when China would act. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the car announcement, if confirmed, was ""certainly movement in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of more things to come"". Beijing had reduced auto import duties from 25 percent to 15 percent in July. But it later added a 25 percent tariff on US-made cars as trade tensions soared, bringing them to 40 percent. Many US automakers build their cars in China for the local market, but the tariff hikes have hit sales and profits for some companies including electric car-maker Tesla and US-made models from BMW and Ford. IP theft  One expert said China would have to address US complaints about China's forced transfer of intellectual property rights - a major issue at the core of a US ""301"" trade investigation -- for Washington to drop its tariffs. ""Any action which increases market access or better ensures a level playing field will certainly be welcomed and could lead to continued discussions,"" Steven Okun, a Singapore-based senior advisor at strategic advisory firm McLarty Associates, told AFP. ""Still, one must presume that as the existing and proposed tariffs are to spur China to address the US' IPR concerns, only action directly related to that would ultimately impact the 301 tariffs,"" he said. The White House said Saturday the two sides would ""immediately"" begin talks on ""structural changes"" affecting forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection and cyber theft. China reaffirmed that the agreement held ""great significance"". ""It prevents the economic and trade frictions from expanding and opens new prospects for cooperation,"" Geng said. 'No magic wand'  Asian and European stock markets jumped on Monday, with Hong Kong and Shanghai closing sharply higher and the yuan strengthening after months of trade-war turbulence. After being spooked by the conflict, investors returned to buying following the long-awaited meeting between the two presidents. But observers warned there were still major issues that needed to be resolved, including access for US companies and intellectual property protection. ""In order to really make a difference, China needs to enact more sweeping comprehensive reforms in the short term,"" Zarit said. China's state-run media cautiously welcomed the Buenos Aires agreement. The nationalist Global Times tabloid called it a ""momentous step forward"" that brings ""huge potential for fair trade"". ""It is hoped that the trade teams from both countries will reach as many practical agreements as possible and as quickly as possible to hasten China-US cooperation,"" the daily said. Under the agreement, Trump is shelving a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent from the start of next year - but the hike will kick in if negotiators fail to reach a final deal within 90 days. The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and they remain in effect despite the truce. China has hit back with similar tariffs on $110 billion worth of goods made in the US. ""No magic wand has been waved to make the differences between the United States and China vanish overnight,"" the state-run China Daily warned. ""Given the complexity of interactions between the two economies, the rest of the world will still be holding its collective breath while it waits to see if the series of constructive plans that are in the works can put bilateral relations back on a cooperative rather than confrontational track,"" it said."

China's President Xi Jinping listens to his Panamanian counterpart Juan Carlos Varela (not pictured) while delivering a joint message after a private meeting as part of Xi's first state visit to Panama, at Presidential Palace in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Portugal on Tuesday for a two-day visit to strengthen ties, amid concern in some EU capitals over China's growing influence on the continent. Fresh from a visit to Spain last week, his two-day stay in Portugal will include a meeting with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and the signing of cooperation agreements. One of them will bring the Portuguese port of Sines, in the southwest, into what China calls the ""new Silk Road"", an initiative that offers loans to build railways, roads and ports across Asia, Europe and Africa. In an op-ed published on Sunday in Portuguese newspapers, President Xi stressed the importance of China's relationship with Portugal as part of a broader network of trade links. But China's growing influence in Europe, welcomed by Greece and several eastern European countries, is viewed warily by others on the continent. At the initiative of France and Germany, EU countries last week agreed a framework regulating foreign investment, particularly from China. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Friday that Lisbon did not back the idea and was relieved that the final accord provided for only an advisory role on the part of the European Commission. Foreign investment does not worry Portugal, and the EU should not ""take the path of protectionism"" in the face of globalisation, he said. Portugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries, was open to Chinese investment after being hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis. Its 78 billion euro ($88 billion) EU-IMF rescue package in 2011 came with required austerity policies - and a wide-ranging privatisation programme that opened the doors to Chinese investment. Chinese investment accounted for 3.6 percent of Portugal's GDP between 2010 and 2016, according to figures from Spain's ESADE business school. China now owns a 28 percent stake in Portuguese energy utility EDP, the country's largest firm, via China Three Gorges and China's state-owned international investment company CNIC. It also has a stake in Portugal's biggest private bank, BCP, and its leading insurance company, Fidelidade. Seeking 'large-scale investment' Perhaps the most contentious issue is China Three Gorges' bid to take a controlling stake in EDP, of which it is already the main stakeholder. The operation, launched in May, involves some nine billion euros. But while it has been welcomed by the Portuguese government it still risks running foul of barriers imposed by regulators in around 15 countries where EDP operates - including the United States. Luis Castro Henriques, head of Portugal's trade and investment agency AICEP, says Chinese investment in Portugal has been good for the country. China has risen to Portugal's 11th-largest trade partner in the decade since 2008, when it was 28th on the list. ""We want now to attract large-scale industrial investment, notably in the automobile and agro-food sectors,"" Castro Henriques said."

China's President Xi Jinping speaks as he gives a joint statement to the press along with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela (out of frame) after holding a meeting, at the presidential palace in Panama City, on December 3, 2018. China said on Wednesday that Beijing and Washington will push forward with trade negotiations in the next 90 days and it is confident that an agreement can be reached, as doubts grow over whether the two sides can resolve their deep differences. The Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement on its website, also said China would work to implement specific issues already agreed upon as quickly as possible. The ministry's statement follows a period of relative quiet from Beijing after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. Scepticism on deal The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. But the mood has quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides will be able to reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period that was agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh US tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March. The Commerce Ministry said China-US trade and economic discussions were ""very successful"". The statement did not mention Trump or Xi, however, the state news agency Xinhua later said the ministry statement was hailing their meeting. ""We are confident in implementation...The economic and trade teams from both sides will actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map,"" it said. ""The Chinese side will start with implementing specifics on which there is already consensus, the faster the better."" Deal or tariffs Trump, via Twitter, threatened to place ""major tariffs"" on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. ""We are either going to have a real deal with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future,"" Trump wrote in a post within minutes of the Commerce Ministry statement. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the leaders' meeting, and there have been some differences between US and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails. A Chinese official told Reuters officials were ""waiting for the leaders to return"" before publicising details. President Xi Jinping and his most senior officials, including the commerce minister and the country's two top diplomats, are in Portugal, and due back in China on Thursday. US financial markets tumbled on Tuesday as doubts over what could realistically get accomplished in the tight negotiating window added to concerns about fading global growth."

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani gives a public speech during a trip to the northern Iranian city of Shahroud, Iran, on December 4, 2018. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said US sanctions were ""economic terrorism"", as he sought to foster a united front from visiting regional officials on Saturday. Addressing parliament speakers from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey, Rouhani said they had all suffered economic pressure from the US. ""We are facing an all-out assault which is not only threatening our independence and identity but also is bent on breaking our longstanding ties,"" he said. The Trump administration in Washington has reimposed an oil embargo and other damaging sanctions on Iran since withdrawing in May from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers. ""America's unjust and illegal sanctions against the honourable nation of Iran have targeted our nation in a clear instance of terrorism,"" Rouhani said. ""Economic terrorism is designed to create panic in the economy of a country and fear in other countries in order to prevent investment."" The conference in Tehran was a second annual meeting of parliament speakers focused on terrorism and regional cooperation. The first was held last December in Islamabad. Most participating countries have faced harsh sanctions and other economic pressure as part of the Trump administration's use of trade as a diplomatic weapon. A brief truce in Trump's trade war with China was again in doubt this week after the arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who was detained in Canada to face fraud charges in the US. Washington has continued to pile fresh sanctions on Russia that began over its military intervention in Ukraine, while two Turkish ministers also faced temporary sanctions this year over the detention of an American pastor. 'We are all punished'  Trump has also cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, accusing it of failing to crack down on militancy. ""When they put pressure on China's trade, we are all harmed... By punishing Turkey, we are all punished. Any time they threaten Russia, we too consider our security to be endangered,"" Rouhani said. ""When they impose sanctions on Iran, they deprive all of us of the benefits of international trade, energy security and sustainable development. And in fact, they impose sanctions on everyone. ""We are here to say that we don't intend to tolerate such insolence."" Rouhani warned Europe - which has strongly objected to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal - that much is at stake in its efforts to bypass US sanctions and maintain trade with Iran. ""They should know that by sanctioning Iran, they would harm our ability to fight drugs and terrorism,"" Rouhani said, referring to Iran's efforts to combat smuggling, particularly from Afghanistan. The European Union is working on a payment system, known as the ""special purpose vehicle"", to keep money flowing into Iran, but has struggled to find a host since many countries fear repercussions from the Trump administration."

Michael Kovrig, an employee with the International Crisis Group and former Canadian diplomat appears in this photo provided by the International Crisis Group in Brussels, Belgium on December 11, 2018. A former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, two sources said on Tuesday, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release. Michael Kovrig's detention comes after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on December 1 at the request of US authorities, a move that has infuriated Beijing. It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China. ""International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its North East Asia Senior Adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,"" the think-tank said in a statement. ""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,"" it added. China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to questions faxed about Kovrig's detention. The exact reason for the detention, which was made sometime early this week, according to the sources, was not immediately clear. The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa. Calls to Kovrig's phones were not answered. Diplomatic spat Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017. From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Following Meng's arrest, China on Saturday summoned Canada's ambassador in Beijing and warned of severe ""consequences"" if Ottawa did not see that she was immediately released. Meng is set to return to a Vancouver courtroom on Tuesday, as the judge weighs final issues in determining whether she should be freed on bail while awaiting proceedings for her possible extradition to the United States. Washington has made accusations that Meng misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring severe penalties. Locked in a bitter trade war, Washington and Beijing earlier this month agreed to delay a planned January 1 increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, allowing more time to negotiate over China's huge bilateral trade surplus and US complaints that it steals technology. Chinese experts have said that Beijing was trying to separate Meng's arrest from the trade negotiations, but also warned that public anger in China over Canada's move could compel officials there to take measures that would further sour US-China ties and endanger talks. In 2014, a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, were detained a week after Canada accused China of hacking into the national computer system. Kevin Garratt was charged with spying, but released and deported after he spent two years in detention. "

The Chinese national flag flies in front of a Catholic church in the village of Huangtuang, Hebei province, China, September 30, 2018. A second bishop from China's 'underground' Catholic church is stepping aside and is being replaced by a government-backed clergyman, state-run media reported, amid a thaw in relations between Beijing and the Vatican. There are an estimated 10 million Catholics in China, divided between a government-run association whose clergy are approved by the Communist Party, and the unofficial church which answers to the Vatican. An agreement struck in September on the appointment of bishops has paved the way for a rapprochement between China and the Holy See, which cut off diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1951. Zhuang Jianjian, bishop of the Shantou diocese in southern China will retire and be replaced by Huang Bingzhang, deputy chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the Global Times reported. The Vatican-issued mandate was given to Huang last week by a delegation from Rome that met several Chinese bishops, the state-linked paper reported. ""The mission now is to unite Catholics in the diocese and reduce divergence so as to achieve the common goal of better serving church members,"" Huang told the Global Times. ""This doesn't come as a surprise because Zhuang Jianjian is already 88, so he would have wanted to retire more than a decade ago,"" said Anthony Lam, a Chinese Catholic church expert at Hong Kong's Holy Spirit Study Centre. According to canon laws that govern the Catholic church, bishops ""are requested"" to submit their resignation at the age of 75. The Catholic pope can either approve the resignation or request that they wait for a suitable successor to emerge, Lam said. ""The agreement between China and the Vatican has solved this problem because the seven bishops previously excommunicated have been restored to the church, so Huang Bingzhang will be able to take up the position."" The Vatican excommunicated Huang in 2011 for being ordained as a bishop without papal approval. This is a slightly different situation from that of fellow underground bishop Guo Xijin, who was last week asked to step aside in the eastern Fujian province to make way for government-approved clergy, Lam noted. Guo instead will serve as ""auxiliary bishop"" – someone who assists and works alongside the diocesan bishop – while both the unofficial and official churches of the diocese will merge. Guo's case was at the centre of last week's negotiations between China and the Vatican, which have been asking him to leave his post since 2017 to allow for talks aimed at ending their decades-old spat. Separately, the official church said it is facing a lack of bishops and called for ""politically reliable"" clergymen with ""good ethics,"" the Global Times reported on Wednesday. Nearly half of China's 98 Catholic dioceses have no leaders, chairman of the China Bishops Conference Ma Yinglin told a seminar, according to the paper."

Eight people were killed and 22 injured after a hijacked bus crashed into pedestrians in east China's Fujian province on Tuesday afternoon, state media reported. A hijacker carrying a knife had been detained and was being investigated by local police, state television CGTN reported. A video posted by Duowei news, a Chinese media outlet based in the US, showed several injured people lying on the street near a crashed bus.  It also showed police wrestling a person to the ground. Blood could also be seen on the steps of the bus, which had been stopped in the middle of a road. State-run news agency Xinhua reported the suspect was a 48-year-old local man surnamed Qiu. He had attacked a female passenger before taking control of the bus, Duowei reported. Police said that on the day of the attack the suspect had quarrelled with a local official who had visited his home, adding that the pair had a long history of conflict, according to the Xinhua report. The 22 wounded in the attack were taken to local hospitals, with one person being treated for ""serious injures"", Xinhua said. Spate of attacks China has suffered a spate of similar incidents this year. In late November, a car ploughed into a group of children crossing a street in front of an elementary school in the northeastern Liaoning province, killing five people and injuring at least 19. The driver said he ""chose his victims at random"" and had reportedly been contemplating suicide due to domestic troubles before the tragedy occurred. In October, three people were killed when a man fleeing after committing a stabbing drove into a crowd and attacked onlookers in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The month before, a man ploughed a truck into a crowd in Hunan province and went on a rampage, attacking onlookers with knives and a shovel. Eleven died and 44 were injured. Grisly car accidents are common in China, where transportation authorities have struggled to uphold safety regulations – which are often flouted or go unenforced. According to authorities 58,000 people were killed in accidents across the country in 2015 alone. Last month, at least 13 people died when a bus plunged off a bridge in Chongqing municipality, after the driver got into a fist fight with a passenger who had missed her bus stop. Search and rescue teams dispatched more than 70 boats, as well as a team of scuba divers and underwater robots, to find the wreckage and retrieve bodies from the water."

A plainclothes police officer stands outside the courthouse where prominent rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang is being tried in Tianjin, China December 26, 2018. Chinese police locked down a courthouse on Wednesday at the start of the trial of a prominent rights lawyer who is accused of inciting subversion of state power and whose case has attracted widespread concern in Western capitals. Wang Quanzhang, who took on sensitive cases of complaints of police torture and defended practitioners of the banned Falun Gong cult, went missing in August 2015 during a sweeping crackdown on rights activists. Most cases from that summer, known as the 709 cases for the first day of detentions on July 9, 2015, have concluded. Wang, however, was incommunicado for more than 1,000 days. An investigation said he had ""for a long time been influenced by infiltrating anti-China forces"" and had been trained by overseas groups and accepted their funding, according to a copy of the indictment seen by Reuters. Police outside the court in the northern city of Tianjin told reporters they could not get near the building because it was a closed trial. One supporter stood outside the courthouse shouting ""Wang Quanzhang is a good person"" and ""I support Wang Quanzhang"" before police forced him into a car and drove him away. There were also several Western diplomats outside the courthouse, who were likewise not allowed in. The indictment says Wang worked with Peter Dahlin, a Swedish rights worker who was detained in China for three weeks before being deported in 2016, and others to ""train hostile forces"", as well as actively providing investigative reports overseas. It also says Wang had hyped up and distorted the facts in his online statements about the case of a policeman who killed a petitioner in Heilongjiang in 2014 and of ""cults"" that he had defended. Dahlin, now in Madrid, said on Twitter they had kept all documentation dating back to 2009 ""and will release anything needed to dispel that it constitutes subverting state power."" Calls to the court seeking comment went unanswered. The trial could last just a single day, although a verdict may not come immediately. Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, says she has been unable to visit her husband since he went missing. She said seven lawyers she appointed to try to represent Wang had also been unable to visit him. Li said in a statement sent to Reuters state security agents had followed her when she left her Beijing home and blocked off the six entrances to her compound. She decided she would be unable to go to Tianjin after more than an hour spent trying to leave, she said. It was not possible to reach the State Security Ministry for comment because it has no website or publicly available telephone number. Chinese President Xi Jinping has strengthened efforts to quash dissent since coming to power six years ago, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained and dozens jailed. China routinely rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record, saying all Chinese are treated equally in accordance with the law and that foreign countries have no right to interfere. Doriane Lau, China researcher at Amnesty International, earlier this week raised questions about the timing of the trial on December 26, saying: ""We think this is deliberate because obviously a big part of the world will be having a holiday and will not be able to respond."""

jailed for life a former high-ranking secret police official for
taking bribes, ""coercive"" business deals and insider trading,
the court said. Ma Jian, once a vice minister at the Ministry of State
Security, is one of the most senior security officials to be
jailed since the former domestic security tsar Zhou Yongkang was
ensnared in a graft scandal and jailed for life in 2015. Ma's case is linked to that of China's most wanted fugitive,
exiled tycoon Guo Wengui, who lives in New York and has courted
international attention with his explosive claims about the
leadership of the ruling Communist Party. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court said in a statement
on its website that it had reached the verdict on the grounds
that Ma had taken a ""particularly enormous"" amount of bribes,
and that his collaboration with Guo's company were ""particularly
serious"". Ma had used his position to conspire with Guo and to help
businesses Guo controlled by using threats to bring about
illegal transactions such as compelling individuals to transfer
company shares, the court said. Ma had received more than $14.56 million (100 million yuan)
in property for his work and earned nearly 5 million yuan from
trading stocks based on insider information, the court said. Ma said that he accepted the ruling and would not appeal,
according to the court said. It was not possible to contact Ma for comment. Guo could not
immediately be reached for comment. Ma was put under investigation for corruption in 2015 and
expelled from the Communist Party the following year after
prosecutors accused him of interfering in unspecified law
enforcement activities. Dozens of senior officials have been investigated or jailed
since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, vowing to root
out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the
Communist Party’s grip on power. The powerful state security ministry spies on its citizens
and foreigners domestically and internationally. It is one of
the most opaque agencies in China and does not have a public
website or spokesman.

US and Chinese negotiators start two days of high-level talks Wednesday aimed at settling a six-month trade war that has weakened both sides, shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy. Yet the odds seem stacked against any substantive resolution this week to the standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Perhaps the best that might be hoped for, analysts say, is for the two sides to agree to keep talking. The differences between Beijing and Washington are vast. The United States is essentially demanding that China downsize its economic aspiration to become a supreme world leader in such fields as robotics and electric cars. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Alibaba's CEO, Daniel Zhang noted that China has more than one billion consumers, and he maintains that as long as conditions are right, it can be a self-sufficient market."" The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December.

Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

But exports contracted in December as the penalties began to dampen demand. Growth in investment, retail sales and other indicators also slowed."

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

Geng made the comments in response to the passage by two US warships through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday. He said China has closely monitored the passage from start to end and expressed its concerns to the US  side.

Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement late on Thursday the ships were moving in a northerly direction and that their voyage was in accordance with regulations. It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

(Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

US President Donald Trump tweeted that they were ""going really well!"" Asian stock markets responded well to the news that the two-day meetings would extend to three days. US Dollar and China Yuan notes are seen in this picture illustration. Three days of US-Chinese talks aimed at ending a costly tariff battle wrapped up Wednesday in an optimistic atmosphere after President Donald Trump said they were ""going very well!"" No details were immediately announced, but Asian stock markets rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un poses for photos in Pyongyang on January 1, 2019 (Credit: North Korea's Korean Central News Agency). North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday on an unannounced visit for talks with President Xi Jinping, as preparations ramp up for an expected second summit with Donald Trump. South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. A motorcade was seen leaving a Beijing train station, with police blocking a street with metal gates hours after Kim's train crossed the border into northern China, according to AFP journalists. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Hong Kong for more. Last year, Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the US and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that US State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The US State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. ""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. ""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."" At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea's foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks."""

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

According to the paper, the officials staying at the houses, ""share their bread, celebrate holidays together, help the children with homework, develop friendships, encourage the feeling of 'National Unity and Family' and take families to Urumqi, the capital of the region for activities."" It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits.

Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman slammed Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, saying it is a ""great embarrassment"" in a written statement on Sunday. Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

A man who identifies himself as Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit is seen in this still image taken from a video posted online by China Radio International's Turkish language service on February 10, 2019. Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.  The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a Chinese state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.  ""China, show us their videos if they are alive!"" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter.  He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.  No camps China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated one million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. The country has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and UN rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who live predominantly in a region claimed by Uighurs in China, which they call East Turkistan and is home to some 10 million people, most of whom are Muslim. Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centres where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education.  Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism. Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity.""  Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the ""concentration camps"" and ""systematic assimilation"" to which Muslims in Xinjiang are subject. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement ""a very bad mistake."" Heyit under investigation Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an ""absurd lie.""  She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security. The video shows Heyit in a grey sweater against a nondescript, grey wall. He states his name and gives the date as February 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused. The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed. Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive. The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result, many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media.  On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings. If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

US President Donald Trump, left, gestures as he and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida in this file photo. (April 7, 2017) As leaders of the world's top economic powers seek to defuse tension over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, they will search for common ground on reforms to end a crisis at the institution that was created to prevent economic disputes escalating into war. The World Trade Organization is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional, just when it is most needed to fulfil its role as umpire in trade disputes and as the watchdog of global commerce. ""If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said last week. ""The WTO is doing all it can to support efforts to de-escalate the situation, but finding solutions will require political will and it will require leadership from the G20."" Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing on the effects the US-China trade war has on Chinese exporters.  The WTO has fallen victim to Trump's trade war on economic rival China and the United States has put pressure on the WTO itself to reform. Trump is unhappy with the WTO's failure to hold Beijing to account for failing to open its economy as envisioned when China joined the WTO in 2001. To force reform at the WTO, Trump's team has blocked new appointments to the world's top trade court, the WTO's Appellate Body which is now rapidly running out of judges, meaning it will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. If there are not enough judges, ""disputes go into limbo,"" former Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman said. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States earlier this year. Those, and his tariffs on Chinese imports, have drawn retaliatory tariffs, and represent the kind of dispute the WTO was created to help resolve. Numerous countries have filed litigation at the WTO to contest the tariffs. But if the WTO is unable to rule on them, Trump's aggressive policies cannot be deemed to be illegal and could continue with impunity. The US government has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to force concessions that would change the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. Chinese and US officials negotiating easing the trade tensions were making progress on Friday at a Group of 20 summit in Argentina, a Chinese official said. Court with no judges The US metals tariffs have caused a storm because they are based on what Washington says are national security concerns, which makes them exempt from WTO rules. But other countries dispute the link to national security, and are challenging it at the WTO. They fear Trump could use the same reasoning to put import tariffs on cars and other goods. Time is running out because the Appellate Body now has the minimum three members it needs to function and from December 2019 it will be down to one, so only appeals that get underway by that date have a prospect of being resolved. There is a big backlog of cases going through the WTO dispute settlement process, so the metals tariffs are unlikely to be ruled on and appealed within that time frame. ""The new cases of the US duties on steel and aluminium will not be decided... they will not finish before (the end of) 2019,"" former Appellate Body member Giorgio Sacerdoti said. Another major dispute at the WTO concerns the refusal by the European Union and the United States to recognise China as a ""market economy"" whose goods are fairly priced by the market. They say the Chinese state's involvement in the economy has created a steel and aluminium supply glut. China is pursuing legal action against the EU. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said a ruling in China's favour ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO"". That case is also bogged down. Even if the appeal lands in time, there is another potential hitch. The Appellate Body's Chinese member, Hong Zhao, may have to recuse herself because of a potential conflict of interest, which would make it impossible to decide on any appeal in the case, several trade experts told Reuters. ""It’s a very difficult situation for her,"" one diplomat said. Chinese, US, EU and WTO officials declined to comment on whether or not Zhao would need to be recused."

People walk under an electronic board showing stock information at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Lujiazui Financial Area before the visit of Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in Shanghai, China, September 22, 2015 Chinese shares, commodities and the yuan currency jumped on Monday after Chinese and US leaders agreed to a temporary truce in their bitter trade war, but the longer-term outlook for trade relations remains murky. The deal between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping postponed the most pressing threat to the global and Chinese economies - a sharp hike in US tariffs that had been slated for January 1. But analysts cautioned it has only bought a bit more time for wrangling over deeply divisive trade and policy differences, and said China's economy will continue to cool regardless under the weight of weakening domestic demand. Still, the news offered some relief for the country's battered stock markets, which had tumbled over 20 percent at one point this year, prompting a flurry of support measures. At the midday break, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index was 2.9 percent higher and blue-chip shares surged 3.1 percent. Government bond futures fell as shares rallied, with the 10-year treasury futures for March delivery, the most-traded contract, falling 0.26 percent at the open. It was last down 0.07 percent at 96.630. Shares in Hong Kong also jumped, with the Hang Seng index adding 2.7 percent at midday, and breaking through the 27,000 level for the first time since October 4. The China Enterprises Index is 2.8 percent higher at midday. ""This is a relief rally. The markets are oversold. I don't think we needed much of an excuse (for a rebound),"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The agreement ""is not a ceasefire, it's just a de-escalation. The existing tariffs are still having a negative impact on the Chinese economy, they haven't gone away."" The White House said Beijing had agreed to buy an unspecified but ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. It said the two sides would launch new talks to address issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and non-tariff barriers. But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. China praised the ""important consensus"" reached in the deal, but did not mention the 90-day deadline. Despite the differences in the wording and uncertainty about some details, the agreement was a better outcome than investors had expected, said Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities in Shanghai. At the same time, the outcome of the meeting is ""unlikely to immediately spark a turnaround in market sentiment,"" he said. ""While this means the effect of the trade war may pause for a moment, we're still facing domestic issues including slowing growth, and awaiting more information about the direction of macroeconomic policy and eagerly expected measures like tax cuts."" In onshore trade, the yuan was trading at 6.9174 per dollar at midday, after opening at 6.9278. It has lost more than 6 percent of its value so far this year as trade ties deteriorated and the US dollar firmed. The offshore yuan firmed to as high as 6.8950, and was trading at 6.9110 at midday. ""The impact on the yuan was very positive, and has prompted many market participants building up long positions in the Chinese unit,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. ""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment."" Ken Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, was less optimistic. ""The gap between China and the US ... remains quite wide, and it is very difficult for them to reach a comprehensive deal in 90 days,"" Cheung said, adding that he doesn't see ""much further movement"" for the rebound. Commodities also rallied on hopes of thawing relations. Prices of Chinese steel products and steelmaking ingredients soared more than 6 percent. ""We are expecting China to buy more LNG, LPG, corn and soybean to step up imports from US,"" said Michael Mao, energy analyst with consultancyChina Sublime Information Group. ""(The) government is also likely to issue a new import tax on these products to facilitate imports."" But some analysts cautioned about reading too much into Monday's rally. ""The fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, referring to the day's gains. ""Worries about the trade war have subsided, so investors are shifting their focus back to other things, like a stronger renminbi (or) a lower pace of rate hikes from the Fed."" China's factory activity grew slightly in November, a private survey showed on Monday, but new export orders shrank at a faster pace and manufacturers reported they were cutting prices amid soft domestic demand. The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November which showed growth in the nation's vast factory sector had effectively stalled."

Saturday that there would be severe consequences if it did not
immediately release Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief
financial officer, calling the case ""extremely nasty."" Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's global chief financial officer, was
arrested in Canada on December 1 and faces extradition to the United
States, which alleges that she covered up her company's links to
a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions. The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei. China summons US envoy to protest detention China summoned the US ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Meng's detention. The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng ""lodged solemn representations and strong protests"" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention. The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention ""extremely egregious"" and demanded the US vacate an order for her arrest.  It quoted Le as calling for the US to ""immediately correct its wrong actions"" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges
of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a
Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30
years for each charge. No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after
nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the
hearing was adjourned until Monday. In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to
release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to
lodge a ""strong protest."" Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond
what the Minister said yesterday"". Freeland told reporters on Friday that relationship with
China is important and valued, and Canada's ambassador in
Beijing has assured Chinese that consular access will be
provided to Meng. When asked about the possible Chinese backlash after the
arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship
with Beijing. Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States
while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach
of her lawful rights, Le said. The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its
very nature ""extremely nasty,"" he added. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately
release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful,
legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full
responsibility for the serious consequences caused."" The statement did not elaborate. ""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in
high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former
Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday. ""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice
box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that.
That's the price of dealing with a country like China."" Meng's arrest was on the same day that US President Donald
Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways
to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two
largest economies. “We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you
to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,” said a
US State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The news of Meng's arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn
condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his
top economic advisers have played down its importance to trade
talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce. A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has ""every
confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach
the right conclusion."" The company has said it complies with all

Iran may yet survive.,6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"The EU along with Russia and China have opposed the Trump administration on trashing the Iran nuclear deal. Iran may yet survive.  As the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, sanctions were imposed on Tehran. The second phase, which was announced on November 5, was described as some of the most stringent sanctions ever by Trump. This new wave of coercive measures targets critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as energy, shipping and shipbuilding and the financial sectors. Punitive measures are nothing new to the Islamic Republic. The country has been under sanctions by the US for almost 40 years. The Iranian authorities claim they developed the resilience needed to deal with sanctions no matter how tough they are. In this context, President Hassan Rouhani stated: “We will proudly break these illegal, unjust sanctions.” The US often resorts to coercive economic measures as part of its diplomatic pressure on states that do not align with Washington's foreign policy objectives. Such policies are not only meant to show the economic strength and overall dominance of the US as a superpower, but they also intend to provoke uprisings in the poverty-stricken populace. However, there is a gap between theory and practice, and many experts believe that these policies do not break the grip of regimes in power, as seen in the cases of Venezuela, Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea. The more recent sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been entirely futile. Sanctions only harmed the poor people of these countries rather than bringing policy changes by their respective governments, just because the regimes’ ‘centres of gravity’ are usually shielded from the effect of the sanctions. Also, the sanctioned states become a lot more aggressive and use repressive means that thwart any uprising plans. Besides, economic strictures are counter-productive. Iran has lived under different boycotts, and its regime built its political legitimacy on anti-American rhetoric. The authorities will merely use this new wave of sanctions to unite the people under its leadership further. In fact, huge demonstrations already took place on November 4 to protest against the US policies. Despite claims to the contrary, the first affected will be the low-income population and the working class as they are not capable of dealing with the expected impact of the US-imposed measures. The middle class will also have trouble with sanctions due to high inflation rates which will deplete the purchasing power for all Iranians. While Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions will not involve food, medicine and basic humanitarian goods, US measures have already restricted the transfer of money which affects the importation of food and medicine. The price for medication, such as the one needed for cancer treatment, has become exorbitant. Additionally, Iranians living abroad will also be heavily impacted because of the restrictions on Iran's banking system. SWIFT, the international system for money transfer, removed its access to the Central Bank of Iran. Consequently, countless Iranian students may not be able to receive money transfers from Iran. Interestingly, the US exempted eight countries from sanctions on importing Iranian oil for six months, so they can still do business with Iran. Some observers considered such a step indicates which nations are being treated favourably by Trump. Others estimate that this exemption demonstrates the failure of this policy, which was imposed unilaterally and could not get support from Europe and other countries. Iran has emerged cleared of any wrongdoing in this particular case. Tehran has been committed to the nuclear agreement and has respected its part of the deal. The US, on the other hand, seems to be in breach of international law. Besides, by moving against Tehran unilaterally, the White House is damaging its transatlantic relations and undermining its allies. Consequently, the Trump administration has not won the battle for world public opinion given that it pursues a bellicose course of action without any valid reasons. In the foreseeable future, the United States is not likely to remove sanctions or change course in its approach vis-à-vis Iran. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic will adapt to the new situation by finding ways to export its oil and gas via different routes. The Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his confidence that the Iranian oil industry would find markets. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.” Geopolitically, Tehran will seek - more than ever - to damage US client states in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia. The latter has been considerably weakened by its ill-conceived war in Yemen and the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Also, it is predicted that Tehran will get closer to Moscow and cement their strategic relationships. Finally, Tehran will enhance its relations with neighbouring countries, which provide a crucial lifeline for Iran’s economy. These measures mean that Trump’s approach is not only doomed to fail but it also does not serve the purpose for which it was initially intended.      "

In this file photo taken on January 13, 2014 Michael Spavor walks with former US basketball player Dennis Rodman (not in picture) as they are surrounded by the media after arriving at Beijing International Airport from North Korea. China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of ""engaging in activities that endanger the national security"" of China. Lu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living. ""The legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,"" Lu told reporters at a daily briefing. Canada under growing pressure  The two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The US has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud. Canadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor ""since he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,"" Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said Wednesday. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government."" Kovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong. Spavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North's government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North's capital Pyongyang in 2013. Acquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up. ""National security charge"" The detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt's detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada's arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the US. The broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organisations. The root of the dispute appears to be Canada's arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of US sanctions. China earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn't released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of ""retaliatory measures"" if Canada doesn't free Meng. ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,"" Hu Xijin said, speaking in English. Canada asks China for extra security at its embassy Canada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters. The United States and China have emphasised that China-US trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction on Tuesday, saying he'd intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview. The suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump's assertion, saying: ""Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canadais, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law."" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was ""quite obvious"" any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure ""the process is not politicised."" ""Both Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,"" said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney. ""Trump's remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the US's reputation as a country that follows the 'rule of law,' and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks."" Trump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. US regulators planned to bar it from receiving US components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because US tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations. Speaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng's case. ""Let's see what he actually decides,"" Ross said. ""Let's see where we go from there."""

Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed early this month to a 90-day truce in the trade dispute, which halted the threatened escalation of punitive tariffs while the two sides continue negotiations. Accomplishments cited  In his speech, Xi enumerated the accomplishments of China's development. ""Grain coupons, cloth coupons, meat coupons, fish coupons, oil coupons, tofu coupons, food ticket books, product coups and other documents people once could not be without have now been consigned to the museum of history,"" he said.

Previously, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained. The detentions came after Canadian police arrested Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a regular news conference in Beijing, China on January 6, 2016. A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, a Canadian newspaper reported on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese telecoms executive. Canada's foreign ministry said it was ""aware of a Canadian citizen"" having been detained, according to the National Post, which cited a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson did not provide further details and did not suggest that the detention was linked to the arrest on December 1 of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the report said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that she had ""not heard"" about the reported detention. The recent detention of two Canadians has raised questions whether Beijing is holding them in retaliation for Meng's arrest, though no link has officially been made between the cases. Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings Huawei is alleged to have had with Iran. National security concerns  China has accused the other detainees – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor – of activities ""that endanger China's national security."" They were both detained on December 10. Kovrig is a Hong Kong-based senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, while Spavor facilitates trips to North Korea and helped former NBA star Dennis Rodman travel to the neighbouring country. Beijing has threatened Canada with ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not freed and Chinese state-run media have criticised the arrest, saying it was politically motivated. Ottawa has repeatedly said the arrest was not political but rather a judicial process in keeping with an extradition treaty Ottawa has with Washington. But despite escalating tensions between the two countries, the Canadian embassy in China does not seem to be holding back. On Tuesday it posted a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Charter 08, a widely circulated online petition that called for political reform in China, on Chinese social media. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died last year from liver cancer while in police custody, was arrested after co-authoring the petition, which urged protection of basic human rights and the reform of China's one-party system. "

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping emphasised on cooperation between the two countries as they held talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Friday. President Erdogan said he is pleased that Turkey-China relations have kept developing and deepening. The Turkish side looks forward to carrying out closer high-level exchanges with China, speaks highly of the Belt and Road Initiative, and is ready to deepen cooperation with China in areas such as trade and economy, investment, aviation and tourism within the Belt and Road framework, he said.

He called on the relevant departments of the two countries to cooperate closely to fully implement the consensus achieved by him and the Turkish president and strive for tangible results. Xi said China supports the efforts by Turkey to maintain its steady development.  The Chinese side is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Turkey to jointly oppose protectionism and unilateralism and safeguard the common interest of emerging market economies, the Chinese President added."

US President Donald Trump, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, US President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018. China will roll back tariffs on US-made cars, US President Donald Trump said, unveiling another potential breakthrough in a trade war truce that cheered stock markets on Monday. Trump's surprise announcement late Sunday came a day after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to suspend any new tariffs and give negotiators 90 days to strike a deal. TRT World's Caitlin McGee reports. The ceasefire follows months of tensions and tit-for-tat custom duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods that raised fears of an escalation harmful to the global economy. Both sides gained from hitting the pause button, with Trump securing a Chinese pledge to import more US goods and Xi staving off the further pressure that higher tariffs would place on his country's slowing economy. Trump tweeted that China had agreed to ""reduce and remove"" tariffs of 40 percent on cars, though Beijing has yet to confirm the move. China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%. China's foreign ministry declined to confirm Trump's assertion on Monday, instead saying: ""On December 1 President Xi and President Trump reached an important consensus on trade issues."" ""They agreed to hold off on the imposition of new tariffs and came up with a series of constructive arrangements on how to address the existing differences and problems,"" spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. Trump's tweet did not explain which tariffs would be reduced or removed, or when China would act. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the car announcement, if confirmed, was ""certainly movement in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of more things to come"". Beijing had reduced auto import duties from 25 percent to 15 percent in July. But it later added a 25 percent tariff on US-made cars as trade tensions soared, bringing them to 40 percent. Many US automakers build their cars in China for the local market, but the tariff hikes have hit sales and profits for some companies including electric car-maker Tesla and US-made models from BMW and Ford. IP theft  One expert said China would have to address US complaints about China's forced transfer of intellectual property rights - a major issue at the core of a US ""301"" trade investigation -- for Washington to drop its tariffs. ""Any action which increases market access or better ensures a level playing field will certainly be welcomed and could lead to continued discussions,"" Steven Okun, a Singapore-based senior advisor at strategic advisory firm McLarty Associates, told AFP. ""Still, one must presume that as the existing and proposed tariffs are to spur China to address the US' IPR concerns, only action directly related to that would ultimately impact the 301 tariffs,"" he said. The White House said Saturday the two sides would ""immediately"" begin talks on ""structural changes"" affecting forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection and cyber theft. China reaffirmed that the agreement held ""great significance"". ""It prevents the economic and trade frictions from expanding and opens new prospects for cooperation,"" Geng said. 'No magic wand'  Asian and European stock markets jumped on Monday, with Hong Kong and Shanghai closing sharply higher and the yuan strengthening after months of trade-war turbulence. After being spooked by the conflict, investors returned to buying following the long-awaited meeting between the two presidents. But observers warned there were still major issues that needed to be resolved, including access for US companies and intellectual property protection. ""In order to really make a difference, China needs to enact more sweeping comprehensive reforms in the short term,"" Zarit said. China's state-run media cautiously welcomed the Buenos Aires agreement. The nationalist Global Times tabloid called it a ""momentous step forward"" that brings ""huge potential for fair trade"". ""It is hoped that the trade teams from both countries will reach as many practical agreements as possible and as quickly as possible to hasten China-US cooperation,"" the daily said. Under the agreement, Trump is shelving a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent from the start of next year - but the hike will kick in if negotiators fail to reach a final deal within 90 days. The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and they remain in effect despite the truce. China has hit back with similar tariffs on $110 billion worth of goods made in the US. ""No magic wand has been waved to make the differences between the United States and China vanish overnight,"" the state-run China Daily warned. ""Given the complexity of interactions between the two economies, the rest of the world will still be holding its collective breath while it waits to see if the series of constructive plans that are in the works can put bilateral relations back on a cooperative rather than confrontational track,"" it said."

China's President Xi Jinping listens to his Panamanian counterpart Juan Carlos Varela (not pictured) while delivering a joint message after a private meeting as part of Xi's first state visit to Panama, at Presidential Palace in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Portugal on Tuesday for a two-day visit to strengthen ties, amid concern in some EU capitals over China's growing influence on the continent. Fresh from a visit to Spain last week, his two-day stay in Portugal will include a meeting with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and the signing of cooperation agreements. One of them will bring the Portuguese port of Sines, in the southwest, into what China calls the ""new Silk Road"", an initiative that offers loans to build railways, roads and ports across Asia, Europe and Africa. In an op-ed published on Sunday in Portuguese newspapers, President Xi stressed the importance of China's relationship with Portugal as part of a broader network of trade links. But China's growing influence in Europe, welcomed by Greece and several eastern European countries, is viewed warily by others on the continent. At the initiative of France and Germany, EU countries last week agreed a framework regulating foreign investment, particularly from China. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Friday that Lisbon did not back the idea and was relieved that the final accord provided for only an advisory role on the part of the European Commission. Foreign investment does not worry Portugal, and the EU should not ""take the path of protectionism"" in the face of globalisation, he said. Portugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries, was open to Chinese investment after being hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis. Its 78 billion euro ($88 billion) EU-IMF rescue package in 2011 came with required austerity policies - and a wide-ranging privatisation programme that opened the doors to Chinese investment. Chinese investment accounted for 3.6 percent of Portugal's GDP between 2010 and 2016, according to figures from Spain's ESADE business school. China now owns a 28 percent stake in Portuguese energy utility EDP, the country's largest firm, via China Three Gorges and China's state-owned international investment company CNIC. It also has a stake in Portugal's biggest private bank, BCP, and its leading insurance company, Fidelidade. Seeking 'large-scale investment' Perhaps the most contentious issue is China Three Gorges' bid to take a controlling stake in EDP, of which it is already the main stakeholder. The operation, launched in May, involves some nine billion euros. But while it has been welcomed by the Portuguese government it still risks running foul of barriers imposed by regulators in around 15 countries where EDP operates - including the United States. Luis Castro Henriques, head of Portugal's trade and investment agency AICEP, says Chinese investment in Portugal has been good for the country. China has risen to Portugal's 11th-largest trade partner in the decade since 2008, when it was 28th on the list. ""We want now to attract large-scale industrial investment, notably in the automobile and agro-food sectors,"" Castro Henriques said."

China's President Xi Jinping speaks as he gives a joint statement to the press along with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela (out of frame) after holding a meeting, at the presidential palace in Panama City, on December 3, 2018. China said on Wednesday that Beijing and Washington will push forward with trade negotiations in the next 90 days and it is confident that an agreement can be reached, as doubts grow over whether the two sides can resolve their deep differences. The Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement on its website, also said China would work to implement specific issues already agreed upon as quickly as possible. The ministry's statement follows a period of relative quiet from Beijing after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. Scepticism on deal The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. But the mood has quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides will be able to reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period that was agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh US tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March. The Commerce Ministry said China-US trade and economic discussions were ""very successful"". The statement did not mention Trump or Xi, however, the state news agency Xinhua later said the ministry statement was hailing their meeting. ""We are confident in implementation...The economic and trade teams from both sides will actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map,"" it said. ""The Chinese side will start with implementing specifics on which there is already consensus, the faster the better."" Deal or tariffs Trump, via Twitter, threatened to place ""major tariffs"" on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. ""We are either going to have a real deal with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future,"" Trump wrote in a post within minutes of the Commerce Ministry statement. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the leaders' meeting, and there have been some differences between US and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails. A Chinese official told Reuters officials were ""waiting for the leaders to return"" before publicising details. President Xi Jinping and his most senior officials, including the commerce minister and the country's two top diplomats, are in Portugal, and due back in China on Thursday. US financial markets tumbled on Tuesday as doubts over what could realistically get accomplished in the tight negotiating window added to concerns about fading global growth."

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said US sanctions were ""economic terrorism"", as he sought to foster a united front from visiting regional officials on Saturday. Addressing parliament speakers from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey, Rouhani said they had all suffered economic pressure from the US. ""We are facing an all-out assault which is not only threatening our independence and identity but also is bent on breaking our longstanding ties,"" he said. The Trump administration in Washington has reimposed an oil embargo and other damaging sanctions on Iran since withdrawing in May from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers. ""America's unjust and illegal sanctions against the honourable nation of Iran have targeted our nation in a clear instance of terrorism,"" Rouhani said. ""Economic terrorism is designed to create panic in the economy of a country and fear in other countries in order to prevent investment."" The conference in Tehran was a second annual meeting of parliament speakers focused on terrorism and regional cooperation. The first was held last December in Islamabad. Most participating countries have faced harsh sanctions and other economic pressure as part of the Trump administration's use of trade as a diplomatic weapon. A brief truce in Trump's trade war with China was again in doubt this week after the arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who was detained in Canada to face fraud charges in the US. Washington has continued to pile fresh sanctions on Russia that began over its military intervention in Ukraine, while two Turkish ministers also faced temporary sanctions this year over the detention of an American pastor. 'We are all punished'  Trump has also cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, accusing it of failing to crack down on militancy. ""When they put pressure on China's trade, we are all harmed... By punishing Turkey, we are all punished. Any time they threaten Russia, we too consider our security to be endangered,"" Rouhani said. ""When they impose sanctions on Iran, they deprive all of us of the benefits of international trade, energy security and sustainable development. And in fact, they impose sanctions on everyone. ""We are here to say that we don't intend to tolerate such insolence."" Rouhani warned Europe - which has strongly objected to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal - that much is at stake in its efforts to bypass US sanctions and maintain trade with Iran. ""They should know that by sanctioning Iran, they would harm our ability to fight drugs and terrorism,"" Rouhani said, referring to Iran's efforts to combat smuggling, particularly from Afghanistan. The European Union is working on a payment system, known as the ""special purpose vehicle"", to keep money flowing into Iran, but has struggled to find a host since many countries fear repercussions from the Trump administration."

A former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, two sources said on Tuesday, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release. Michael Kovrig's detention comes after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on December 1 at the request of US authorities, a move that has infuriated Beijing. It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China. ""International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its North East Asia Senior Adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,"" the think-tank said in a statement. ""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,"" it added. China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to questions faxed about Kovrig's detention. The exact reason for the detention, which was made sometime early this week, according to the sources, was not immediately clear. The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa. Calls to Kovrig's phones were not answered. Diplomatic spat Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017. From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Following Meng's arrest, China on Saturday summoned Canada's ambassador in Beijing and warned of severe ""consequences"" if Ottawa did not see that she was immediately released. Meng is set to return to a Vancouver courtroom on Tuesday, as the judge weighs final issues in determining whether she should be freed on bail while awaiting proceedings for her possible extradition to the United States. Washington has made accusations that Meng misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring severe penalties. Locked in a bitter trade war, Washington and Beijing earlier this month agreed to delay a planned January 1 increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, allowing more time to negotiate over China's huge bilateral trade surplus and US complaints that it steals technology. Chinese experts have said that Beijing was trying to separate Meng's arrest from the trade negotiations, but also warned that public anger in China over Canada's move could compel officials there to take measures that would further sour US-China ties and endanger talks. In 2014, a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, were detained a week after Canada accused China of hacking into the national computer system. Kevin Garratt was charged with spying, but released and deported after he spent two years in detention. "

The Chinese national flag flies in front of a Catholic church in the village of Huangtuang, Hebei province, China, September 30, 2018. A second bishop from China's 'underground' Catholic church is stepping aside and is being replaced by a government-backed clergyman, state-run media reported, amid a thaw in relations between Beijing and the Vatican. There are an estimated 10 million Catholics in China, divided between a government-run association whose clergy are approved by the Communist Party, and the unofficial church which answers to the Vatican. An agreement struck in September on the appointment of bishops has paved the way for a rapprochement between China and the Holy See, which cut off diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1951. Zhuang Jianjian, bishop of the Shantou diocese in southern China will retire and be replaced by Huang Bingzhang, deputy chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the Global Times reported. The Vatican-issued mandate was given to Huang last week by a delegation from Rome that met several Chinese bishops, the state-linked paper reported. ""The mission now is to unite Catholics in the diocese and reduce divergence so as to achieve the common goal of better serving church members,"" Huang told the Global Times. ""This doesn't come as a surprise because Zhuang Jianjian is already 88, so he would have wanted to retire more than a decade ago,"" said Anthony Lam, a Chinese Catholic church expert at Hong Kong's Holy Spirit Study Centre. According to canon laws that govern the Catholic church, bishops ""are requested"" to submit their resignation at the age of 75. The Catholic pope can either approve the resignation or request that they wait for a suitable successor to emerge, Lam said. ""The agreement between China and the Vatican has solved this problem because the seven bishops previously excommunicated have been restored to the church, so Huang Bingzhang will be able to take up the position."" The Vatican excommunicated Huang in 2011 for being ordained as a bishop without papal approval. This is a slightly different situation from that of fellow underground bishop Guo Xijin, who was last week asked to step aside in the eastern Fujian province to make way for government-approved clergy, Lam noted. Guo instead will serve as ""auxiliary bishop"" – someone who assists and works alongside the diocesan bishop – while both the unofficial and official churches of the diocese will merge. Guo's case was at the centre of last week's negotiations between China and the Vatican, which have been asking him to leave his post since 2017 to allow for talks aimed at ending their decades-old spat. Separately, the official church said it is facing a lack of bishops and called for ""politically reliable"" clergymen with ""good ethics,"" the Global Times reported on Wednesday. Nearly half of China's 98 Catholic dioceses have no leaders, chairman of the China Bishops Conference Ma Yinglin told a seminar, according to the paper."

A hijacker carrying a knife had been detained and was being investigated by local police, state television CGTN reported. A video posted by Duowei news, a Chinese media outlet based in the US, showed several injured people lying on the street near a crashed bus.  It also showed police wrestling a person to the ground. Blood could also be seen on the steps of the bus, which had been stopped in the middle of a road. State-run news agency Xinhua reported the suspect was a 48-year-old local man surnamed Qiu. He had attacked a female passenger before taking control of the bus, Duowei reported. Police said that on the day of the attack the suspect had quarrelled with a local official who had visited his home, adding that the pair had a long history of conflict, according to the Xinhua report. The 22 wounded in the attack were taken to local hospitals, with one person being treated for ""serious injures"", Xinhua said. Spate of attacks China has suffered a spate of similar incidents this year. In late November, a car ploughed into a group of children crossing a street in front of an elementary school in the northeastern Liaoning province, killing five people and injuring at least 19. The driver said he ""chose his victims at random"" and had reportedly been contemplating suicide due to domestic troubles before the tragedy occurred. In October, three people were killed when a man fleeing after committing a stabbing drove into a crowd and attacked onlookers in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The month before, a man ploughed a truck into a crowd in Hunan province and went on a rampage, attacking onlookers with knives and a shovel. Eleven died and 44 were injured. Grisly car accidents are common in China, where transportation authorities have struggled to uphold safety regulations – which are often flouted or go unenforced. According to authorities 58,000 people were killed in accidents across the country in 2015 alone. Last month, at least 13 people died when a bus plunged off a bridge in Chongqing municipality, after the driver got into a fist fight with a passenger who had missed her bus stop. Search and rescue teams dispatched more than 70 boats, as well as a team of scuba divers and underwater robots, to find the wreckage and retrieve bodies from the water."

international attention with his explosive claims about the
leadership of the ruling Communist Party. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court said in a statement
on its website that it had reached the verdict on the grounds
that Ma had taken a ""particularly enormous"" amount of bribes,
and that his collaboration with Guo's company were ""particularly
serious"". Ma had used his position to conspire with Guo and to help
businesses Guo controlled by using threats to bring about
illegal transactions such as compelling individuals to transfer
company shares, the court said. Ma had received more than $14.56 million (100 million yuan)
in property for his work and earned nearly 5 million yuan from
trading stocks based on insider information, the court said. Ma said that he accepted the ruling and would not appeal,
according to the court said. It was not possible to contact Ma for comment. Guo could not
immediately be reached for comment. Ma was put under investigation for corruption in 2015 and
expelled from the Communist Party the following year after
prosecutors accused him of interfering in unspecified law
enforcement activities. Dozens of senior officials have been investigated or jailed
since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, vowing to root
out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the
Communist Party’s grip on power. The powerful state security ministry spies on its citizens
and foreigners domestically and internationally. It is one of
the most opaque agencies in China and does not have a public
website or spokesman.

As a partial shutdown of the US government entered its eighth day, with no quick end in sight, the Republican president was in Washington, sending out tweets attacking Democrats and talking up possibly improved relations with China. The two nations have been in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies has been disrupted by tariffs. Trump and Xi agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war, deciding to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting December 1 while they negotiate a deal to end the dispute following months of escalating tensions. Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! Chinese state media also said Xi and Trump spoke on Saturday and quoted Xi as saying that teams from both countries have been working to implement a consensus reached with Trump. ""I hope that the two teams will meet each other halfway, work hard, and strive to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial and beneficial to the world as soon as possible,"" Xi said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The leaders of both the United States and China want ""stable progress"" in ties, Xi said during the call. ""China attaches great importance to the development of bilateral relations and appreciates the willingness of the US side to develop cooperative and constructive bilateral relations."" Billions of dollars of losses  The US-China trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018, hitting industries including automobiles, technology - and above all, agriculture. The losses may give US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, motivation to resolve their trade differences before a March 2 deadline, although talks between the economic superpowers could still devolve."

February 15, 2019. China's economy czar is heading to Washington for talks on Thursday and Friday aimed at ending a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions ahead of a deadline for a massive US tariff hike. The announcement on Tuesday via the official Xinhua News Agency follows talks last week in Beijing that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said ""made headway"" on key issues. Xinhua said Vice Premier Liu He will hold talks with Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. A lower-level round of talks between the US and China will take place in Washington on Tuesday, the White House said on Monday. The talks follow a round of negotiations that ended in Beijing last week without a deal but which officials said had generated progress on contentious issues between the world's two largest economies. The talks are aimed at ""achieving needed structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China. The two sides will also discuss China's pledge to purchase a substantial amount of goods and services from the United States,"" the White House said in a statement. Both governments have expressed optimism but they have given no details of their talks. Economists say the time available for negotiations is too brief to resolve an array of irritants in US-Chinese relations. They say Beijing's goal is to persuade President Donald Trump they are making enough progress to push back threatened US penalties. Beijing hopes for ""a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement that is acceptable to both sides,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. The talks on Thursday will be led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a strong proponent of pressing China to end practices that the US says include forced technology transfers from US companies and intellectual property theft. The White House said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and trade adviser Peter Navarro would also take part in the talks. US tariffs on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1. Trump, who suggested last week that he could extend the deadline for the talks, reiterated in a speech on Monday that the negotiations had been fruitful. ""We're making a lot of progress.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/slowly-but-surely-china-is-moving-into-afghanistan-12715872,"Slowly but surely, China is moving into Afghanistan","As the war in Afghanistan winds down, China looks to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.",6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"As the war in Afghanistan winds down, China looks to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.  In 2013, Chinese president Xi Jinping inaugurated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vast network of infrastructure projects spanning more than 60 countries. But the BRI largely excludes Afghanistan, moving through Central Asia and Pakistan instead. That may now be changing. China has steadily increased its involvement in Afghanistan in recent years, and a nascent peace process offers some hope that stability might return to the country, bringing with it the possibility of greater trade and investment. This shift is reflected in a major new report on the BRI’s expansion into Afghanistan by the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies (DROPS), a Kabul-based think tank. The 15-month research project has amassed a vast amount of material gleaned from multiple sources, including previously undisclosed government documents and interviews with high-ranking Afghan officials, making it by far the most comprehensive treatment of Afghanistan’s potential role in the BRI to date. “Looking at the BRI map, it seemed that it was bypassing Afghanistan,” said Mariam Safi, Director of DROPS and one of the report’s co-authors. “So, we wanted to know if there is any thinking in the Afghan government and stakeholders here on the BRI when it comes to Afghanistan’s potential linkage”. Afghanistan should fit well into the BRI. It has a serious infrastructure deficit, making it an ideal candidate for Chinese investment. It is also the shortest route between Central Asia and South Asia, and between China and the Middle East, while also serving as a gateway to the Arabian Sea. But China’s role in Afghanistan in the past two decades has been limited. It did not contribute troops to the US-led war that began in 2001, and Beijing has so far refrained from the sorts of big-ticket investments planned for other neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Kazakhstan. But its economic footprint has expanded. China is now Afghanistan’s largest business investor, it has pledged increasing amounts of aid to the country, and Chinese companies have been involved in construction projects. Beijing has also shown some interest in Afghanistan’s cornucopia of natural resources, which includes vast deposits of essential minerals such as lithium (used in mobile phone batteries). The country’s weak logistics and security situation make it difficult to extract and transport these resources. But China has got its foot in the door, winning rights to Amu Darya Basin oil in the north and the massive Mes Aynak copper mine near Kabul. Moreover, Beijing has taken modest steps to include Afghanistan in the BRI. In 2016 Beijing and Kabul signed a Memorandum of Understanding. China has reportedly pledged at least $100 million in funding. However, this is a tiny amount compared to the vast sums proposed for other countries, like Pakistan. And, according to Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), “We still don’t see large projects going forward that quickly on the ground.” But there has been some progress. In September 2016, for example, the first direct freight train from China reached the Afghan border town of Hairatan. An air corridor linking Kabul and the Chinese city of Urumqi has also been launched under the BRI. Then, in May 2017, Afghan officials attended the massive Belt and Road Forum in China, and in October Afghanistan joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which funds BRI projects. Kabul has made connectivity a key pillar of its foreign policy, launching various infrastructure projects that could eventually be “brought under the BRI fold,” Mariam Safi tells TRT World. Reluctant bedfellows  One such initiative is the Five Nations Railway running from China to Iran via Afghanistan, which is still at the feasibility study stage but aligns well with Beijing’s priorities in the Belt and Road. Another is a planned north-south railway corridor that would connect Kunduz with Torkham on the Pakistani border. Afghanistan has bold plans to expand its almost non-existent railway network. According to internal Afghan government documents reviewed by DROPS, China has pledged “huge support” for these efforts. The north-south railway could facilitate the transport of natural resources while also connecting to Pakistan.  Furthermore, there are various energy projects which could fit well into the Belt and Road vision, such as CASA-1000 and TAP-500 that would export surplus electricity from Central Asia to energy-starved South Asia via Afghanistan, or the TAPI gas pipeline, whose Afghan segment began construction last year (although there is reason to doubt its progress). Another project that could be included in BRI is the Digital Silk Road fibre optic cable network, funded by China, the US and other partners, which has already connected at least 25 provinces in Afghanistan while aiming to link to China, South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, according to DROPS. China has generally eschewed a leadership role in Afghanistan, preferring to work with foreign partners. Some projects, including the Five Nations Railway and Lapis Lazuli Corridor, are jointly financed by China and multilateral lending institutions such as the ADB. “There has been a lot of cooperative activity on the ground,” Raffaello Pantucci told TRT World, and Beijing seems to view Afghanistan as a place where it can “test out” difficult relationships. China has collaborated with the US there, despite tensions between the two countries, and recently agreed to cooperate with its rival, India. Sino-Indian efforts in Afghanistan face a hurdle, though, in the form of Beijing’s close relationship with Delhi’s nemesis, Pakistan. 2015 saw the inauguration of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a vast energy and infrastructure project involving more than $60 billion of potential investment. CPEC was intended to be the Belt and Road’s “flagship” corridor, and, as such, it is already more advanced than other components of the BRI. According to the report, CPEC is “one of the most feasible options” for integrating Afghanistan into the BRI. There are some cross-border rail and road links at varying stages of development. While none of these is near completion, China clearly wants to move forward. In 2017 Beijing convened a trilateral dialogue with Pakistan and Afghanistan partly to discuss extending CPEC, but also to ameliorate the rocky relationship between its two neighbours, which has seen border closures and skirmishes. These efforts paid off, as Afghan-Pakistani relations improved in 2018, with a new cooperation agreement in May. Afghan officials interviewed by DROPS were generally “positive” about CPEC, the report says, but some were wary of excessive dependence on Pakistan. Indeed, as relations with Islamabad soured in recent years, Kabul has diversified its trade away from Pakistan to Iran. However, the officials were clear “across the board” that Afghanistan still needs Pakistan because it provides the quickest route to the sea, according to Mariam Safi. And, vice versa, Pakistan hopes that Afghanistan may eventually provide access to Central Asian markets. “At the end of the day there was the realisation that both countries need each other,” Safi told TRT World. Neither the Afghan nor Pakistani governments responded to requests for comment. Increasing Chinese footprint While China’s economic role in Afghanistan has increased, its security presence has grown even more. As the US started withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in 2011, the country became increasingly unstable, raising the risk that insecurity would spill out into Central Asia and Pakistan, potentially disrupting China’s Belt and Road projects there. Beijing has also been concerned about what they call the threat posed by Uighur and other terrorists using Afghanistan as a base for attacks against the Chinese mainland. In response, China has intensified security on its border, reportedly engaging in joint patrols with Afghan forces and building a base in Badakhshan province, while also launching the Quadrilateral Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism (QCCM) with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan. To counter instability in Afghanistan, China has also stepped up its involvement in peace talks to end the war. Since 2015, it has been involved in a number of multilateral initiatives, including the Quadrilateral Coordination Group and, more recently, the Moscow Format. Beijing has cultivated good ties with the Taliban, meeting them several times in 2018 alone. Peace may now be on the horizon. The Trump administration has made unprecedented progress in its efforts to negotiate with the Taliban, reaching a provisional agreement in January. The Afghan government still needs to join the talks, however, and there is a long road ahead. For Beijing, peace would not only reduce the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan, but it could also boost Chinese economic activity. “Afghanistan has been peripheral to the Belt and Road because it simply hasn’t been possible to pursue a serious economic agenda there,” said Andrew Small, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the US and author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics. “If there is a political settlement, that could change – though China will still tread very carefully until it’s clear that any settlement holds.” At the launch of the DROPS report in January, Beijing’s new ambassador to Kabul, Liu Jinsong, said that China was facilitating peace talks to enable Afghanistan’s integration into the BRI, describing the country as a “vital partner” in the initiative. The appointment of Mr Jinsong, a former director of the Silk Road Fund, “shows that Beijing now considers Afghanistan a priority and wants to include it firmly in its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),” according to the Berlin-based thinktank, MERICS. While there is still a long way to go, Beijing is entering a new phase of engagement with its neighbour. “It is certainly true that China is playing a much greater (and higher profile) role in Afghanistan,” said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at the University of Oxford, whose latest book, The New Silk Roads, examines emerging forms of connectivity in Asia. “My best guess is that this really is a case of a new page being turned,” Frankopan told TRT World. The Chinese embassy in Kabul could not be reached for comment. Asked to comment on CPEC’s possible extension to Afghanistan, China’s deputy chief of mission in Islamabad, Zhao Lijian, referred TRT World to a recent interview in which he described Chinese plans to facilitate trade and ease tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan."

Taiwan will not accept any deal that destroys its sovereignty and democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday after the island's opposition KMT party said it could sign a peace deal with China if it wins a presidential election next year. China claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island, which it regards as sacred territory, under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. While China has not broached the idea of a peace deal in years, the chairman of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), Wu Den-yih, said last week the party could sign a peace deal with China if it won the hotly contested election. ""Taiwan society will not accept any treaty that harms Taiwan's national sovereignty and democracy,"" Tsai told reporters in Taipei. She said there won't be real peace unless China rules out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing was expected to make fresh overtures to the KMT ahead of the elections, security sources in Taiwan's government familiar with the matter told Reuters, a move they said could isolate Tsai's government and sway the election results. Losing out in polls Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party suffered stinging losses to the KMT in mayoral and local elections in November. Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo, has said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect Taipei's democratic values. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies. Tsai has repeatedly called for international support to defend Taiwan's democracy and way of life in the face of China's renewed threats. "

In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before proceeding to their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Friday, February 22, 2019. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented a $10 billion deal for a refining and petrochemical complex in China on Friday, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping who urged joint efforts to counter extremism and terror. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, arrived on Thursday on an Asia tour that has already seen the kingdom pledged investment of $20 billion in Pakistan and seek to make additional investments in India's refining industry. ""China is a good friend and partner to Saudi Arabia,"" President Xi Jinping told the crown prince in front of reporters. ""The special nature of our bilateral relationship reflects the efforts you have made,"" added Xi, who has made stepping up China's presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia's relations with China dated back ""a very long time in the past."" ""In the hundreds, even thousands, of years, the interactions between the sides have been friendly. Over such a long period of exchanges with China, we have never experienced any problems with China,"" he said. Crown Prince Mohammed, who has come under fire in the West following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October, said Saudi Arabia saw great opportunities with China. ""The Silk Road initiative and China's strategic orientation are very much in line with the kingdom's Vision 2030,"" he said according to SPA, referring to Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform programme. Trade between the countries increased by 32 percent last year, he said. Saudi Arabia also said it was working to add Chinese to the curriculum in Saudi schools and universities. ""The introduction of Chinese to the curriculum is an important step towards the opening of new horizons for students,"" the government said in a statement. China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh, since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi Arabia's regional foe, Iran. China is also wary of criticism from Muslim countries about its camps in the heavily Muslim far western region of Xinjiang, which the government says are for de-radicalisation purposes and rights groups call internment camps. Xi told the crown prince the two countries must strengthen international cooperation on de-radicalisation to ""prevent the infiltration and spread of extremist thinking,"" Chinese state TV reported. Saudi Arabia respected and supported China's right to protect its own security and take counterterror and de-radicalisation steps, the crown prince told Xi, according to the same report, and was willing to increase cooperation. Meeting the crown prince earlier on Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said the two countries should enhance exchanges on their experiences in de-radicalisation, China's official Xinhua news agency said in a separate report. Chinese state media made no direct mention of Xinjiang in their stories on the crown prince's meetings. Deals signed Aramco agreed to form a joint venture with Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in the northeastern Chinese city of Panjin, saying the project was worth more than $10 billion. The partners would form a company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Co as part of a project that would include a 300,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery with a 1.5-million-metric tonnes per year ethylene cracker, Aramco said. Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the crude feedstock for the complex, which is expected to start operations in 2024. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, a position Russia has held for the last three years. Saudi Aramco is set to boost market share by signing supply deals with non-state Chinese refiners. Aramco also signed an agreement to buy a nine percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, Saudi state news agency SPA said . This formalised a previously announced plan to gain a stake in a 400,000-bpd refinery and petrochemicals complex in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai. China sees ""enormous potential"" in Saudi Arabia's economy and wants more high-tech cooperation, State Councillor Wang Yi, the Chinese government's top diplomat, said on Thursday. But China was not seeking to play politics in the Middle East, the widely read state-run tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial. ""China won't be a geopolitical player in the Middle East.

Flags fly as members of Egyptian security forces stand guard before the start of a summit between Arab league and European Union member states, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, February 24, 2019. Leaders from European Union and Arab League countries pledged on Sunday to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to tackle unauthorised migration at a first-ever summit high in symbolism but likely to yield few concrete results. Under tight security at the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi opened two days of talks with a speech celebrating what he described as historic cooperation between the two organizations. But despite the public display of unity, just drafting a summit statement has proved difficult.  EU and Arab League foreign ministers failed to agree earlier this month on a text after Hungary objected to the section on migration. Europe's migration challenge is at the heart of the two-day meeting, being held under the slogan ""Investing in Stability.""  Desperate to bring migrant arrivals under control, the EU offered the summit last October as a symbolic sweetener to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi. What EU wants from Sisi The EU wants Sisi to order the Egyptian coast guard to pick up migrants leaving Libya and take them back to the African mainland, ensuring they do not become Europe's responsibility. Sissi, in turn, receives high-profile European recognition, promotion for Sharm el Sheikh, and is likely to avoid any lessons on human rights. While the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean has now dropped to a seven-year low, Europe's inability to agree on how to manage the arrivals has sparked a major political crisis, as nations bicker over who should take responsibility and whether other EU partners should help out.  Some, like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary, claim that extremists are entering among the refugees. Praises for Egypt  Just days before the summit, the head of the EU's border and coast guard agency praised the authorities in Cairo for preventing any migrant from setting out for Europe from the Egyptian coast since 2016. ""There are no boats coming directly from Egypt to the European Union,"" Frontex director Fabrice Leggeri said. ""The cooperation with Egypt is really encouraging and is developing."" The EU routinely trumpets an agreement it reached with Turkey for slowing migrant arrivals to a trickle in exchange for up to 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in aid for Syrian refugees there and other incentives. It has pledged to replicate the deal in northern Africa. Ahead of this inaugural summit, experts and European officials played down any expectation of major results. Important timing ""The timing is very important because it comes after eight years of instability in the Mediterranean affecting Europe and the Middle East,"" Saeed Sadek, professor of political sociology at the Canadian University in Cairo told The Associated Press. ""Both sides want to know how can we stabilise the area further, produce stability, how can we deal with the consequences and prevent any further escalations,"" said Sadek. ""But the imbalance of power between the two sides may not produce the concrete results that people imagine."" May to seek Saudi influence in Yemen British Prime Minister Theresa May will call on Saudi Arabia's King Salman to use his influence to encourage Yemeni parties towards peace, telling a summit that governments must redouble efforts to secure a political settlement to the crisis. ""My message in Sharm el Sheikh is clear: let us now redouble our efforts to build on the progress made and get the Stockholm agreements implemented in full,"" May said on the way to the EU-League of Arab states summit in Egypt. ""I will also use this summit to reiterate to King Salman the importance of Saudi Arabia continuing to use their influence to encourage the Yemeni parties towards peace, as they did so pivotally in Stockholm. And I will underline the UK's ongoing commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia and the region."" The war in Yemen has largely been stalemated for years, with a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states and Yemeni allies unable to dislodge the Houthi movement that controls the capital and most major population centres. A ceasefire was agreed at talks at a castle near Stockholm last month.  The agreement also foresees a political track of talks to end the war. But a lack of progress could test the patience of the United Arab Emirates, which leads military operations on Yemen's Red Sea coast for the Saudi-led coalition"

Trump tweeted that there had been ""productive talks,"" adding that ""I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1.""

Trump said that if negotiations progress, he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida resort to finalise an agreement. Speaking to governors gathered at the White House for an annual black-tie ball on Sunday, Trump said he was doing ""very well"" with China. ""If all works well we're going to have some very big news over the next week or two,"" he said, though he took care to add that ""we still have a little ways to go."" The reprieve is likely to be greeted with relief by financial markets. US and Chinese negotiators met through the weekend as they seek to resolve a trade war that has rattled financial markets. Trump had warned he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on $200 billion in Chinese imports, from 10 to 25 percent, if the two sides failed to reach a deal. The increase was scheduled to take effect at 12:01 am EST (05:01 GMT) on March 2. Kate Fisher has more from Washington DC. Mounting pressure The world's two biggest economies have been locked in a conflict over US allegations that China steals technology and forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in an aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance. The two counties have slapped import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods. The conflict has shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy, putting pressure on Trump and Xi to reach a deal. ""Trump clearly wants a deal and so do the Chinese, which certainly raises the probability that the two sides will come to some sort of negotiated agreement, even if it is a partial one, in the coming weeks,"" said Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. But business groups and lawmakers in Congress want to see a comprehensive deal that forces the Chinese to change their behaviour and can be enforced."

Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation.

""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest. (Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-un firm backing in deadlocked nuclear talks with the United States, insisting the two sides should meet ""halfway"", Chinese state media said on Thursday. Kim visited Beijing this week for two days of talks that reasserted China's role in the process, and were seen as a strategy session ahead of an expected second summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump. At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

Three days of US-Chinese talks aimed at ending a costly tariff battle wrapped up Wednesday in an optimistic atmosphere after President Donald Trump said they were ""going very well!"" No details were immediately announced, but Asian stock markets rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday on an unannounced visit for talks with President Xi Jinping, as preparations ramp up for an expected second summit with Donald Trump. South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. A motorcade was seen leaving a Beijing train station, with police blocking a street with metal gates hours after Kim's train crossed the border into northern China, according to AFP journalists. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Hong Kong for more. Last year, Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the US and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that US State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The US State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. ""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. ""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."" At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea's foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks."""

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits. Among the civil servants staying in the homes of Uighur families, it was reported that there were public officials from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region armed forces, the Armed Police Units and the Chinese central government's representatives. The report also suggested that last year in Xinjiang, encouraged by the officials of the ""National Union and Family"" activities deepened the national unity, strengthening the links between the party officials and the local people, ""the CCP's voice was heard by thousands of families,"" the report added. An official speaking to the paper said, ""The villagers are eagerly looking forward to a modern lifestyle and understanding the good policies of the party. Nowadays, the relationship between the party and the people is rapidly developing. The villagers are ... embracing the modern civilization movement. Their lifestyle has changed and so has their thoughts."" Uighur representatives living outside of China have reacted harshly to the practice, saying officials staying at the houses on behalf of the communist party are actually there to spy on the families. Responding to the allegations, China has strongly refuted any suggestion that it is mistreating the Uighur minority. Previously, Hu Lianhe, a spokesman for China's United Front Work Department, had told a UN panel. ""There is no arbitrary detention or lack of freedom of religion and belief."" ""Xinjiang citizens including the Uighurs enjoy equal freedoms and rights."" Hu said, ""there is no such thing as re-education centres,"" but added criminals convicted of ""minor offences"" have been assigned to ""vocational educational and employment training centres with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation."" ""They are not subject to any arbitrary detention or ill-treatment there,"" Hu added."

People demonstrate against China in front of the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland, on November 6, 2018. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman slammed Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, saying it is a ""great embarrassment"" in a written statement on Sunday. Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.  The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a Chinese state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.  ""China, show us their videos if they are alive!"" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter.  He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.  No camps China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated one million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. The country has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and UN rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who live predominantly in a region claimed by Uighurs in China, which they call East Turkistan and is home to some 10 million people, most of whom are Muslim. Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centres where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education.  Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism. Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity.""  Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the ""concentration camps"" and ""systematic assimilation"" to which Muslims in Xinjiang are subject. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement ""a very bad mistake."" Heyit under investigation Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an ""absurd lie.""  She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security. The video shows Heyit in a grey sweater against a nondescript, grey wall. He states his name and gives the date as February 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused. The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed. Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive. The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result, many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media.  On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings. If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

US President Donald Trump, left, gestures as he and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida in this file photo. (April 7, 2017) As leaders of the world's top economic powers seek to defuse tension over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, they will search for common ground on reforms to end a crisis at the institution that was created to prevent economic disputes escalating into war. The World Trade Organization is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional, just when it is most needed to fulfil its role as umpire in trade disputes and as the watchdog of global commerce. ""If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said last week. ""The WTO is doing all it can to support efforts to de-escalate the situation, but finding solutions will require political will and it will require leadership from the G20."" Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing on the effects the US-China trade war has on Chinese exporters.  The WTO has fallen victim to Trump's trade war on economic rival China and the United States has put pressure on the WTO itself to reform. Trump is unhappy with the WTO's failure to hold Beijing to account for failing to open its economy as envisioned when China joined the WTO in 2001. To force reform at the WTO, Trump's team has blocked new appointments to the world's top trade court, the WTO's Appellate Body which is now rapidly running out of judges, meaning it will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. If there are not enough judges, ""disputes go into limbo,"" former Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman said. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States earlier this year. Those, and his tariffs on Chinese imports, have drawn retaliatory tariffs, and represent the kind of dispute the WTO was created to help resolve. Numerous countries have filed litigation at the WTO to contest the tariffs. But if the WTO is unable to rule on them, Trump's aggressive policies cannot be deemed to be illegal and could continue with impunity. The US government has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to force concessions that would change the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. Chinese and US officials negotiating easing the trade tensions were making progress on Friday at a Group of 20 summit in Argentina, a Chinese official said. Court with no judges The US metals tariffs have caused a storm because they are based on what Washington says are national security concerns, which makes them exempt from WTO rules. But other countries dispute the link to national security, and are challenging it at the WTO. They fear Trump could use the same reasoning to put import tariffs on cars and other goods. Time is running out because the Appellate Body now has the minimum three members it needs to function and from December 2019 it will be down to one, so only appeals that get underway by that date have a prospect of being resolved. There is a big backlog of cases going through the WTO dispute settlement process, so the metals tariffs are unlikely to be ruled on and appealed within that time frame. ""The new cases of the US duties on steel and aluminium will not be decided... they will not finish before (the end of) 2019,"" former Appellate Body member Giorgio Sacerdoti said. Another major dispute at the WTO concerns the refusal by the European Union and the United States to recognise China as a ""market economy"" whose goods are fairly priced by the market. They say the Chinese state's involvement in the economy has created a steel and aluminium supply glut. China is pursuing legal action against the EU. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said a ruling in China's favour ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO"". That case is also bogged down. Even if the appeal lands in time, there is another potential hitch. The Appellate Body's Chinese member, Hong Zhao, may have to recuse herself because of a potential conflict of interest, which would make it impossible to decide on any appeal in the case, several trade experts told Reuters. ""It’s a very difficult situation for her,"" one diplomat said. Chinese, US, EU and WTO officials declined to comment on whether or not Zhao would need to be recused."

People walk under an electronic board showing stock information at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Lujiazui Financial Area before the visit of Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in Shanghai, China, September 22, 2015 Chinese shares, commodities and the yuan currency jumped on Monday after Chinese and US leaders agreed to a temporary truce in their bitter trade war, but the longer-term outlook for trade relations remains murky. The deal between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping postponed the most pressing threat to the global and Chinese economies - a sharp hike in US tariffs that had been slated for January 1. But analysts cautioned it has only bought a bit more time for wrangling over deeply divisive trade and policy differences, and said China's economy will continue to cool regardless under the weight of weakening domestic demand. Still, the news offered some relief for the country's battered stock markets, which had tumbled over 20 percent at one point this year, prompting a flurry of support measures. At the midday break, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index was 2.9 percent higher and blue-chip shares surged 3.1 percent. Government bond futures fell as shares rallied, with the 10-year treasury futures for March delivery, the most-traded contract, falling 0.26 percent at the open. It was last down 0.07 percent at 96.630. Shares in Hong Kong also jumped, with the Hang Seng index adding 2.7 percent at midday, and breaking through the 27,000 level for the first time since October 4. The China Enterprises Index is 2.8 percent higher at midday. ""This is a relief rally. The markets are oversold. I don't think we needed much of an excuse (for a rebound),"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The agreement ""is not a ceasefire, it's just a de-escalation. The existing tariffs are still having a negative impact on the Chinese economy, they haven't gone away."" The White House said Beijing had agreed to buy an unspecified but ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. It said the two sides would launch new talks to address issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and non-tariff barriers. But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. China praised the ""important consensus"" reached in the deal, but did not mention the 90-day deadline. Despite the differences in the wording and uncertainty about some details, the agreement was a better outcome than investors had expected, said Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities in Shanghai. At the same time, the outcome of the meeting is ""unlikely to immediately spark a turnaround in market sentiment,"" he said. ""While this means the effect of the trade war may pause for a moment, we're still facing domestic issues including slowing growth, and awaiting more information about the direction of macroeconomic policy and eagerly expected measures like tax cuts."" In onshore trade, the yuan was trading at 6.9174 per dollar at midday, after opening at 6.9278. It has lost more than 6 percent of its value so far this year as trade ties deteriorated and the US dollar firmed. The offshore yuan firmed to as high as 6.8950, and was trading at 6.9110 at midday. ""The impact on the yuan was very positive, and has prompted many market participants building up long positions in the Chinese unit,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. ""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment."" Ken Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, was less optimistic. ""The gap between China and the US ... remains quite wide, and it is very difficult for them to reach a comprehensive deal in 90 days,"" Cheung said, adding that he doesn't see ""much further movement"" for the rebound. Commodities also rallied on hopes of thawing relations. Prices of Chinese steel products and steelmaking ingredients soared more than 6 percent. ""We are expecting China to buy more LNG, LPG, corn and soybean to step up imports from US,"" said Michael Mao, energy analyst with consultancyChina Sublime Information Group. ""(The) government is also likely to issue a new import tax on these products to facilitate imports."" But some analysts cautioned about reading too much into Monday's rally. ""The fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, referring to the day's gains. ""Worries about the trade war have subsided, so investors are shifting their focus back to other things, like a stronger renminbi (or) a lower pace of rate hikes from the Fed."" China's factory activity grew slightly in November, a private survey showed on Monday, but new export orders shrank at a faster pace and manufacturers reported they were cutting prices amid soft domestic demand. The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November which showed growth in the nation's vast factory sector had effectively stalled."

a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions. The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei. China summons US envoy to protest detention China summoned the US ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Meng's detention. The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng ""lodged solemn representations and strong protests"" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention. The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention ""extremely egregious"" and demanded the US vacate an order for her arrest.  It quoted Le as calling for the US to ""immediately correct its wrong actions"" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges
of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a
Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30
years for each charge. No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after
nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the
hearing was adjourned until Monday. In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to
release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to
lodge a ""strong protest."" Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond

arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship
with Beijing. Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States
while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach
of her lawful rights, Le said. The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its
very nature ""extremely nasty,"" he added. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately
release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful,
legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full
responsibility for the serious consequences caused."" The statement did not elaborate. ""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in
high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former
Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday. ""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice
box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that.
That's the price of dealing with a country like China."" Meng's arrest was on the same day that US President Donald
Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways
to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two
largest economies. “We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you
to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,” said a
US State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The news of Meng's arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn
condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his
top economic advisers have played down its importance to trade
talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce. A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has ""every

Iran may yet survive.,6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"The EU along with Russia and China have opposed the Trump administration on trashing the Iran nuclear deal. Iran may yet survive.  As the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, sanctions were imposed on Tehran. The second phase, which was announced on November 5, was described as some of the most stringent sanctions ever by Trump. This new wave of coercive measures targets critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as energy, shipping and shipbuilding and the financial sectors. Punitive measures are nothing new to the Islamic Republic. The country has been under sanctions by the US for almost 40 years. The Iranian authorities claim they developed the resilience needed to deal with sanctions no matter how tough they are. In this context, President Hassan Rouhani stated: “We will proudly break these illegal, unjust sanctions.” The US often resorts to coercive economic measures as part of its diplomatic pressure on states that do not align with Washington's foreign policy objectives. Such policies are not only meant to show the economic strength and overall dominance of the US as a superpower, but they also intend to provoke uprisings in the poverty-stricken populace. However, there is a gap between theory and practice, and many experts believe that these policies do not break the grip of regimes in power, as seen in the cases of Venezuela, Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea. The more recent sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been entirely futile. Sanctions only harmed the poor people of these countries rather than bringing policy changes by their respective governments, just because the regimes’ ‘centres of gravity’ are usually shielded from the effect of the sanctions. Also, the sanctioned states become a lot more aggressive and use repressive means that thwart any uprising plans. Besides, economic strictures are counter-productive. Iran has lived under different boycotts, and its regime built its political legitimacy on anti-American rhetoric. The authorities will merely use this new wave of sanctions to unite the people under its leadership further. In fact, huge demonstrations already took place on November 4 to protest against the US policies. Despite claims to the contrary, the first affected will be the low-income population and the working class as they are not capable of dealing with the expected impact of the US-imposed measures. The middle class will also have trouble with sanctions due to high inflation rates which will deplete the purchasing power for all Iranians. While Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions will not involve food, medicine and basic humanitarian goods, US measures have already restricted the transfer of money which affects the importation of food and medicine. The price for medication, such as the one needed for cancer treatment, has become exorbitant. Additionally, Iranians living abroad will also be heavily impacted because of the restrictions on Iran's banking system. SWIFT, the international system for money transfer, removed its access to the Central Bank of Iran. Consequently, countless Iranian students may not be able to receive money transfers from Iran. Interestingly, the US exempted eight countries from sanctions on importing Iranian oil for six months, so they can still do business with Iran. Some observers considered such a step indicates which nations are being treated favourably by Trump. Others estimate that this exemption demonstrates the failure of this policy, which was imposed unilaterally and could not get support from Europe and other countries. Iran has emerged cleared of any wrongdoing in this particular case. Tehran has been committed to the nuclear agreement and has respected its part of the deal. The US, on the other hand, seems to be in breach of international law. Besides, by moving against Tehran unilaterally, the White House is damaging its transatlantic relations and undermining its allies. Consequently, the Trump administration has not won the battle for world public opinion given that it pursues a bellicose course of action without any valid reasons. In the foreseeable future, the United States is not likely to remove sanctions or change course in its approach vis-à-vis Iran. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic will adapt to the new situation by finding ways to export its oil and gas via different routes. The Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his confidence that the Iranian oil industry would find markets. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.” Geopolitically, Tehran will seek - more than ever - to damage US client states in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia. The latter has been considerably weakened by its ill-conceived war in Yemen and the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Also, it is predicted that Tehran will get closer to Moscow and cement their strategic relationships. Finally, Tehran will enhance its relations with neighbouring countries, which provide a crucial lifeline for Iran’s economy. These measures mean that Trump’s approach is not only doomed to fail but it also does not serve the purpose for which it was initially intended.      "

Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed early this month to a 90-day truce in the trade dispute, which halted the threatened escalation of punitive tariffs while the two sides continue negotiations.

Previously, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained. The detentions came after Canadian police arrested Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a regular news conference in Beijing, China on January 6, 2016. A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, a Canadian newspaper reported on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese telecoms executive. Canada's foreign ministry said it was ""aware of a Canadian citizen"" having been detained, according to the National Post, which cited a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson did not provide further details and did not suggest that the detention was linked to the arrest on December 1 of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the report said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that she had ""not heard"" about the reported detention. The recent detention of two Canadians has raised questions whether Beijing is holding them in retaliation for Meng's arrest, though no link has officially been made between the cases. Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings Huawei is alleged to have had with Iran. National security concerns  China has accused the other detainees – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor – of activities ""that endanger China's national security."" They were both detained on December 10. Kovrig is a Hong Kong-based senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, while Spavor facilitates trips to North Korea and helped former NBA star Dennis Rodman travel to the neighbouring country. Beijing has threatened Canada with ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not freed and Chinese state-run media have criticised the arrest, saying it was politically motivated. Ottawa has repeatedly said the arrest was not political but rather a judicial process in keeping with an extradition treaty Ottawa has with Washington. But despite escalating tensions between the two countries, the Canadian embassy in China does not seem to be holding back. On Tuesday it posted a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Charter 08, a widely circulated online petition that called for political reform in China, on Chinese social media. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died last year from liver cancer while in police custody, was arrested after co-authoring the petition, which urged protection of basic human rights and the reform of China's one-party system. "

US President Donald Trump, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, US President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018. China will roll back tariffs on US-made cars, US President Donald Trump said, unveiling another potential breakthrough in a trade war truce that cheered stock markets on Monday. Trump's surprise announcement late Sunday came a day after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to suspend any new tariffs and give negotiators 90 days to strike a deal. TRT World's Caitlin McGee reports. The ceasefire follows months of tensions and tit-for-tat custom duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods that raised fears of an escalation harmful to the global economy. Both sides gained from hitting the pause button, with Trump securing a Chinese pledge to import more US goods and Xi staving off the further pressure that higher tariffs would place on his country's slowing economy. Trump tweeted that China had agreed to ""reduce and remove"" tariffs of 40 percent on cars, though Beijing has yet to confirm the move. China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%. China's foreign ministry declined to confirm Trump's assertion on Monday, instead saying: ""On December 1 President Xi and President Trump reached an important consensus on trade issues."" ""They agreed to hold off on the imposition of new tariffs and came up with a series of constructive arrangements on how to address the existing differences and problems,"" spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. Trump's tweet did not explain which tariffs would be reduced or removed, or when China would act. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the car announcement, if confirmed, was ""certainly movement in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of more things to come"". Beijing had reduced auto import duties from 25 percent to 15 percent in July. But it later added a 25 percent tariff on US-made cars as trade tensions soared, bringing them to 40 percent. Many US automakers build their cars in China for the local market, but the tariff hikes have hit sales and profits for some companies including electric car-maker Tesla and US-made models from BMW and Ford. IP theft  One expert said China would have to address US complaints about China's forced transfer of intellectual property rights - a major issue at the core of a US ""301"" trade investigation -- for Washington to drop its tariffs. ""Any action which increases market access or better ensures a level playing field will certainly be welcomed and could lead to continued discussions,"" Steven Okun, a Singapore-based senior advisor at strategic advisory firm McLarty Associates, told AFP. ""Still, one must presume that as the existing and proposed tariffs are to spur China to address the US' IPR concerns, only action directly related to that would ultimately impact the 301 tariffs,"" he said. The White House said Saturday the two sides would ""immediately"" begin talks on ""structural changes"" affecting forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection and cyber theft. China reaffirmed that the agreement held ""great significance"". ""It prevents the economic and trade frictions from expanding and opens new prospects for cooperation,"" Geng said. 'No magic wand'  Asian and European stock markets jumped on Monday, with Hong Kong and Shanghai closing sharply higher and the yuan strengthening after months of trade-war turbulence. After being spooked by the conflict, investors returned to buying following the long-awaited meeting between the two presidents. But observers warned there were still major issues that needed to be resolved, including access for US companies and intellectual property protection. ""In order to really make a difference, China needs to enact more sweeping comprehensive reforms in the short term,"" Zarit said. China's state-run media cautiously welcomed the Buenos Aires agreement. The nationalist Global Times tabloid called it a ""momentous step forward"" that brings ""huge potential for fair trade"". ""It is hoped that the trade teams from both countries will reach as many practical agreements as possible and as quickly as possible to hasten China-US cooperation,"" the daily said. Under the agreement, Trump is shelving a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent from the start of next year - but the hike will kick in if negotiators fail to reach a final deal within 90 days. The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and they remain in effect despite the truce. China has hit back with similar tariffs on $110 billion worth of goods made in the US. ""No magic wand has been waved to make the differences between the United States and China vanish overnight,"" the state-run China Daily warned. ""Given the complexity of interactions between the two economies, the rest of the world will still be holding its collective breath while it waits to see if the series of constructive plans that are in the works can put bilateral relations back on a cooperative rather than confrontational track,"" it said."

China's President Xi Jinping listens to his Panamanian counterpart Juan Carlos Varela (not pictured) while delivering a joint message after a private meeting as part of Xi's first state visit to Panama, at Presidential Palace in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Portugal on Tuesday for a two-day visit to strengthen ties, amid concern in some EU capitals over China's growing influence on the continent. Fresh from a visit to Spain last week, his two-day stay in Portugal will include a meeting with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and the signing of cooperation agreements. One of them will bring the Portuguese port of Sines, in the southwest, into what China calls the ""new Silk Road"", an initiative that offers loans to build railways, roads and ports across Asia, Europe and Africa. In an op-ed published on Sunday in Portuguese newspapers, President Xi stressed the importance of China's relationship with Portugal as part of a broader network of trade links. But China's growing influence in Europe, welcomed by Greece and several eastern European countries, is viewed warily by others on the continent. At the initiative of France and Germany, EU countries last week agreed a framework regulating foreign investment, particularly from China. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Friday that Lisbon did not back the idea and was relieved that the final accord provided for only an advisory role on the part of the European Commission. Foreign investment does not worry Portugal, and the EU should not ""take the path of protectionism"" in the face of globalisation, he said. Portugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries, was open to Chinese investment after being hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis. Its 78 billion euro ($88 billion) EU-IMF rescue package in 2011 came with required austerity policies - and a wide-ranging privatisation programme that opened the doors to Chinese investment. Chinese investment accounted for 3.6 percent of Portugal's GDP between 2010 and 2016, according to figures from Spain's ESADE business school. China now owns a 28 percent stake in Portuguese energy utility EDP, the country's largest firm, via China Three Gorges and China's state-owned international investment company CNIC. It also has a stake in Portugal's biggest private bank, BCP, and its leading insurance company, Fidelidade. Seeking 'large-scale investment' Perhaps the most contentious issue is China Three Gorges' bid to take a controlling stake in EDP, of which it is already the main stakeholder. The operation, launched in May, involves some nine billion euros. But while it has been welcomed by the Portuguese government it still risks running foul of barriers imposed by regulators in around 15 countries where EDP operates - including the United States. Luis Castro Henriques, head of Portugal's trade and investment agency AICEP, says Chinese investment in Portugal has been good for the country. China has risen to Portugal's 11th-largest trade partner in the decade since 2008, when it was 28th on the list. ""We want now to attract large-scale industrial investment, notably in the automobile and agro-food sectors,"" Castro Henriques said."

China's President Xi Jinping speaks as he gives a joint statement to the press along with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela (out of frame) after holding a meeting, at the presidential palace in Panama City, on December 3, 2018. China said on Wednesday that Beijing and Washington will push forward with trade negotiations in the next 90 days and it is confident that an agreement can be reached, as doubts grow over whether the two sides can resolve their deep differences. The Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement on its website, also said China would work to implement specific issues already agreed upon as quickly as possible. The ministry's statement follows a period of relative quiet from Beijing after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. Scepticism on deal The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. But the mood has quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides will be able to reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period that was agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh US tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March. The Commerce Ministry said China-US trade and economic discussions were ""very successful"". The statement did not mention Trump or Xi, however, the state news agency Xinhua later said the ministry statement was hailing their meeting. ""We are confident in implementation...The economic and trade teams from both sides will actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map,"" it said. ""The Chinese side will start with implementing specifics on which there is already consensus, the faster the better."" Deal or tariffs Trump, via Twitter, threatened to place ""major tariffs"" on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. ""We are either going to have a real deal with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future,"" Trump wrote in a post within minutes of the Commerce Ministry statement. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the leaders' meeting, and there have been some differences between US and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails. A Chinese official told Reuters officials were ""waiting for the leaders to return"" before publicising details. President Xi Jinping and his most senior officials, including the commerce minister and the country's two top diplomats, are in Portugal, and due back in China on Thursday. US financial markets tumbled on Tuesday as doubts over what could realistically get accomplished in the tight negotiating window added to concerns about fading global growth."

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said US sanctions were ""economic terrorism"", as he sought to foster a united front from visiting regional officials on Saturday. Addressing parliament speakers from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey, Rouhani said they had all suffered economic pressure from the US. ""We are facing an all-out assault which is not only threatening our independence and identity but also is bent on breaking our longstanding ties,"" he said. The Trump administration in Washington has reimposed an oil embargo and other damaging sanctions on Iran since withdrawing in May from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers. ""America's unjust and illegal sanctions against the honourable nation of Iran have targeted our nation in a clear instance of terrorism,"" Rouhani said. ""Economic terrorism is designed to create panic in the economy of a country and fear in other countries in order to prevent investment."" The conference in Tehran was a second annual meeting of parliament speakers focused on terrorism and regional cooperation. The first was held last December in Islamabad. Most participating countries have faced harsh sanctions and other economic pressure as part of the Trump administration's use of trade as a diplomatic weapon. A brief truce in Trump's trade war with China was again in doubt this week after the arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who was detained in Canada to face fraud charges in the US. Washington has continued to pile fresh sanctions on Russia that began over its military intervention in Ukraine, while two Turkish ministers also faced temporary sanctions this year over the detention of an American pastor. 'We are all punished'  Trump has also cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, accusing it of failing to crack down on militancy. ""When they put pressure on China's trade, we are all harmed... By punishing Turkey, we are all punished. Any time they threaten Russia, we too consider our security to be endangered,"" Rouhani said. ""When they impose sanctions on Iran, they deprive all of us of the benefits of international trade, energy security and sustainable development. And in fact, they impose sanctions on everyone. ""We are here to say that we don't intend to tolerate such insolence."" Rouhani warned Europe - which has strongly objected to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal - that much is at stake in its efforts to bypass US sanctions and maintain trade with Iran. ""They should know that by sanctioning Iran, they would harm our ability to fight drugs and terrorism,"" Rouhani said, referring to Iran's efforts to combat smuggling, particularly from Afghanistan. The European Union is working on a payment system, known as the ""special purpose vehicle"", to keep money flowing into Iran, but has struggled to find a host since many countries fear repercussions from the Trump administration."

Michael Kovrig, an employee with the International Crisis Group and former Canadian diplomat appears in this photo provided by the International Crisis Group in Brussels, Belgium on December 11, 2018. A former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, two sources said on Tuesday, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release. Michael Kovrig's detention comes after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on December 1 at the request of US authorities, a move that has infuriated Beijing. It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China. ""International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its North East Asia Senior Adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,"" the think-tank said in a statement. ""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,"" it added. China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to questions faxed about Kovrig's detention. The exact reason for the detention, which was made sometime early this week, according to the sources, was not immediately clear. The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa. Calls to Kovrig's phones were not answered. Diplomatic spat Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017. From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Following Meng's arrest, China on Saturday summoned Canada's ambassador in Beijing and warned of severe ""consequences"" if Ottawa did not see that she was immediately released. Meng is set to return to a Vancouver courtroom on Tuesday, as the judge weighs final issues in determining whether she should be freed on bail while awaiting proceedings for her possible extradition to the United States. Washington has made accusations that Meng misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring severe penalties. Locked in a bitter trade war, Washington and Beijing earlier this month agreed to delay a planned January 1 increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, allowing more time to negotiate over China's huge bilateral trade surplus and US complaints that it steals technology. Chinese experts have said that Beijing was trying to separate Meng's arrest from the trade negotiations, but also warned that public anger in China over Canada's move could compel officials there to take measures that would further sour US-China ties and endanger talks. In 2014, a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, were detained a week after Canada accused China of hacking into the national computer system.

The Chinese national flag flies in front of a Catholic church in the village of Huangtuang, Hebei province, China, September 30, 2018. A second bishop from China's 'underground' Catholic church is stepping aside and is being replaced by a government-backed clergyman, state-run media reported, amid a thaw in relations between Beijing and the Vatican. There are an estimated 10 million Catholics in China, divided between a government-run association whose clergy are approved by the Communist Party, and the unofficial church which answers to the Vatican. An agreement struck in September on the appointment of bishops has paved the way for a rapprochement between China and the Holy See, which cut off diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1951. Zhuang Jianjian, bishop of the Shantou diocese in southern China will retire and be replaced by Huang Bingzhang, deputy chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the Global Times reported. The Vatican-issued mandate was given to Huang last week by a delegation from Rome that met several Chinese bishops, the state-linked paper reported. ""The mission now is to unite Catholics in the diocese and reduce divergence so as to achieve the common goal of better serving church members,"" Huang told the Global Times. ""This doesn't come as a surprise because Zhuang Jianjian is already 88, so he would have wanted to retire more than a decade ago,"" said Anthony Lam, a Chinese Catholic church expert at Hong Kong's Holy Spirit Study Centre. According to canon laws that govern the Catholic church, bishops ""are requested"" to submit their resignation at the age of 75. The Catholic pope can either approve the resignation or request that they wait for a suitable successor to emerge, Lam said. ""The agreement between China and the Vatican has solved this problem because the seven bishops previously excommunicated have been restored to the church, so Huang Bingzhang will be able to take up the position."" The Vatican excommunicated Huang in 2011 for being ordained as a bishop without papal approval. This is a slightly different situation from that of fellow underground bishop Guo Xijin, who was last week asked to step aside in the eastern Fujian province to make way for government-approved clergy, Lam noted. Guo instead will serve as ""auxiliary bishop"" – someone who assists and works alongside the diocesan bishop – while both the unofficial and official churches of the diocese will merge. Guo's case was at the centre of last week's negotiations between China and the Vatican, which have been asking him to leave his post since 2017 to allow for talks aimed at ending their decades-old spat. Separately, the official church said it is facing a lack of bishops and called for ""politically reliable"" clergymen with ""good ethics,"" the Global Times reported on Wednesday. Nearly half of China's 98 Catholic dioceses have no leaders, chairman of the China Bishops Conference Ma Yinglin told a seminar, according to the paper."

SWAT members of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau storm a hijacked bus during a joint anti-terrorism and riot control drill with a special unit of China's paramilitary police force at a training ground on the outskirts of Beijing Thursday, September 23, 2010. Eight people were killed and 22 injured after a hijacked bus crashed into pedestrians in east China's Fujian province on Tuesday afternoon, state media reported. A hijacker carrying a knife had been detained and was being investigated by local police, state television CGTN reported. A video posted by Duowei news, a Chinese media outlet based in the US, showed several injured people lying on the street near a crashed bus.  It also showed police wrestling a person to the ground. Blood could also be seen on the steps of the bus, which had been stopped in the middle of a road. State-run news agency Xinhua reported the suspect was a 48-year-old local man surnamed Qiu. He had attacked a female passenger before taking control of the bus, Duowei reported. Police said that on the day of the attack the suspect had quarrelled with a local official who had visited his home, adding that the pair had a long history of conflict, according to the Xinhua report. The 22 wounded in the attack were taken to local hospitals, with one person being treated for ""serious injures"", Xinhua said. Spate of attacks China has suffered a spate of similar incidents this year. In late November, a car ploughed into a group of children crossing a street in front of an elementary school in the northeastern Liaoning province, killing five people and injuring at least 19. The driver said he ""chose his victims at random"" and had reportedly been contemplating suicide due to domestic troubles before the tragedy occurred. In October, three people were killed when a man fleeing after committing a stabbing drove into a crowd and attacked onlookers in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The month before, a man ploughed a truck into a crowd in Hunan province and went on a rampage, attacking onlookers with knives and a shovel. Eleven died and 44 were injured. Grisly car accidents are common in China, where transportation authorities have struggled to uphold safety regulations – which are often flouted or go unenforced. According to authorities 58,000 people were killed in accidents across the country in 2015 alone. Last month, at least 13 people died when a bus plunged off a bridge in Chongqing municipality, after the driver got into a fist fight with a passenger who had missed her bus stop. Search and rescue teams dispatched more than 70 boats, as well as a team of scuba divers and underwater robots, to find the wreckage and retrieve bodies from the water."

exiled tycoon Guo Wengui, who lives in New York and has courted
international attention with his explosive claims about the
leadership of the ruling Communist Party. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court said in a statement
on its website that it had reached the verdict on the grounds
that Ma had taken a ""particularly enormous"" amount of bribes,
and that his collaboration with Guo's company were ""particularly
serious"". Ma had used his position to conspire with Guo and to help
businesses Guo controlled by using threats to bring about
illegal transactions such as compelling individuals to transfer
company shares, the court said. Ma had received more than $14.56 million (100 million yuan)
in property for his work and earned nearly 5 million yuan from
trading stocks based on insider information, the court said. Ma said that he accepted the ruling and would not appeal,
according to the court said. It was not possible to contact Ma for comment. Guo could not
immediately be reached for comment. Ma was put under investigation for corruption in 2015 and
expelled from the Communist Party the following year after
prosecutors accused him of interfering in unspecified law
enforcement activities. Dozens of senior officials have been investigated or jailed
since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, vowing to root
out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the
Communist Party’s grip on power. The powerful state security ministry spies on its citizens
and foreigners domestically and internationally. It is one of
the most opaque agencies in China and does not have a public

As a partial shutdown of the US government entered its eighth day, with no quick end in sight, the Republican president was in Washington, sending out tweets attacking Democrats and talking up possibly improved relations with China. The two nations have been in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies has been disrupted by tariffs. Trump and Xi agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war, deciding to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting December 1 while they negotiate a deal to end the dispute following months of escalating tensions. Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! Chinese state media also said Xi and Trump spoke on Saturday and quoted Xi as saying that teams from both countries have been working to implement a consensus reached with Trump. ""I hope that the two teams will meet each other halfway, work hard, and strive to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial and beneficial to the world as soon as possible,"" Xi said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The leaders of both the United States and China want ""stable progress"" in ties, Xi said during the call. ""China attaches great importance to the development of bilateral relations and appreciates the willingness of the US side to develop cooperative and constructive bilateral relations."" Billions of dollars of losses  The US-China trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018, hitting industries including automobiles, technology - and above all, agriculture.

A lower-level round of talks between the US and China will take place in Washington on Tuesday, the White House said on Monday. The talks follow a round of negotiations that ended in Beijing last week without a deal but which officials said had generated progress on contentious issues between the world's two largest economies. The talks are aimed at ""achieving needed structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China. The two sides will also discuss China's pledge to purchase a substantial amount of goods and services from the United States,"" the White House said in a statement. Both governments have expressed optimism but they have given no details of their talks.

Beijing hopes for ""a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement that is acceptable to both sides,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. The talks on Thursday will be led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a strong proponent of pressing China to end practices that the US says include forced technology transfers from US companies and intellectual property theft. The White House said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and trade adviser Peter Navarro would also take part in the talks. US tariffs on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1.

Taiwan will not accept any deal that destroys its sovereignty and democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday after the island's opposition KMT party said it could sign a peace deal with China if it wins a presidential election next year. China claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island, which it regards as sacred territory, under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. While China has not broached the idea of a peace deal in years, the chairman of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), Wu Den-yih, said last week the party could sign a peace deal with China if it won the hotly contested election. ""Taiwan society will not accept any treaty that harms Taiwan's national sovereignty and democracy,"" Tsai told reporters in Taipei. She said there won't be real peace unless China rules out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing was expected to make fresh overtures to the KMT ahead of the elections, security sources in Taiwan's government familiar with the matter told Reuters, a move they said could isolate Tsai's government and sway the election results. Losing out in polls Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party suffered stinging losses to the KMT in mayoral and local elections in November. Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo, has said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect Taipei's democratic values. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies.

In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before proceeding to their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Friday, February 22, 2019. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented a $10 billion deal for a refining and petrochemical complex in China on Friday, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping who urged joint efforts to counter extremism and terror. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, arrived on Thursday on an Asia tour that has already seen the kingdom pledged investment of $20 billion in Pakistan and seek to make additional investments in India's refining industry. ""China is a good friend and partner to Saudi Arabia,"" President Xi Jinping told the crown prince in front of reporters. ""The special nature of our bilateral relationship reflects the efforts you have made,"" added Xi, who has made stepping up China's presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia's relations with China dated back ""a very long time in the past."" ""In the hundreds, even thousands, of years, the interactions between the sides have been friendly. Over such a long period of exchanges with China, we have never experienced any problems with China,"" he said. Crown Prince Mohammed, who has come under fire in the West following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October, said Saudi Arabia saw great opportunities with China. ""The Silk Road initiative and China's strategic orientation are very much in line with the kingdom's Vision 2030,"" he said according to SPA, referring to Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform programme. Trade between the countries increased by 32 percent last year, he said. Saudi Arabia also said it was working to add Chinese to the curriculum in Saudi schools and universities. ""The introduction of Chinese to the curriculum is an important step towards the opening of new horizons for students,"" the government said in a statement. China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh, since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi Arabia's regional foe, Iran. China is also wary of criticism from Muslim countries about its camps in the heavily Muslim far western region of Xinjiang, which the government says are for de-radicalisation purposes and rights groups call internment camps. Xi told the crown prince the two countries must strengthen international cooperation on de-radicalisation to ""prevent the infiltration and spread of extremist thinking,"" Chinese state TV reported. Saudi Arabia respected and supported China's right to protect its own security and take counterterror and de-radicalisation steps, the crown prince told Xi, according to the same report, and was willing to increase cooperation. Meeting the crown prince earlier on Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said the two countries should enhance exchanges on their experiences in de-radicalisation, China's official Xinhua news agency said in a separate report. Chinese state media made no direct mention of Xinjiang in their stories on the crown prince's meetings. Deals signed Aramco agreed to form a joint venture with Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in the northeastern Chinese city of Panjin, saying the project was worth more than $10 billion. The partners would form a company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Co as part of a project that would include a 300,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery with a 1.5-million-metric tonnes per year ethylene cracker, Aramco said. Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the crude feedstock for the complex, which is expected to start operations in 2024. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, a position Russia has held for the last three years. Saudi Aramco is set to boost market share by signing supply deals with non-state Chinese refiners. Aramco also signed an agreement to buy a nine percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, Saudi state news agency SPA said . This formalised a previously announced plan to gain a stake in a 400,000-bpd refinery and petrochemicals complex in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai. China sees ""enormous potential"" in Saudi Arabia's economy and wants more high-tech cooperation, State Councillor Wang Yi, the Chinese government's top diplomat, said on Thursday. But China was not seeking to play politics in the Middle East, the widely read state-run tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial. ""China won't be a geopolitical player in the Middle East. It has no enemies and can cooperate with all countries in the region,"" said the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily. ""China's increasing influence in the Middle East comes from pure friendly cooperation. Such a partnership will be welcomed by more countries in the Middle East."""

Flags fly as members of Egyptian security forces stand guard before the start of a summit between Arab league and European Union member states, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, February 24, 2019. Leaders from European Union and Arab League countries pledged on Sunday to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to tackle unauthorised migration at a first-ever summit high in symbolism but likely to yield few concrete results. Under tight security at the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi opened two days of talks with a speech celebrating what he described as historic cooperation between the two organizations. But despite the public display of unity, just drafting a summit statement has proved difficult.  EU and Arab League foreign ministers failed to agree earlier this month on a text after Hungary objected to the section on migration. Europe's migration challenge is at the heart of the two-day meeting, being held under the slogan ""Investing in Stability.""  Desperate to bring migrant arrivals under control, the EU offered the summit last October as a symbolic sweetener to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi. What EU wants from Sisi The EU wants Sisi to order the Egyptian coast guard to pick up migrants leaving Libya and take them back to the African mainland, ensuring they do not become Europe's responsibility. Sissi, in turn, receives high-profile European recognition, promotion for Sharm el Sheikh, and is likely to avoid any lessons on human rights. While the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean has now dropped to a seven-year low, Europe's inability to agree on how to manage the arrivals has sparked a major political crisis, as nations bicker over who should take responsibility and whether other EU partners should help out.  Some, like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary, claim that extremists are entering among the refugees. Praises for Egypt  Just days before the summit, the head of the EU's border and coast guard agency praised the authorities in Cairo for preventing any migrant from setting out for Europe from the Egyptian coast since 2016. ""There are no boats coming directly from Egypt to the European Union,"" Frontex director Fabrice Leggeri said. ""The cooperation with Egypt is really encouraging and is developing."" The EU routinely trumpets an agreement it reached with Turkey for slowing migrant arrivals to a trickle in exchange for up to 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in aid for Syrian refugees there and other incentives. It has pledged to replicate the deal in northern Africa. Ahead of this inaugural summit, experts and European officials played down any expectation of major results. Important timing ""The timing is very important because it comes after eight years of instability in the Mediterranean affecting Europe and the Middle East,"" Saeed Sadek, professor of political sociology at the Canadian University in Cairo told The Associated Press. ""Both sides want to know how can we stabilise the area further, produce stability, how can we deal with the consequences and prevent any further escalations,"" said Sadek. ""But the imbalance of power between the two sides may not produce the concrete results that people imagine."" May to seek Saudi influence in Yemen British Prime Minister Theresa May will call on Saudi Arabia's King Salman to use his influence to encourage Yemeni parties towards peace, telling a summit that governments must redouble efforts to secure a political settlement to the crisis. ""My message in Sharm el Sheikh is clear: let us now redouble our efforts to build on the progress made and get the Stockholm agreements implemented in full,"" May said on the way to the EU-League of Arab states summit in Egypt. ""I will also use this summit to reiterate to King Salman the importance of Saudi Arabia continuing to use their influence to encourage the Yemeni parties towards peace, as they did so pivotally in Stockholm. And I will underline the UK's ongoing commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia and the region."" The war in Yemen has largely been stalemated for years, with a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states and Yemeni allies unable to dislodge the Houthi movement that controls the capital and most major population centres. A ceasefire was agreed at talks at a castle near Stockholm last month.  The agreement also foresees a political track of talks to end the war. But a lack of progress could test the patience of the United Arab Emirates, which leads military operations on Yemen's Red Sea coast for the Saudi-led coalition"

I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues. As a result of these very...... ....productive talks, I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. & China! Trump said that if negotiations progress, he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida resort to finalise an agreement. Speaking to governors gathered at the White House for an annual black-tie ball on Sunday, Trump said he was doing ""very well"" with China. ""If all works well we're going to have some very big news over the next week or two,"" he said, though he took care to add that ""we still have a little ways to go."" The reprieve is likely to be greeted with relief by financial markets. US and Chinese negotiators met through the weekend as they seek to resolve a trade war that has rattled financial markets. Trump had warned he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on $200 billion in Chinese imports, from 10 to 25 percent, if the two sides failed to reach a deal. The increase was scheduled to take effect at 12:01 am EST (05:01 GMT) on March 2. Kate Fisher has more from Washington DC. Mounting pressure The world's two biggest economies have been locked in a conflict over US allegations that China steals technology and forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in an aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance. The two counties have slapped import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods. The conflict has shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy, putting pressure on Trump and Xi to reach a deal. ""Trump clearly wants a deal and so do the Chinese, which certainly raises the probability that the two sides will come to some sort of negotiated agreement, even if it is a partial one, in the coming weeks,"" said Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. But business groups and lawmakers in Congress want to see a comprehensive deal that forces the Chinese to change their behaviour and can be enforced."

US President Donald Trump announces a deal to end the partial government shutdown as he speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, US, January 25, 2019. US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would consider extending the deadline for a trade deal with China beyond March 1. ""If we're close to a deal, where we think we can make a real deal... I could see myself letting that slide for a little while,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. But he added: ""Generally speaking I'm not inclined to do that."" The comments came as the third round of trade negotiations were set to resume in Beijing to avert more than doubling tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. ""China wants to make a deal very badly,"" he said, and ""things are going well"" in the talks. And while no date has yet been agreed for a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, he said he expects that to happen ""at some point."" The high-stakes dispute has raised concerns it could spill over into the global economy after Trump last year hit China with 25 percent punitive tariffs on $50 billion in goods, and then imposed 10 percent duties on another $200 billion in annual imports. The rate on all those imports are set to increase to 25 percent if no agreement is reached by March 1. China's economy already has shown signs of slowing, while the trade war has shaken the confidence of US businesses, as retaliatory tariffs have raised prices and helped choke off a key export market. And Trump's aggressive strategy has failed to produce a reduction in the US trade deficit with China, which he set as a primary goal. He repeated the incorrect statement that China is paying the duties, which in fact are paid by US companies importing goods. And economists say much of the intended effect of the duties in reducing imports, has been offset by the devaluation of China's currency, which makes goods cheaper for importers."

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laughs as he attends a meeting with Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs (not pictured) in the ministry building in Budapest, Hungary, February 11, 2019. When US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary this week to shore up long-standing relations, he also came with a warning for his NATO partners; that they are the targets of a campaign by Russia and China to divide the West. Arriving in Bratislava yesterday, Pompeo reminded Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajack of his country’s history of oppression under four decades of communism and “the aggressive role Russia continues to play in the region”. Invoking Russia’s annexation of Crimea, he encouraged Central Europe to embrace closer defence ties with the US and to become more aware of political manipulation from Moscow. “Russia and China are authoritarian powers who do not share our joint aspirations of freedom,” he said during a joint news conference in Budapest on Monday with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Poland and Hungary in particular are seen as increasingly undemocratic countries with right-wing governments that have cosied up to Russia and China in recent years. Earlier this month, Washington-based think tank Freedom House downgraded Hungary from ""free"" to ""partly free"" in its annual freedom survey, making it the only EU country in that category. ""We must not let Putin drive wedges between friends in NATO,"" Pompeo continued. In the first visit by a US secretary of state in eight years, Pompeo placed part of the blame on the US and its absence from the region. “Secretary Pompeo needs to treat this trip not as a friendly meeting between allies, but as an opportunity to have a frank conversation with a state increasingly at odds with both American interests and its human rights obligations,” Human Rights First said in a statement. While Hungary would go on to sign a defence cooperation agreement with the US on Monday, as well as agreeing to buy US military equipment, the trip would not come without tension, with Szijjarto stating that Budapest has grown tired of the West’s “enormous hypocrisy” with regards to Russia. At the same time, Pompeo managed to raise eyebrows by stating a US intention to fight corruption and strengthen support for independent media in all the Visegrad Four (V4) countries. Each of the V4 countries (the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary) have been accused of large-scale government corruption in recent years, while Hungary and Poland in particular have decimated media outlets that are critical of the government. “If you look at the Hungarian media, the independents are against the rightist government – they have labelled them as socialist-liberal – so [in the new US position] there is certainly an ideological underpinning,” Balazs Jarabik, a nonresident scholar of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Europe think-tank, told TRT World. He said that while the US would most likely focus on countering a mass anti-EU disinformation campaign perpetrated by Moscow in recent years, it was nonetheless inappropriate for them to tamper with the media landscape of sovereign countries. “Yes, the Hungarian government controls most of the media, about 60 percent, but does not control the public opinion. Whether it is the job of the Americans to strengthen independent media, I don’t think so,” he said. In Hungary on Monday, Pompeo also warned Europe that using technology from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei could hurt their relationship with the United States, adding that it has an obligation to alert other governments to the risks of building networks with equipment from the mobile operator. His statement comes amid the latest efforts to push Huawei out of lucrative fifth generation (5G) contracts around the world over what it believes to be serious security threats. Despite security concerns, Hungary and Slovakia have remained in Huawei’s corner, saying the company does not pose such a threat in their countries. Jarabik said Pompeo’s statement has more to do with protecting American business interests in a region that has been increasingly looking elsewhere. “This is a part of selling American. Pompeo and the Americans have proved to be a very effective salesmen and this is all about that,” he said."

High waves hit the shore at Heng Fa Chuen, a residental district near the waterfront, as Typhoon Mangkhut slams Hong Kong, China September 16, 2018. A super typhoon made landfall in China's Guangdong on Sunday, the country's most populous province, after wreaking havoc in Hong Kong and Macau and killing at least 69 people in the Philippines, with two additional deaths reported in China.  Packing gale force winds of more than 200 kph, tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year, equivalent to a maximum Category 5 ""intense hurricane"" in the Atlantic. The eye of Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia's mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 km south of Hong Kong but the former British colony was still caught in the typhoon's swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds. Buried in mud Typhoon Mangkhut lashed the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain that caused landslides feared to have buried dozens.  Landslides caused by the pounding storm hit two villages in Itogon town in the Philippine mountain province of Benguet. Police Superintendent Pelita Tacio said 34 villagers had died and 36 were missing. The rescue work halted for the night before resuming Monday morning. Men used pikes and shovels to dig into the mud since the soaked ground was unstable and limited the use of heavy equipment on site. TRT World's
Arabella Munro has more.  Philippine death toll feared to rise In the Philippines, casualties reported by various agencies on Sunday evening indicate the death toll from the impact of Mangkhut could exceed 50, with most killed in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region. Francis Tolentino, an advisor to President Rodrigo Duterte and head of the government's disaster coordination, said the latest number of casualties was 33 dead and 56 missing. TRT World's Natasha Hussain reports. But the head of the military's Northern Luzon Command, Emmanuel Salamat, told Reuters that at least 19 more were killed in landslides in one part of Benguet province. The 19 who died were part of a bigger group of 43 people, likely miners, and those who were still alive were feared to be trapped in an old mining bunkhouse that had collapsed under rubble, according to Tolentino. Search and rescue missions were ongoing, and a local mayor in Benguet, Victorio Palangdan, said he feared the number killed there could be more than 100. Separately, the coastguard said it had recovered the bodies of three people. In Macau, which halted casino gambling late on Saturday and put China's People's Liberation Army on standby for disaster relief help, some streets were flooded. ""The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,"" said authorities in the world's largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage. Earlier, TRT World spoke to Hong Kong-based journalist Patrick Fok for more details. ""King of storms"" The typhoon, dubbed the ""King of Storms"" by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5:00 pm. local time, packing winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), weather officials said. Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas were also reduced as a precaution. In Shenzhen, electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday. The storm has fuelled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output, at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop. Guangdong is also China's most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million. The airport in the boomtown of Shenzhen has been shut since midnight, and will be closed until 8:00 am. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have been cancelled in Guangzhou and the neighbouring island province of Hainan. High winds and swells have also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 metres (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. Mangkhut's northwesterly track will bring heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday, before it weakens into a tropical depression to reach southwestern Yunnan next day."

China's President Xi Jinping attends the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge at the Zhuhai Port terminal on October 23, 2018. China’s President Xi Jinping launched the world’s longest sea bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China Tuesday at a time when Beijing is tightening its grip on its semi-autonomous territories. Xi announced the bridge officially open at a ceremony also attended by Hong Kong’s and Macau’s city leaders at a new port terminal in the southern mainland city of Zhuhai. “I declare the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge officially open,” Xi said as digital fireworks exploded on a screen behind him in an indoor ceremony, before leaving the stage immediately. He did not address the audience. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam had earlier spoken to thank Xi for attending in person, praising the bridge’s “magnificence”. It is the second major infrastructure project tying Hong Kong to mainland China to launch in a matter of weeks, after the opening of a high-speed rail link last month, and is part of a Beijing-driven strategy to create a sprawling “Greater Bay Area” economic hub. Critics say the new multi-billion-dollar sea-bridge is one more way to integrate Hong Kong into China as fears grow that the city’s cherished freedoms are being eroded. The mega bridge will open to traffic on Wednesday. Building began in 2009 and has been dogged by delays, budget overruns, corruption prosecutions and the deaths of construction workers. The launch ceremony was hastily announced last week by mainland authorities with Hong Kong lawmakers and transport companies complaining they had been left in the dark. Supporters of the project promote it as an engineering marvel that will also boost business and cut travel time, while others see it as a politically driven and costly white elephant. The main bridge section is considered mainland territory and Hong Kong cars and drivers travelling over it “must comply with the laws and regulations of the mainland”, according to the city’s transport department. ""It’s magnificent"" There was no ceremony on the Hong Kong side Tuesday, but there was a heightened police presence in coastal areas near the bridge, with officers carrying out identity checks on journalists and members of the public. Hong Kong residents will only be granted a licence to cross into Zhuhai by car if they meet highly selective criteria, including holding certain mainland government positions or making major contributions to charities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Most people will need to travel the bridge on coaches and buses. Online commenters in Hong Kong complained about the bridge’s restricted access ahead of the launch. “Such a huge investment using the Hong Kong taxpayer’s money... yet basically it is not open to us at all,” said one comment on the South China Morning Post website. But residents in Zhuhai welcomed the bridge. “I think this bridge will bring great convenience to the whole area of Zhuhai, Hong Kong and Macao, and promote the economic development of the whole area of the Pearl River Delta,” resident Dang Zheiliang told AFP. Resident Can Binghua paid a visit to the bridge on his day off. “Today I’m off duty, so I took my child to see the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Now it’s almost open to traffic. It’s magnificent,” he told AFP. Some Hong Kong media reported that the physical condition of bus drivers would be monitored by cameras, including an alert sent if a driver yawns more than three times in 20 seconds. China already lays claim to the record for the world’s longest bridge of any kind — the Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge, a viaduct which is part of a high-speed rail line. The opening of the high-speed rail link last month also sparked criticism as it saw Chinese security stationed on Hong Kong soil for the first time at the city’s terminus. Critics accused the Hong Kong government of giving away territory to an increasingly assertive Beijing."

China's Premier Li Keqiang (L) gestures as he speaks with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as they arrive to pose for a family photograph during an ASEM summit at the European Council in Brussels on October 19, 2018. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe makes a rare trip to China on Thursday hoping improved relations will lead to new economic partnerships, as the two countries come under US pressure on trade. The visit is the first by a Japanese premier since 2011 and is part of a years-long process of repairing ties in the wake of a disastrous falling-out in 2012, when Tokyo “nationalised” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. The incident prompted anti-Japanese riots in China, and kicked off a frosty spell that has only gradually and recently begun to thaw. TRT World's Samantha Vadas reports. Since an awkward 2014 encounter between Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit, there have been ministerial visits by both sides and a softening of rhetoric. But Abe’s trip will be a test of how far the two countries have come, and the need for progress is all the more urgent as US President Donald Trump levies tariffs and rattles sabres on trade with both China and Japan. “The trade war with the US seems like it’s helping bring them together a bit,” said Kristin Vekasi, assistant professor of political science at the University of Maine, and an expert on Japan-China ties. “In that sense, they’re actually on the same side... and if Japan leans away from the US because of decreased economic opportunities, there’s a potential for closer ties with China,” she told AFP. Complementary economies The two leaders are likely to focus on a range of potential deals, including joint investments in infrastructure in regional nations including Indonesia and the Philippines. Abe has signalled some interest in China’s massive “Belt and Road Initiative”, which funds major infrastructure work, but experts said a concrete deal on Japanese participation was unlikely for now. Both sides are keen to improve economic cooperation, with Japanese business eager for increased access to China’s massive market, and Beijing interested in Japanese technology and corporate knowhow. “Japan and China have really nicely complementary economies, and they can benefit hugely from having closer trade and investment ties,” said Vekasi. “They’ll try and bring home some economic tangibles. That’s generally where they’ve been able to successfully cooperate in the past.” The two leaders may find less common ground outside of the economic realm, with tensions lingering over territorial issues. Just days before Abe’s trip, Tokyo lodged an official complaint after Chinese ships cruised around the disputed islands that Tokyo calls the Senkaku and Beijing labels the Diaoyu islands. And in September, Japan carried out its first submarine drills in the disputed South China Sea. Japan does not border the South China Sea but has expressed concern about Chinese military activity there. Panda diplomacy?  Abe and Xi are likely to simply avoid those thornier issues, said Kazuyuki Suwa, a professor of political science at the University of Shizuoka. “Neither side will make any compromises... They will say what they need to say, and won’t likely agree to go beyond that,” he told AFP. “The relationship is a mixture of cooperation and confrontation, and that will stay the same.” Much of the meeting will be about optics, with both men looking for the symbolic boost that the summit will provide. Abe will also be hoping to extract a pledge that China will make good on plans for Xi to pay a reciprocal visit to Japan next year. If he succeeds, “that itself should be called one of the major achievements of this trip,” Suwa said. And there may be other diplomatic tools at the ready as well. When Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited Japan earlier this year, he announced a gift of a pair of rare wild crested ibises, which arrived this month. Japanese media have reported Abe is hoping that his visit will produce a bigger bonanza in the form of some panda diplomacy, with zoos in Sendai and Kobe apparently angling for new additions."

US and Chinese negotiators start two days of high-level talks Wednesday aimed at settling a six-month trade war that has weakened both sides, shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy. Yet the odds seem stacked against any substantive resolution this week to the standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Perhaps the best that might be hoped for, analysts say, is for the two sides to agree to keep talking. The differences between Beijing and Washington are vast. The United States is essentially demanding that China downsize its economic aspiration to become a supreme world leader in such fields as robotics and electric cars. At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Alibaba's CEO, Daniel Zhang noted that China has more than one billion consumers, and he maintains that as long as conditions are right, it can be a self-sufficient market."" The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December.

Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

(Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

US Dollar and China Yuan notes are seen in this picture illustration. Three days of US-Chinese talks aimed at ending a costly tariff battle wrapped up Wednesday in an optimistic atmosphere after President Donald Trump said they were ""going very well!"" No details were immediately announced, but Asian stock markets rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un poses for photos in Pyongyang on January 1, 2019 (Credit: North Korea's Korean Central News Agency). North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday on an unannounced visit for talks with President Xi Jinping, as preparations ramp up for an expected second summit with Donald Trump. South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. A motorcade was seen leaving a Beijing train station, with police blocking a street with metal gates hours after Kim's train crossed the border into northern China, according to AFP journalists. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Hong Kong for more. Last year, Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the US and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that US State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The US State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. ""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. ""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."" At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea's foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks."""

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

A banner is reflected on a polished surface as China's President Xi Jinping (C) speaks during an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 2, 2019. Taiwan's unification with the mainland is ""inevitable"", President Xi Jinping said on January 2, warning against any effort to promote the island's independence and saying China would not renounce the option of military force to bring it into the fold. With détente seeming to settle upon the Korean peninsula, East Asia’s most dangerous flashpoint may now be Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping is morphing into a better dressed version of Mao Zedong and reviving Mao-style policies throughout the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and beyond. One of his targets, the subject of his New Year’s address, is Taiwan. Up until January 1, forty years ago, there were two Chinas. At least, until then the US formally recognised the Republic of China, located on the island of Taiwan, which claimed to be the legitimate government of all China. No one really believed that, and Washington had begun talking with Beijing in 1972. After that countries accelerated their shift in recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The mainland’s diplomatic advantage grew along with its economy. Today just 16 small, mostly African and Latin American nations, recognise the ROC, which has been denied independent status in international organisations as well. However, even that does not satisfy the Xi government, which wants “reunification”. The island has been out of the mainland’s control for more than 120 years, other than a brief period after World War II. On New Year’s Day, Xi gave a major speech addressing Taiwan, expressing his government’s willingness “to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”. However, he warned: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures [to achieve Beijing’s ends].” Which sounds like American presidents who proclaim that “all options are the table,” code words threatening war. Xi sought to paint a positive picture of Chinese control: “Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.” Alas, he offered no guarantees to preserve Taiwan’s free society and democratic system. Nor would any such promises be believable. Xi’s turn toward totalitarianism, including the incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in reeducation camps, creates a fearsome prospect for a united future. While he cited Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework as the model, Beijing has steadily tightened its control over that territory, despite pledging to preserve British-style liberties. Even before Xi’s reincarnation as Mao, the Taiwanese people turned decisively against “reunification” with China. A vanishingly small proportion of the young identify with the mainland. Their connection with the PRC is minimal; Taiwan is their home. And they have no reason to voluntarily choose what amounts to a foreign dictatorship, which during its worst times proved to be one of the bloodiest tyrannies in human history. But even if the mainland were democratic, why would the Taiwanese want to be submerged in the neighbouring colossus? Take away the idea of defence against foreign invaders, and the only country threatening to attack Taiwan is the PRC, there is no reason for the former to become just another brick in a Chinese imperial wall. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen spoke a day before Xi, insisting that his government respect Taiwanese liberty and democracy. Her party did badly in the recent elections, but that did not reflect a pro-Beijing surge, rather, domestic issues dominated. Taiwan’s people recognise that a declaration of independence would risk war, so most support today’s ambiguous status. If the Chinese leadership was equally accommodating, the situation would be stable. But Xi, especially, appears determined to force a decision, which risks war and would significantly affect the rest of the region. Although the PRC’s military strength greatly exceeds that of Taiwan, an invasion would be difficult. Washington has, at best, an ambiguous military commitment to Taiwan; the president would not want war with the PRC, but would also be loath to walk away from an ally of more than seven decades. Economic sanctions, at least, would be inevitable; even Europe would likely respond to an attack on the island. Any victory by Beijing would be dearly bought. Instead, all the players need to find a compromise. For instance, while continuing to claim full sovereignty over Taiwan, the PRC should affirm its commitment to peace and withdraw some of its missiles targeted on the island. While preparing to defend itself if necessary, Taipei should eschew policies that highlight its independent existence internationally. While the US should continue selling Taiwan weapons to deter attack, the former should pledge to neither seek bases on the island nor intervene in any conflict which might erupt between Beijing and Taipei. The world is very different to 40 years ago. Unfortunately, the possibility of war over Taiwan is significantly greater today. Any military confrontation would be a disaster to all concerned. Perhaps the best China, Taiwan, and America can do is peacefully kick the controversy down the road — again."

Uighur boy is seen flying a kite in this file photo. The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper reported earlier this week that in the country's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region 1,120,000 civil servants were staying as guests at 1, 690,000 households, most of which are Muslim Uighurs. According to the paper, the officials staying at the houses, ""share their bread, celebrate holidays together, help the children with homework, develop friendships, encourage the feeling of 'National Unity and Family' and take families to Urumqi, the capital of the region for activities."" It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits. Among the civil servants staying in the homes of Uighur families, it was reported that there were public officials from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region armed forces, the Armed Police Units and the Chinese central government's representatives. The report also suggested that last year in Xinjiang, encouraged by the officials of the ""National Union and Family"" activities deepened the national unity, strengthening the links between the party officials and the local people, ""the CCP's voice was heard by thousands of families,"" the report added. An official speaking to the paper said, ""The villagers are eagerly looking forward to a modern lifestyle and understanding the good policies of the party. Nowadays, the relationship between the party and the people is rapidly developing. The villagers are ... embracing the modern civilization movement. Their lifestyle has changed and so has their thoughts."" Uighur representatives living outside of China have reacted harshly to the practice, saying officials staying at the houses on behalf of the communist party are actually there to spy on the families. Responding to the allegations, China has strongly refuted any suggestion that it is mistreating the Uighur minority. Previously, Hu Lianhe, a spokesman for China's United Front Work Department, had told a UN panel. ""There is no arbitrary detention or lack of freedom of religion and belief."" ""Xinjiang citizens including the Uighurs enjoy equal freedoms and rights."" Hu said, ""there is no such thing as re-education centres,"" but added criminals convicted of ""minor offences"" have been assigned to ""vocational educational and employment training centres with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation."" ""They are not subject to any arbitrary detention or ill-treatment there,"" Hu added."

Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman slammed Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, saying it is a ""great embarrassment"" in a written statement on Sunday. Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.  The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a Chinese state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.  ""China, show us their videos if they are alive!"" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter.  He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.  No camps China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated one million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. The country has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and UN rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who live predominantly in a region claimed by Uighurs in China, which they call East Turkistan and is home to some 10 million people, most of whom are Muslim. Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centres where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education.  Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism. Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity.""  Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the ""concentration camps"" and ""systematic assimilation"" to which Muslims in Xinjiang are subject. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement ""a very bad mistake."" Heyit under investigation Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an ""absurd lie.""  She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security. The video shows Heyit in a grey sweater against a nondescript, grey wall. He states his name and gives the date as February 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused. The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed. Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive. The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result, many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media.  On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings. If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

US President Donald Trump, left, gestures as he and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida in this file photo. (April 7, 2017) As leaders of the world's top economic powers seek to defuse tension over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, they will search for common ground on reforms to end a crisis at the institution that was created to prevent economic disputes escalating into war. The World Trade Organization is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional, just when it is most needed to fulfil its role as umpire in trade disputes and as the watchdog of global commerce. ""If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said last week. ""The WTO is doing all it can to support efforts to de-escalate the situation, but finding solutions will require political will and it will require leadership from the G20."" Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing on the effects the US-China trade war has on Chinese exporters.  The WTO has fallen victim to Trump's trade war on economic rival China and the United States has put pressure on the WTO itself to reform. Trump is unhappy with the WTO's failure to hold Beijing to account for failing to open its economy as envisioned when China joined the WTO in 2001. To force reform at the WTO, Trump's team has blocked new appointments to the world's top trade court, the WTO's Appellate Body which is now rapidly running out of judges, meaning it will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. If there are not enough judges, ""disputes go into limbo,"" former Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman said. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States earlier this year. Those, and his tariffs on Chinese imports, have drawn retaliatory tariffs, and represent the kind of dispute the WTO was created to help resolve. Numerous countries have filed litigation at the WTO to contest the tariffs. But if the WTO is unable to rule on them, Trump's aggressive policies cannot be deemed to be illegal and could continue with impunity. The US government has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to force concessions that would change the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. Chinese and US officials negotiating easing the trade tensions were making progress on Friday at a Group of 20 summit in Argentina, a Chinese official said. Court with no judges The US metals tariffs have caused a storm because they are based on what Washington says are national security concerns, which makes them exempt from WTO rules. But other countries dispute the link to national security, and are challenging it at the WTO. They fear Trump could use the same reasoning to put import tariffs on cars and other goods. Time is running out because the Appellate Body now has the minimum three members it needs to function and from December 2019 it will be down to one, so only appeals that get underway by that date have a prospect of being resolved. There is a big backlog of cases going through the WTO dispute settlement process, so the metals tariffs are unlikely to be ruled on and appealed within that time frame. ""The new cases of the US duties on steel and aluminium will not be decided... they will not finish before (the end of) 2019,"" former Appellate Body member Giorgio Sacerdoti said. Another major dispute at the WTO concerns the refusal by the European Union and the United States to recognise China as a ""market economy"" whose goods are fairly priced by the market. They say the Chinese state's involvement in the economy has created a steel and aluminium supply glut. China is pursuing legal action against the EU. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said a ruling in China's favour ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO"". That case is also bogged down. Even if the appeal lands in time, there is another potential hitch. The Appellate Body's Chinese member, Hong Zhao, may have to recuse herself because of a potential conflict of interest, which would make it impossible to decide on any appeal in the case, several trade experts told Reuters. ""It’s a very difficult situation for her,"" one diplomat said. Chinese, US, EU and WTO officials declined to comment on whether or not Zhao would need to be recused."

People walk under an electronic board showing stock information at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Lujiazui Financial Area before the visit of Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in Shanghai, China, September 22, 2015 Chinese shares, commodities and the yuan currency jumped on Monday after Chinese and US leaders agreed to a temporary truce in their bitter trade war, but the longer-term outlook for trade relations remains murky. The deal between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping postponed the most pressing threat to the global and Chinese economies - a sharp hike in US tariffs that had been slated for January 1. But analysts cautioned it has only bought a bit more time for wrangling over deeply divisive trade and policy differences, and said China's economy will continue to cool regardless under the weight of weakening domestic demand. Still, the news offered some relief for the country's battered stock markets, which had tumbled over 20 percent at one point this year, prompting a flurry of support measures. At the midday break, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index was 2.9 percent higher and blue-chip shares surged 3.1 percent. Government bond futures fell as shares rallied, with the 10-year treasury futures for March delivery, the most-traded contract, falling 0.26 percent at the open. It was last down 0.07 percent at 96.630. Shares in Hong Kong also jumped, with the Hang Seng index adding 2.7 percent at midday, and breaking through the 27,000 level for the first time since October 4. The China Enterprises Index is 2.8 percent higher at midday. ""This is a relief rally. The markets are oversold. I don't think we needed much of an excuse (for a rebound),"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The agreement ""is not a ceasefire, it's just a de-escalation. The existing tariffs are still having a negative impact on the Chinese economy, they haven't gone away."" The White House said Beijing had agreed to buy an unspecified but ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. It said the two sides would launch new talks to address issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and non-tariff barriers. But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. China praised the ""important consensus"" reached in the deal, but did not mention the 90-day deadline. Despite the differences in the wording and uncertainty about some details, the agreement was a better outcome than investors had expected, said Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities in Shanghai. At the same time, the outcome of the meeting is ""unlikely to immediately spark a turnaround in market sentiment,"" he said. ""While this means the effect of the trade war may pause for a moment, we're still facing domestic issues including slowing growth, and awaiting more information about the direction of macroeconomic policy and eagerly expected measures like tax cuts."" In onshore trade, the yuan was trading at 6.9174 per dollar at midday, after opening at 6.9278. It has lost more than 6 percent of its value so far this year as trade ties deteriorated and the US dollar firmed. The offshore yuan firmed to as high as 6.8950, and was trading at 6.9110 at midday. ""The impact on the yuan was very positive, and has prompted many market participants building up long positions in the Chinese unit,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. ""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment."" Ken Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, was less optimistic. ""The gap between China and the US ... remains quite wide, and it is very difficult for them to reach a comprehensive deal in 90 days,"" Cheung said, adding that he doesn't see ""much further movement"" for the rebound. Commodities also rallied on hopes of thawing relations. Prices of Chinese steel products and steelmaking ingredients soared more than 6 percent. ""We are expecting China to buy more LNG, LPG, corn and soybean to step up imports from US,"" said Michael Mao, energy analyst with consultancyChina Sublime Information Group. ""(The) government is also likely to issue a new import tax on these products to facilitate imports."" But some analysts cautioned about reading too much into Monday's rally. ""The fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, referring to the day's gains. ""Worries about the trade war have subsided, so investors are shifting their focus back to other things, like a stronger renminbi (or) a lower pace of rate hikes from the Fed."" China's factory activity grew slightly in November, a private survey showed on Monday, but new export orders shrank at a faster pace and manufacturers reported they were cutting prices amid soft domestic demand. The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November which showed growth in the nation's vast factory sector had effectively stalled."

arrested in Canada on December 1 and faces extradition to the United

a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions. The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei. China summons US envoy to protest detention China summoned the US ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Meng's detention. The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng ""lodged solemn representations and strong protests"" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention. The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention ""extremely egregious"" and demanded the US vacate an order for her arrest.  It quoted Le as calling for the US to ""immediately correct its wrong actions"" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges
of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a
Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30
years for each charge. No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after
nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the
hearing was adjourned until Monday. In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to
release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to
lodge a ""strong protest."" Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond
what the Minister said yesterday"". Freeland told reporters on Friday that relationship with
China is important and valued, and Canada's ambassador in
Beijing has assured Chinese that consular access will be
provided to Meng. When asked about the possible Chinese backlash after the
arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship
with Beijing. Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States
while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach
of her lawful rights, Le said. The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its
very nature ""extremely nasty,"" he added. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately
release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful,
legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full
responsibility for the serious consequences caused."" The statement did not elaborate. ""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in
high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former
Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday. ""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice
box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that.
That's the price of dealing with a country like China."" Meng's arrest was on the same day that US President Donald
Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways
to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two
largest economies. “We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you
to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,” said a
US State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The news of Meng's arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn
condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his
top economic advisers have played down its importance to trade
talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce. A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has ""every

Iran may yet survive.,6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"The EU along with Russia and China have opposed the Trump administration on trashing the Iran nuclear deal. Iran may yet survive.  As the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, sanctions were imposed on Tehran. The second phase, which was announced on November 5, was described as some of the most stringent sanctions ever by Trump. This new wave of coercive measures targets critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as energy, shipping and shipbuilding and the financial sectors. Punitive measures are nothing new to the Islamic Republic. The country has been under sanctions by the US for almost 40 years. The Iranian authorities claim they developed the resilience needed to deal with sanctions no matter how tough they are. In this context, President Hassan Rouhani stated: “We will proudly break these illegal, unjust sanctions.” The US often resorts to coercive economic measures as part of its diplomatic pressure on states that do not align with Washington's foreign policy objectives. Such policies are not only meant to show the economic strength and overall dominance of the US as a superpower, but they also intend to provoke uprisings in the poverty-stricken populace. However, there is a gap between theory and practice, and many experts believe that these policies do not break the grip of regimes in power, as seen in the cases of Venezuela, Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea. The more recent sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been entirely futile. Sanctions only harmed the poor people of these countries rather than bringing policy changes by their respective governments, just because the regimes’ ‘centres of gravity’ are usually shielded from the effect of the sanctions. Also, the sanctioned states become a lot more aggressive and use repressive means that thwart any uprising plans. Besides, economic strictures are counter-productive. Iran has lived under different boycotts, and its regime built its political legitimacy on anti-American rhetoric. The authorities will merely use this new wave of sanctions to unite the people under its leadership further. In fact, huge demonstrations already took place on November 4 to protest against the US policies. Despite claims to the contrary, the first affected will be the low-income population and the working class as they are not capable of dealing with the expected impact of the US-imposed measures. The middle class will also have trouble with sanctions due to high inflation rates which will deplete the purchasing power for all Iranians. While Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions will not involve food, medicine and basic humanitarian goods, US measures have already restricted the transfer of money which affects the importation of food and medicine. The price for medication, such as the one needed for cancer treatment, has become exorbitant. Additionally, Iranians living abroad will also be heavily impacted because of the restrictions on Iran's banking system. SWIFT, the international system for money transfer, removed its access to the Central Bank of Iran. Consequently, countless Iranian students may not be able to receive money transfers from Iran. Interestingly, the US exempted eight countries from sanctions on importing Iranian oil for six months, so they can still do business with Iran. Some observers considered such a step indicates which nations are being treated favourably by Trump. Others estimate that this exemption demonstrates the failure of this policy, which was imposed unilaterally and could not get support from Europe and other countries. Iran has emerged cleared of any wrongdoing in this particular case. Tehran has been committed to the nuclear agreement and has respected its part of the deal. The US, on the other hand, seems to be in breach of international law. Besides, by moving against Tehran unilaterally, the White House is damaging its transatlantic relations and undermining its allies. Consequently, the Trump administration has not won the battle for world public opinion given that it pursues a bellicose course of action without any valid reasons. In the foreseeable future, the United States is not likely to remove sanctions or change course in its approach vis-à-vis Iran. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic will adapt to the new situation by finding ways to export its oil and gas via different routes. The Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his confidence that the Iranian oil industry would find markets. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.” Geopolitically, Tehran will seek - more than ever - to damage US client states in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia. The latter has been considerably weakened by its ill-conceived war in Yemen and the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Also, it is predicted that Tehran will get closer to Moscow and cement their strategic relationships. Finally, Tehran will enhance its relations with neighbouring countries, which provide a crucial lifeline for Iran’s economy. These measures mean that Trump’s approach is not only doomed to fail but it also does not serve the purpose for which it was initially intended.      "

In this file photo taken on January 13, 2014 Michael Spavor walks with former US basketball player Dennis Rodman (not in picture) as they are surrounded by the media after arriving at Beijing International Airport from North Korea. China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of ""engaging in activities that endanger the national security"" of China. Lu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living. ""The legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,"" Lu told reporters at a daily briefing. Canada under growing pressure  The two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The US has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud. Canadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor ""since he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,"" Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said Wednesday. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government."" Kovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong. Spavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North's government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North's capital Pyongyang in 2013. Acquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up. ""National security charge"" The detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt's detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada's arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the US. The broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organisations. The root of the dispute appears to be Canada's arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of US sanctions. China earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn't released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of ""retaliatory measures"" if Canada doesn't free Meng. ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,"" Hu Xijin said, speaking in English. Canada asks China for extra security at its embassy Canada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters. The United States and China have emphasised that China-US trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction on Tuesday, saying he'd intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview. The suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump's assertion, saying: ""Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canadais, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law."" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was ""quite obvious"" any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure ""the process is not politicised."" ""Both Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,"" said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney. ""Trump's remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the US's reputation as a country that follows the 'rule of law,' and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks."" Trump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. US regulators planned to bar it from receiving US components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because US tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations. Speaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng's case. ""Let's see what he actually decides,"" Ross said. ""Let's see where we go from there."""

Xi and US President Donald Trump agreed early this month to a 90-day truce in the trade dispute, which halted the threatened escalation of punitive tariffs while the two sides continue negotiations. Accomplishments cited  In his speech, Xi enumerated the accomplishments of China's development.

Previously, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained. The detentions came after Canadian police arrested Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a regular news conference in Beijing, China on January 6, 2016. A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, a Canadian newspaper reported on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese telecoms executive. Canada's foreign ministry said it was ""aware of a Canadian citizen"" having been detained, according to the National Post, which cited a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson did not provide further details and did not suggest that the detention was linked to the arrest on December 1 of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the report said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that she had ""not heard"" about the reported detention. The recent detention of two Canadians has raised questions whether Beijing is holding them in retaliation for Meng's arrest, though no link has officially been made between the cases. Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings Huawei is alleged to have had with Iran. National security concerns  China has accused the other detainees – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor – of activities ""that endanger China's national security."" They were both detained on December 10. Kovrig is a Hong Kong-based senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, while Spavor facilitates trips to North Korea and helped former NBA star Dennis Rodman travel to the neighbouring country. Beijing has threatened Canada with ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not freed and Chinese state-run media have criticised the arrest, saying it was politically motivated. Ottawa has repeatedly said the arrest was not political but rather a judicial process in keeping with an extradition treaty Ottawa has with Washington. But despite escalating tensions between the two countries, the Canadian embassy in China does not seem to be holding back. On Tuesday it posted a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Charter 08, a widely circulated online petition that called for political reform in China, on Chinese social media. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died last year from liver cancer while in police custody, was arrested after co-authoring the petition, which urged protection of basic human rights and the reform of China's one-party system. "

President Erdogan said he is pleased that Turkey-China relations have kept developing and deepening. The Turkish side looks forward to carrying out closer high-level exchanges with China, speaks highly of the Belt and Road Initiative, and is ready to deepen cooperation with China in areas such as trade and economy, investment, aviation and tourism within the Belt and Road framework, he said.

US President Donald Trump, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, US President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018. China will roll back tariffs on US-made cars, US President Donald Trump said, unveiling another potential breakthrough in a trade war truce that cheered stock markets on Monday. Trump's surprise announcement late Sunday came a day after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to suspend any new tariffs and give negotiators 90 days to strike a deal. TRT World's Caitlin McGee reports. The ceasefire follows months of tensions and tit-for-tat custom duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods that raised fears of an escalation harmful to the global economy. Both sides gained from hitting the pause button, with Trump securing a Chinese pledge to import more US goods and Xi staving off the further pressure that higher tariffs would place on his country's slowing economy. Trump tweeted that China had agreed to ""reduce and remove"" tariffs of 40 percent on cars, though Beijing has yet to confirm the move. China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%. China's foreign ministry declined to confirm Trump's assertion on Monday, instead saying: ""On December 1 President Xi and President Trump reached an important consensus on trade issues."" ""They agreed to hold off on the imposition of new tariffs and came up with a series of constructive arrangements on how to address the existing differences and problems,"" spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. Trump's tweet did not explain which tariffs would be reduced or removed, or when China would act. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the car announcement, if confirmed, was ""certainly movement in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of more things to come"". Beijing had reduced auto import duties from 25 percent to 15 percent in July. But it later added a 25 percent tariff on US-made cars as trade tensions soared, bringing them to 40 percent. Many US automakers build their cars in China for the local market, but the tariff hikes have hit sales and profits for some companies including electric car-maker Tesla and US-made models from BMW and Ford. IP theft  One expert said China would have to address US complaints about China's forced transfer of intellectual property rights - a major issue at the core of a US ""301"" trade investigation -- for Washington to drop its tariffs. ""Any action which increases market access or better ensures a level playing field will certainly be welcomed and could lead to continued discussions,"" Steven Okun, a Singapore-based senior advisor at strategic advisory firm McLarty Associates, told AFP. ""Still, one must presume that as the existing and proposed tariffs are to spur China to address the US' IPR concerns, only action directly related to that would ultimately impact the 301 tariffs,"" he said. The White House said Saturday the two sides would ""immediately"" begin talks on ""structural changes"" affecting forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection and cyber theft. China reaffirmed that the agreement held ""great significance"". ""It prevents the economic and trade frictions from expanding and opens new prospects for cooperation,"" Geng said. 'No magic wand'  Asian and European stock markets jumped on Monday, with Hong Kong and Shanghai closing sharply higher and the yuan strengthening after months of trade-war turbulence. After being spooked by the conflict, investors returned to buying following the long-awaited meeting between the two presidents. But observers warned there were still major issues that needed to be resolved, including access for US companies and intellectual property protection. ""In order to really make a difference, China needs to enact more sweeping comprehensive reforms in the short term,"" Zarit said. China's state-run media cautiously welcomed the Buenos Aires agreement. The nationalist Global Times tabloid called it a ""momentous step forward"" that brings ""huge potential for fair trade"". ""It is hoped that the trade teams from both countries will reach as many practical agreements as possible and as quickly as possible to hasten China-US cooperation,"" the daily said. Under the agreement, Trump is shelving a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent from the start of next year - but the hike will kick in if negotiators fail to reach a final deal within 90 days. The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and they remain in effect despite the truce. China has hit back with similar tariffs on $110 billion worth of goods made in the US. ""No magic wand has been waved to make the differences between the United States and China vanish overnight,"" the state-run China Daily warned. ""Given the complexity of interactions between the two economies, the rest of the world will still be holding its collective breath while it waits to see if the series of constructive plans that are in the works can put bilateral relations back on a cooperative rather than confrontational track,"" it said."

China's President Xi Jinping listens to his Panamanian counterpart Juan Carlos Varela (not pictured) while delivering a joint message after a private meeting as part of Xi's first state visit to Panama, at Presidential Palace in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Portugal on Tuesday for a two-day visit to strengthen ties, amid concern in some EU capitals over China's growing influence on the continent. Fresh from a visit to Spain last week, his two-day stay in Portugal will include a meeting with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and the signing of cooperation agreements. One of them will bring the Portuguese port of Sines, in the southwest, into what China calls the ""new Silk Road"", an initiative that offers loans to build railways, roads and ports across Asia, Europe and Africa. In an op-ed published on Sunday in Portuguese newspapers, President Xi stressed the importance of China's relationship with Portugal as part of a broader network of trade links. But China's growing influence in Europe, welcomed by Greece and several eastern European countries, is viewed warily by others on the continent. At the initiative of France and Germany, EU countries last week agreed a framework regulating foreign investment, particularly from China. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Friday that Lisbon did not back the idea and was relieved that the final accord provided for only an advisory role on the part of the European Commission. Foreign investment does not worry Portugal, and the EU should not ""take the path of protectionism"" in the face of globalisation, he said. Portugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries, was open to Chinese investment after being hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis. Its 78 billion euro ($88 billion) EU-IMF rescue package in 2011 came with required austerity policies - and a wide-ranging privatisation programme that opened the doors to Chinese investment. Chinese investment accounted for 3.6 percent of Portugal's GDP between 2010 and 2016, according to figures from Spain's ESADE business school. China now owns a 28 percent stake in Portuguese energy utility EDP, the country's largest firm, via China Three Gorges and China's state-owned international investment company CNIC. It also has a stake in Portugal's biggest private bank, BCP, and its leading insurance company, Fidelidade. Seeking 'large-scale investment' Perhaps the most contentious issue is China Three Gorges' bid to take a controlling stake in EDP, of which it is already the main stakeholder. The operation, launched in May, involves some nine billion euros. But while it has been welcomed by the Portuguese government it still risks running foul of barriers imposed by regulators in around 15 countries where EDP operates - including the United States. Luis Castro Henriques, head of Portugal's trade and investment agency AICEP, says Chinese investment in Portugal has been good for the country. China has risen to Portugal's 11th-largest trade partner in the decade since 2008, when it was 28th on the list. ""We want now to attract large-scale industrial investment, notably in the automobile and agro-food sectors,"" Castro Henriques said."

China's President Xi Jinping speaks as he gives a joint statement to the press along with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela (out of frame) after holding a meeting, at the presidential palace in Panama City, on December 3, 2018. China said on Wednesday that Beijing and Washington will push forward with trade negotiations in the next 90 days and it is confident that an agreement can be reached, as doubts grow over whether the two sides can resolve their deep differences. The Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement on its website, also said China would work to implement specific issues already agreed upon as quickly as possible. The ministry's statement follows a period of relative quiet from Beijing after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. Scepticism on deal The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. But the mood has quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides will be able to reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period that was agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh US tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March. The Commerce Ministry said China-US trade and economic discussions were ""very successful"". The statement did not mention Trump or Xi, however, the state news agency Xinhua later said the ministry statement was hailing their meeting. ""We are confident in implementation...The economic and trade teams from both sides will actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map,"" it said. ""The Chinese side will start with implementing specifics on which there is already consensus, the faster the better."" Deal or tariffs Trump, via Twitter, threatened to place ""major tariffs"" on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. ""We are either going to have a real deal with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future,"" Trump wrote in a post within minutes of the Commerce Ministry statement. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the leaders' meeting, and there have been some differences between US and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails. A Chinese official told Reuters officials were ""waiting for the leaders to return"" before publicising details. President Xi Jinping and his most senior officials, including the commerce minister and the country's two top diplomats, are in Portugal, and due back in China on Thursday. US financial markets tumbled on Tuesday as doubts over what could realistically get accomplished in the tight negotiating window added to concerns about fading global growth."

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said US sanctions were ""economic terrorism"", as he sought to foster a united front from visiting regional officials on Saturday. Addressing parliament speakers from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey, Rouhani said they had all suffered economic pressure from the US. ""We are facing an all-out assault which is not only threatening our independence and identity but also is bent on breaking our longstanding ties,"" he said. The Trump administration in Washington has reimposed an oil embargo and other damaging sanctions on Iran since withdrawing in May from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers. ""America's unjust and illegal sanctions against the honourable nation of Iran have targeted our nation in a clear instance of terrorism,"" Rouhani said. ""Economic terrorism is designed to create panic in the economy of a country and fear in other countries in order to prevent investment."" The conference in Tehran was a second annual meeting of parliament speakers focused on terrorism and regional cooperation. The first was held last December in Islamabad. Most participating countries have faced harsh sanctions and other economic pressure as part of the Trump administration's use of trade as a diplomatic weapon. A brief truce in Trump's trade war with China was again in doubt this week after the arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who was detained in Canada to face fraud charges in the US. Washington has continued to pile fresh sanctions on Russia that began over its military intervention in Ukraine, while two Turkish ministers also faced temporary sanctions this year over the detention of an American pastor. 'We are all punished'  Trump has also cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, accusing it of failing to crack down on militancy. ""When they put pressure on China's trade, we are all harmed... By punishing Turkey, we are all punished. Any time they threaten Russia, we too consider our security to be endangered,"" Rouhani said. ""When they impose sanctions on Iran, they deprive all of us of the benefits of international trade, energy security and sustainable development. And in fact, they impose sanctions on everyone. ""We are here to say that we don't intend to tolerate such insolence."" Rouhani warned Europe - which has strongly objected to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal - that much is at stake in its efforts to bypass US sanctions and maintain trade with Iran. ""They should know that by sanctioning Iran, they would harm our ability to fight drugs and terrorism,"" Rouhani said, referring to Iran's efforts to combat smuggling, particularly from Afghanistan. The European Union is working on a payment system, known as the ""special purpose vehicle"", to keep money flowing into Iran, but has struggled to find a host since many countries fear repercussions from the Trump administration."

Michael Kovrig, an employee with the International Crisis Group and former Canadian diplomat appears in this photo provided by the International Crisis Group in Brussels, Belgium on December 11, 2018. A former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, two sources said on Tuesday, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release. Michael Kovrig's detention comes after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on December 1 at the request of US authorities, a move that has infuriated Beijing. It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China. ""International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its North East Asia Senior Adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,"" the think-tank said in a statement. ""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,"" it added. China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to questions faxed about Kovrig's detention. The exact reason for the detention, which was made sometime early this week, according to the sources, was not immediately clear. The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa. Calls to Kovrig's phones were not answered. Diplomatic spat Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017. From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Following Meng's arrest, China on Saturday summoned Canada's ambassador in Beijing and warned of severe ""consequences"" if Ottawa did not see that she was immediately released. Meng is set to return to a Vancouver courtroom on Tuesday, as the judge weighs final issues in determining whether she should be freed on bail while awaiting proceedings for her possible extradition to the United States. Washington has made accusations that Meng misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring severe penalties. Locked in a bitter trade war, Washington and Beijing earlier this month agreed to delay a planned January 1 increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, allowing more time to negotiate over China's huge bilateral trade surplus and US complaints that it steals technology. Chinese experts have said that Beijing was trying to separate Meng's arrest from the trade negotiations, but also warned that public anger in China over Canada's move could compel officials there to take measures that would further sour US-China ties and endanger talks. In 2014, a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, were detained a week after Canada accused China of hacking into the national computer system. Kevin Garratt was charged with spying, but released and deported after he spent two years in detention. "

The Chinese national flag flies in front of a Catholic church in the village of Huangtuang, Hebei province, China, September 30, 2018. A second bishop from China's 'underground' Catholic church is stepping aside and is being replaced by a government-backed clergyman, state-run media reported, amid a thaw in relations between Beijing and the Vatican. There are an estimated 10 million Catholics in China, divided between a government-run association whose clergy are approved by the Communist Party, and the unofficial church which answers to the Vatican. An agreement struck in September on the appointment of bishops has paved the way for a rapprochement between China and the Holy See, which cut off diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1951. Zhuang Jianjian, bishop of the Shantou diocese in southern China will retire and be replaced by Huang Bingzhang, deputy chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the Global Times reported. The Vatican-issued mandate was given to Huang last week by a delegation from Rome that met several Chinese bishops, the state-linked paper reported. ""The mission now is to unite Catholics in the diocese and reduce divergence so as to achieve the common goal of better serving church members,"" Huang told the Global Times. ""This doesn't come as a surprise because Zhuang Jianjian is already 88, so he would have wanted to retire more than a decade ago,"" said Anthony Lam, a Chinese Catholic church expert at Hong Kong's Holy Spirit Study Centre. According to canon laws that govern the Catholic church, bishops ""are requested"" to submit their resignation at the age of 75. The Catholic pope can either approve the resignation or request that they wait for a suitable successor to emerge, Lam said. ""The agreement between China and the Vatican has solved this problem because the seven bishops previously excommunicated have been restored to the church, so Huang Bingzhang will be able to take up the position."" The Vatican excommunicated Huang in 2011 for being ordained as a bishop without papal approval. This is a slightly different situation from that of fellow underground bishop Guo Xijin, who was last week asked to step aside in the eastern Fujian province to make way for government-approved clergy, Lam noted. Guo instead will serve as ""auxiliary bishop"" – someone who assists and works alongside the diocesan bishop – while both the unofficial and official churches of the diocese will merge. Guo's case was at the centre of last week's negotiations between China and the Vatican, which have been asking him to leave his post since 2017 to allow for talks aimed at ending their decades-old spat. Separately, the official church said it is facing a lack of bishops and called for ""politically reliable"" clergymen with ""good ethics,"" the Global Times reported on Wednesday. Nearly half of China's 98 Catholic dioceses have no leaders, chairman of the China Bishops Conference Ma Yinglin told a seminar, according to the paper."

Eight people were killed and 22 injured after a hijacked bus crashed into pedestrians in east China's Fujian province on Tuesday afternoon, state media reported. A hijacker carrying a knife had been detained and was being investigated by local police, state television CGTN reported. A video posted by Duowei news, a Chinese media outlet based in the US, showed several injured people lying on the street near a crashed bus.  It also showed police wrestling a person to the ground. Blood could also be seen on the steps of the bus, which had been stopped in the middle of a road. State-run news agency Xinhua reported the suspect was a 48-year-old local man surnamed Qiu. He had attacked a female passenger before taking control of the bus, Duowei reported. Police said that on the day of the attack the suspect had quarrelled with a local official who had visited his home, adding that the pair had a long history of conflict, according to the Xinhua report. The 22 wounded in the attack were taken to local hospitals, with one person being treated for ""serious injures"", Xinhua said. Spate of attacks China has suffered a spate of similar incidents this year. In late November, a car ploughed into a group of children crossing a street in front of an elementary school in the northeastern Liaoning province, killing five people and injuring at least 19. The driver said he ""chose his victims at random"" and had reportedly been contemplating suicide due to domestic troubles before the tragedy occurred. In October, three people were killed when a man fleeing after committing a stabbing drove into a crowd and attacked onlookers in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The month before, a man ploughed a truck into a crowd in Hunan province and went on a rampage, attacking onlookers with knives and a shovel. Eleven died and 44 were injured. Grisly car accidents are common in China, where transportation authorities have struggled to uphold safety regulations – which are often flouted or go unenforced. According to authorities 58,000 people were killed in accidents across the country in 2015 alone. Last month, at least 13 people died when a bus plunged off a bridge in Chongqing municipality, after the driver got into a fist fight with a passenger who had missed her bus stop. Search and rescue teams dispatched more than 70 boats, as well as a team of scuba divers and underwater robots, to find the wreckage and retrieve bodies from the water."

A plainclothes police officer stands outside the courthouse where prominent rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang is being tried in Tianjin, China December 26, 2018. Chinese police locked down a courthouse on Wednesday at the start of the trial of a prominent rights lawyer who is accused of inciting subversion of state power and whose case has attracted widespread concern in Western capitals. Wang Quanzhang, who took on sensitive cases of complaints of police torture and defended practitioners of the banned Falun Gong cult, went missing in August 2015 during a sweeping crackdown on rights activists. Most cases from that summer, known as the 709 cases for the first day of detentions on July 9, 2015, have concluded. Wang, however, was incommunicado for more than 1,000 days. An investigation said he had ""for a long time been influenced by infiltrating anti-China forces"" and had been trained by overseas groups and accepted their funding, according to a copy of the indictment seen by Reuters. Police outside the court in the northern city of Tianjin told reporters they could not get near the building because it was a closed trial. One supporter stood outside the courthouse shouting ""Wang Quanzhang is a good person"" and ""I support Wang Quanzhang"" before police forced him into a car and drove him away. There were also several Western diplomats outside the courthouse, who were likewise not allowed in. The indictment says Wang worked with Peter Dahlin, a Swedish rights worker who was detained in China for three weeks before being deported in 2016, and others to ""train hostile forces"", as well as actively providing investigative reports overseas. It also says Wang had hyped up and distorted the facts in his online statements about the case of a policeman who killed a petitioner in Heilongjiang in 2014 and of ""cults"" that he had defended. Dahlin, now in Madrid, said on Twitter they had kept all documentation dating back to 2009 ""and will release anything needed to dispel that it constitutes subverting state power."" Calls to the court seeking comment went unanswered. The trial could last just a single day, although a verdict may not come immediately. Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, says she has been unable to visit her husband since he went missing. She said seven lawyers she appointed to try to represent Wang had also been unable to visit him. Li said in a statement sent to Reuters state security agents had followed her when she left her Beijing home and blocked off the six entrances to her compound. She decided she would be unable to go to Tianjin after more than an hour spent trying to leave, she said. It was not possible to reach the State Security Ministry for comment because it has no website or publicly available telephone number. Chinese President Xi Jinping has strengthened efforts to quash dissent since coming to power six years ago, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained and dozens jailed. China routinely rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record, saying all Chinese are treated equally in accordance with the law and that foreign countries have no right to interfere. Doriane Lau, China researcher at Amnesty International, earlier this week raised questions about the timing of the trial on December 26, saying: ""We think this is deliberate because obviously a big part of the world will be having a holiday and will not be able to respond."""

and that his collaboration with Guo's company were ""particularly
serious"". Ma had used his position to conspire with Guo and to help
businesses Guo controlled by using threats to bring about
illegal transactions such as compelling individuals to transfer
company shares, the court said. Ma had received more than $14.56 million (100 million yuan)
in property for his work and earned nearly 5 million yuan from
trading stocks based on insider information, the court said. Ma said that he accepted the ruling and would not appeal,
according to the court said. It was not possible to contact Ma for comment. Guo could not
immediately be reached for comment. Ma was put under investigation for corruption in 2015 and
expelled from the Communist Party the following year after
prosecutors accused him of interfering in unspecified law
enforcement activities. Dozens of senior officials have been investigated or jailed
since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, vowing to root
out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the
Communist Party’s grip on power. The powerful state security ministry spies on its citizens

the most opaque agencies in China and does not have a public

As a partial shutdown of the US government entered its eighth day, with no quick end in sight, the Republican president was in Washington, sending out tweets attacking Democrats and talking up possibly improved relations with China. The two nations have been in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies has been disrupted by tariffs. Trump and Xi agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war, deciding to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting December 1 while they negotiate a deal to end the dispute following months of escalating tensions. Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! Chinese state media also said Xi and Trump spoke on Saturday and quoted Xi as saying that teams from both countries have been working to implement a consensus reached with Trump. ""I hope that the two teams will meet each other halfway, work hard, and strive to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial and beneficial to the world as soon as possible,"" Xi said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.

Billions of dollars of losses  The US-China trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018, hitting industries including automobiles, technology - and above all, agriculture. The losses may give US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, motivation to resolve their trade differences before a March 2 deadline, although talks between the economic superpowers could still devolve."

Xinhua said Vice Premier Liu He will hold talks with Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. A lower-level round of talks between the US and China will take place in Washington on Tuesday, the White House said on Monday. The talks follow a round of negotiations that ended in Beijing last week without a deal but which officials said had generated progress on contentious issues between the world's two largest economies. The talks are aimed at ""achieving needed structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China. The two sides will also discuss China's pledge to purchase a substantial amount of goods and services from the United States,"" the White House said in a statement. Both governments have expressed optimism but they have given no details of their talks. Economists say the time available for negotiations is too brief to resolve an array of irritants in US-Chinese relations. They say Beijing's goal is to persuade President Donald Trump they are making enough progress to push back threatened US penalties. Beijing hopes for ""a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement that is acceptable to both sides,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. The talks on Thursday will be led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a strong proponent of pressing China to end practices that the US says include forced technology transfers from US companies and intellectual property theft. The White House said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and trade adviser Peter Navarro would also take part in the talks. US tariffs on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1. Trump, who suggested last week that he could extend the deadline for the talks, reiterated in a speech on Monday that the negotiations had been fruitful. ""We're making a lot of progress.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/slowly-but-surely-china-is-moving-into-afghanistan-12715872,"Slowly but surely, China is moving into Afghanistan","As the war in Afghanistan winds down, China looks to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.",6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"As the war in Afghanistan winds down, China looks to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.  In 2013, Chinese president Xi Jinping inaugurated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vast network of infrastructure projects spanning more than 60 countries. But the BRI largely excludes Afghanistan, moving through Central Asia and Pakistan instead. That may now be changing. China has steadily increased its involvement in Afghanistan in recent years, and a nascent peace process offers some hope that stability might return to the country, bringing with it the possibility of greater trade and investment. This shift is reflected in a major new report on the BRI’s expansion into Afghanistan by the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies (DROPS), a Kabul-based think tank. The 15-month research project has amassed a vast amount of material gleaned from multiple sources, including previously undisclosed government documents and interviews with high-ranking Afghan officials, making it by far the most comprehensive treatment of Afghanistan’s potential role in the BRI to date. “Looking at the BRI map, it seemed that it was bypassing Afghanistan,” said Mariam Safi, Director of DROPS and one of the report’s co-authors. “So, we wanted to know if there is any thinking in the Afghan government and stakeholders here on the BRI when it comes to Afghanistan’s potential linkage”. Afghanistan should fit well into the BRI. It has a serious infrastructure deficit, making it an ideal candidate for Chinese investment. It is also the shortest route between Central Asia and South Asia, and between China and the Middle East, while also serving as a gateway to the Arabian Sea. But China’s role in Afghanistan in the past two decades has been limited. It did not contribute troops to the US-led war that began in 2001, and Beijing has so far refrained from the sorts of big-ticket investments planned for other neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Kazakhstan. But its economic footprint has expanded. China is now Afghanistan’s largest business investor, it has pledged increasing amounts of aid to the country, and Chinese companies have been involved in construction projects. Beijing has also shown some interest in Afghanistan’s cornucopia of natural resources, which includes vast deposits of essential minerals such as lithium (used in mobile phone batteries). The country’s weak logistics and security situation make it difficult to extract and transport these resources. But China has got its foot in the door, winning rights to Amu Darya Basin oil in the north and the massive Mes Aynak copper mine near Kabul. Moreover, Beijing has taken modest steps to include Afghanistan in the BRI. In 2016 Beijing and Kabul signed a Memorandum of Understanding. China has reportedly pledged at least $100 million in funding. However, this is a tiny amount compared to the vast sums proposed for other countries, like Pakistan. And, according to Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), “We still don’t see large projects going forward that quickly on the ground.” But there has been some progress. In September 2016, for example, the first direct freight train from China reached the Afghan border town of Hairatan. An air corridor linking Kabul and the Chinese city of Urumqi has also been launched under the BRI. Then, in May 2017, Afghan officials attended the massive Belt and Road Forum in China, and in October Afghanistan joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which funds BRI projects. Kabul has made connectivity a key pillar of its foreign policy, launching various infrastructure projects that could eventually be “brought under the BRI fold,” Mariam Safi tells TRT World. Reluctant bedfellows  One such initiative is the Five Nations Railway running from China to Iran via Afghanistan, which is still at the feasibility study stage but aligns well with Beijing’s priorities in the Belt and Road. Another is a planned north-south railway corridor that would connect Kunduz with Torkham on the Pakistani border. Afghanistan has bold plans to expand its almost non-existent railway network. According to internal Afghan government documents reviewed by DROPS, China has pledged “huge support” for these efforts. The north-south railway could facilitate the transport of natural resources while also connecting to Pakistan.  Furthermore, there are various energy projects which could fit well into the Belt and Road vision, such as CASA-1000 and TAP-500 that would export surplus electricity from Central Asia to energy-starved South Asia via Afghanistan, or the TAPI gas pipeline, whose Afghan segment began construction last year (although there is reason to doubt its progress). Another project that could be included in BRI is the Digital Silk Road fibre optic cable network, funded by China, the US and other partners, which has already connected at least 25 provinces in Afghanistan while aiming to link to China, South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, according to DROPS. China has generally eschewed a leadership role in Afghanistan, preferring to work with foreign partners. Some projects, including the Five Nations Railway and Lapis Lazuli Corridor, are jointly financed by China and multilateral lending institutions such as the ADB. “There has been a lot of cooperative activity on the ground,” Raffaello Pantucci told TRT World, and Beijing seems to view Afghanistan as a place where it can “test out” difficult relationships. China has collaborated with the US there, despite tensions between the two countries, and recently agreed to cooperate with its rival, India. Sino-Indian efforts in Afghanistan face a hurdle, though, in the form of Beijing’s close relationship with Delhi’s nemesis, Pakistan. 2015 saw the inauguration of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a vast energy and infrastructure project involving more than $60 billion of potential investment. CPEC was intended to be the Belt and Road’s “flagship” corridor, and, as such, it is already more advanced than other components of the BRI. According to the report, CPEC is “one of the most feasible options” for integrating Afghanistan into the BRI. There are some cross-border rail and road links at varying stages of development. While none of these is near completion, China clearly wants to move forward. In 2017 Beijing convened a trilateral dialogue with Pakistan and Afghanistan partly to discuss extending CPEC, but also to ameliorate the rocky relationship between its two neighbours, which has seen border closures and skirmishes. These efforts paid off, as Afghan-Pakistani relations improved in 2018, with a new cooperation agreement in May. Afghan officials interviewed by DROPS were generally “positive” about CPEC, the report says, but some were wary of excessive dependence on Pakistan. Indeed, as relations with Islamabad soured in recent years, Kabul has diversified its trade away from Pakistan to Iran. However, the officials were clear “across the board” that Afghanistan still needs Pakistan because it provides the quickest route to the sea, according to Mariam Safi. And, vice versa, Pakistan hopes that Afghanistan may eventually provide access to Central Asian markets. “At the end of the day there was the realisation that both countries need each other,” Safi told TRT World. Neither the Afghan nor Pakistani governments responded to requests for comment. Increasing Chinese footprint While China’s economic role in Afghanistan has increased, its security presence has grown even more. As the US started withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in 2011, the country became increasingly unstable, raising the risk that insecurity would spill out into Central Asia and Pakistan, potentially disrupting China’s Belt and Road projects there. Beijing has also been concerned about what they call the threat posed by Uighur and other terrorists using Afghanistan as a base for attacks against the Chinese mainland. In response, China has intensified security on its border, reportedly engaging in joint patrols with Afghan forces and building a base in Badakhshan province, while also launching the Quadrilateral Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism (QCCM) with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan. To counter instability in Afghanistan, China has also stepped up its involvement in peace talks to end the war. Since 2015, it has been involved in a number of multilateral initiatives, including the Quadrilateral Coordination Group and, more recently, the Moscow Format. Beijing has cultivated good ties with the Taliban, meeting them several times in 2018 alone. Peace may now be on the horizon. The Trump administration has made unprecedented progress in its efforts to negotiate with the Taliban, reaching a provisional agreement in January. The Afghan government still needs to join the talks, however, and there is a long road ahead. For Beijing, peace would not only reduce the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan, but it could also boost Chinese economic activity. “Afghanistan has been peripheral to the Belt and Road because it simply hasn’t been possible to pursue a serious economic agenda there,” said Andrew Small, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the US and author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics. “If there is a political settlement, that could change – though China will still tread very carefully until it’s clear that any settlement holds.” At the launch of the DROPS report in January, Beijing’s new ambassador to Kabul, Liu Jinsong, said that China was facilitating peace talks to enable Afghanistan’s integration into the BRI, describing the country as a “vital partner” in the initiative. The appointment of Mr Jinsong, a former director of the Silk Road Fund, “shows that Beijing now considers Afghanistan a priority and wants to include it firmly in its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),” according to the Berlin-based thinktank, MERICS. While there is still a long way to go, Beijing is entering a new phase of engagement with its neighbour. “It is certainly true that China is playing a much greater (and higher profile) role in Afghanistan,” said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at the University of Oxford, whose latest book, The New Silk Roads, examines emerging forms of connectivity in Asia. “My best guess is that this really is a case of a new page being turned,” Frankopan told TRT World.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen during the New Year press conference in Taipei, Taiwan. January 1, 2019. Taiwan will not accept any deal that destroys its sovereignty and democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday after the island's opposition KMT party said it could sign a peace deal with China if it wins a presidential election next year. China claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island, which it regards as sacred territory, under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. While China has not broached the idea of a peace deal in years, the chairman of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), Wu Den-yih, said last week the party could sign a peace deal with China if it won the hotly contested election. ""Taiwan society will not accept any treaty that harms Taiwan's national sovereignty and democracy,"" Tsai told reporters in Taipei. She said there won't be real peace unless China rules out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing was expected to make fresh overtures to the KMT ahead of the elections, security sources in Taiwan's government familiar with the matter told Reuters, a move they said could isolate Tsai's government and sway the election results. Losing out in polls Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party suffered stinging losses to the KMT in mayoral and local elections in November. Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo, has said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect Taipei's democratic values. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies. Tsai has repeatedly called for international support to defend Taiwan's democracy and way of life in the face of China's renewed threats. "

In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before proceeding to their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Friday, February 22, 2019. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented a $10 billion deal for a refining and petrochemical complex in China on Friday, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping who urged joint efforts to counter extremism and terror. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, arrived on Thursday on an Asia tour that has already seen the kingdom pledged investment of $20 billion in Pakistan and seek to make additional investments in India's refining industry. ""China is a good friend and partner to Saudi Arabia,"" President Xi Jinping told the crown prince in front of reporters. ""The special nature of our bilateral relationship reflects the efforts you have made,"" added Xi, who has made stepping up China's presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia's relations with China dated back ""a very long time in the past."" ""In the hundreds, even thousands, of years, the interactions between the sides have been friendly. Over such a long period of exchanges with China, we have never experienced any problems with China,"" he said. Crown Prince Mohammed, who has come under fire in the West following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October, said Saudi Arabia saw great opportunities with China. ""The Silk Road initiative and China's strategic orientation are very much in line with the kingdom's Vision 2030,"" he said according to SPA, referring to Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform programme. Trade between the countries increased by 32 percent last year, he said. Saudi Arabia also said it was working to add Chinese to the curriculum in Saudi schools and universities. ""The introduction of Chinese to the curriculum is an important step towards the opening of new horizons for students,"" the government said in a statement. China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh, since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi Arabia's regional foe, Iran. China is also wary of criticism from Muslim countries about its camps in the heavily Muslim far western region of Xinjiang, which the government says are for de-radicalisation purposes and rights groups call internment camps. Xi told the crown prince the two countries must strengthen international cooperation on de-radicalisation to ""prevent the infiltration and spread of extremist thinking,"" Chinese state TV reported. Saudi Arabia respected and supported China's right to protect its own security and take counterterror and de-radicalisation steps, the crown prince told Xi, according to the same report, and was willing to increase cooperation. Meeting the crown prince earlier on Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said the two countries should enhance exchanges on their experiences in de-radicalisation, China's official Xinhua news agency said in a separate report. Chinese state media made no direct mention of Xinjiang in their stories on the crown prince's meetings. Deals signed Aramco agreed to form a joint venture with Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in the northeastern Chinese city of Panjin, saying the project was worth more than $10 billion. The partners would form a company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Co as part of a project that would include a 300,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery with a 1.5-million-metric tonnes per year ethylene cracker, Aramco said. Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the crude feedstock for the complex, which is expected to start operations in 2024. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, a position Russia has held for the last three years. Saudi Aramco is set to boost market share by signing supply deals with non-state Chinese refiners. Aramco also signed an agreement to buy a nine percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, Saudi state news agency SPA said . This formalised a previously announced plan to gain a stake in a 400,000-bpd refinery and petrochemicals complex in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai. China sees ""enormous potential"" in Saudi Arabia's economy and wants more high-tech cooperation, State Councillor Wang Yi, the Chinese government's top diplomat, said on Thursday. But China was not seeking to play politics in the Middle East, the widely read state-run tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial. ""China won't be a geopolitical player in the Middle East. It has no enemies and can cooperate with all countries in the region,"" said the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily. ""China's increasing influence in the Middle East comes from pure friendly cooperation. Such a partnership will be welcomed by more countries in the Middle East."""

Flags fly as members of Egyptian security forces stand guard before the start of a summit between Arab league and European Union member states, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, February 24, 2019. Leaders from European Union and Arab League countries pledged on Sunday to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to tackle unauthorised migration at a first-ever summit high in symbolism but likely to yield few concrete results. Under tight security at the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi opened two days of talks with a speech celebrating what he described as historic cooperation between the two organizations. But despite the public display of unity, just drafting a summit statement has proved difficult.  EU and Arab League foreign ministers failed to agree earlier this month on a text after Hungary objected to the section on migration. Europe's migration challenge is at the heart of the two-day meeting, being held under the slogan ""Investing in Stability.""  Desperate to bring migrant arrivals under control, the EU offered the summit last October as a symbolic sweetener to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi. What EU wants from Sisi The EU wants Sisi to order the Egyptian coast guard to pick up migrants leaving Libya and take them back to the African mainland, ensuring they do not become Europe's responsibility. Sissi, in turn, receives high-profile European recognition, promotion for Sharm el Sheikh, and is likely to avoid any lessons on human rights. While the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean has now dropped to a seven-year low, Europe's inability to agree on how to manage the arrivals has sparked a major political crisis, as nations bicker over who should take responsibility and whether other EU partners should help out.  Some, like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary, claim that extremists are entering among the refugees. Praises for Egypt  Just days before the summit, the head of the EU's border and coast guard agency praised the authorities in Cairo for preventing any migrant from setting out for Europe from the Egyptian coast since 2016. ""There are no boats coming directly from Egypt to the European Union,"" Frontex director Fabrice Leggeri said. ""The cooperation with Egypt is really encouraging and is developing."" The EU routinely trumpets an agreement it reached with Turkey for slowing migrant arrivals to a trickle in exchange for up to 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in aid for Syrian refugees there and other incentives. It has pledged to replicate the deal in northern Africa. Ahead of this inaugural summit, experts and European officials played down any expectation of major results. Important timing ""The timing is very important because it comes after eight years of instability in the Mediterranean affecting Europe and the Middle East,"" Saeed Sadek, professor of political sociology at the Canadian University in Cairo told The Associated Press. ""Both sides want to know how can we stabilise the area further, produce stability, how can we deal with the consequences and prevent any further escalations,"" said Sadek. ""But the imbalance of power between the two sides may not produce the concrete results that people imagine."" May to seek Saudi influence in Yemen British Prime Minister Theresa May will call on Saudi Arabia's King Salman to use his influence to encourage Yemeni parties towards peace, telling a summit that governments must redouble efforts to secure a political settlement to the crisis. ""My message in Sharm el Sheikh is clear: let us now redouble our efforts to build on the progress made and get the Stockholm agreements implemented in full,"" May said on the way to the EU-League of Arab states summit in Egypt. ""I will also use this summit to reiterate to King Salman the importance of Saudi Arabia continuing to use their influence to encourage the Yemeni parties towards peace, as they did so pivotally in Stockholm. And I will underline the UK's ongoing commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia and the region."" The war in Yemen has largely been stalemated for years, with a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states and Yemeni allies unable to dislodge the Houthi movement that controls the capital and most major population centres. A ceasefire was agreed at talks at a castle near Stockholm last month.  The agreement also foresees a political track of talks to end the war. But a lack of progress could test the patience of the United Arab Emirates, which leads military operations on Yemen's Red Sea coast for the Saudi-led coalition"

(January 30, 2019) US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will extend a deadline to escalate tariffs on Chinese imports, citing ""substantial progress"" in weekend talks between the two countries. Trump tweeted that there had been ""productive talks,"" adding that ""I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1."" I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues.

Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. & China! Trump said that if negotiations progress, he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida resort to finalise an agreement. Speaking to governors gathered at the White House for an annual black-tie ball on Sunday, Trump said he was doing ""very well"" with China. ""If all works well we're going to have some very big news over the next week or two,"" he said, though he took care to add that ""we still have a little ways to go."" The reprieve is likely to be greeted with relief by financial markets. US and Chinese negotiators met through the weekend as they seek to resolve a trade war that has rattled financial markets. Trump had warned he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on $200 billion in Chinese imports, from 10 to 25 percent, if the two sides failed to reach a deal. The increase was scheduled to take effect at 12:01 am EST (05:01 GMT) on March 2. Kate Fisher has more from Washington DC. Mounting pressure The world's two biggest economies have been locked in a conflict over US allegations that China steals technology and forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in an aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance. The two counties have slapped import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods. The conflict has shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy, putting pressure on Trump and Xi to reach a deal. ""Trump clearly wants a deal and so do the Chinese, which certainly raises the probability that the two sides will come to some sort of negotiated agreement, even if it is a partial one, in the coming weeks,"" said Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. But business groups and lawmakers in Congress want to see a comprehensive deal that forces the Chinese to change their behaviour and can be enforced."

Ethnic Uighur demonstrators hold portraits of their relatives reportedly missing, during a demonstration against China in Istanbul, Turkey, February 23, 2019. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu voiced concern on Monday at China's alleged mistreatment of Uighurs and other Muslims in the East Turkistan region.  He also called for authorities to protect freedom of religion and cultural identity. Without specifically mentioning mass detention camps reported to hold one million Muslims – which China says are centres for vocational education – Cavusoglu told the UN Human Rights Council [UNHRC] that ""reports regarding human rights violations against Uighurs and other Muslim communities in East Turkistan are serious cause for concern."" ""We encourage Chinese authorities and expect that universal human rights, including freedom of religion, are respected and full protection of the cultural identities of the Uighurs and other Muslims is ensured,"" he told the Geneva forum. China has rejected all accusations of mistreatment in the camps. A distinction should be made between ""terrorists and innocent people,"" Cavusoglu said, adding, ""And I have to underline that we support the One China policy."" Discrimination  The East Turkistan region is home to around 10 million Uighurs.  The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of the region's population, has long accused Chinese authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. Up to one million people, or about seven percent of the Muslim population in the East Turkistan region, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of ""political re-education"" camps, according to US officials and UN experts. Families of missing Uighurs speak out Nearly two years after the Chinese government began to detain members of Muslim minority groups in western China, a growing number of family members abroad are refusing to remain silent. On Sunday, about three dozen relatives of some of the Uighurs, Kazakhs and others being held without charge, spoke out about the mass detentions at an event in Washington, DC, hoping to raise awareness of what many are calling a human rights travesty. ""If you know someone who is missing, it is time to speak up,"" said Ferkat Jawdat, a Virginia-based software engineer. He's lost contact with his 52-year-old mother in East Turkistan. For members of the Uighur diaspora, losing a family member into the sprawling system has become all too common. Jawdat co-organised Sunday's gathering so that Uighurs in the US could start collecting information on their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and even children whose whereabouts are unknown.  They plan to present the data to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the US State Department. Raising awareness  Some of the attendees have confirmation that their loved ones are detained in East Turkistan. Others have simply lost contact — and fear the worst. ""We want to raise awareness about what can happen to American families — many of these people here are American citizens,"" said Jawdat, a US citizen who helped organise the event, held in the basement of a public library. Similar gatherings took place concurrently in eight other countries, including Turkey, France, Germany, Australia and Canada."

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would consider extending the deadline for a trade deal with China beyond March 1. ""If we're close to a deal, where we think we can make a real deal... I could see myself letting that slide for a little while,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. But he added: ""Generally speaking I'm not inclined to do that."" The comments came as the third round of trade negotiations were set to resume in Beijing to avert more than doubling tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. ""China wants to make a deal very badly,"" he said, and ""things are going well"" in the talks. And while no date has yet been agreed for a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, he said he expects that to happen ""at some point."" The high-stakes dispute has raised concerns it could spill over into the global economy after Trump last year hit China with 25 percent punitive tariffs on $50 billion in goods, and then imposed 10 percent duties on another $200 billion in annual imports. The rate on all those imports are set to increase to 25 percent if no agreement is reached by March 1. China's economy already has shown signs of slowing, while the trade war has shaken the confidence of US businesses, as retaliatory tariffs have raised prices and helped choke off a key export market. And Trump's aggressive strategy has failed to produce a reduction in the US trade deficit with China, which he set as a primary goal. He repeated the incorrect statement that China is paying the duties, which in fact are paid by US companies importing goods. And economists say much of the intended effect of the duties in reducing imports, has been offset by the devaluation of China's currency, which makes goods cheaper for importers."

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laughs as he attends a meeting with Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs (not pictured) in the ministry building in Budapest, Hungary, February 11, 2019. When US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary this week to shore up long-standing relations, he also came with a warning for his NATO partners; that they are the targets of a campaign by Russia and China to divide the West. Arriving in Bratislava yesterday, Pompeo reminded Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajack of his country’s history of oppression under four decades of communism and “the aggressive role Russia continues to play in the region”. Invoking Russia’s annexation of Crimea, he encouraged Central Europe to embrace closer defence ties with the US and to become more aware of political manipulation from Moscow. “Russia and China are authoritarian powers who do not share our joint aspirations of freedom,” he said during a joint news conference in Budapest on Monday with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Poland and Hungary in particular are seen as increasingly undemocratic countries with right-wing governments that have cosied up to Russia and China in recent years. Earlier this month, Washington-based think tank Freedom House downgraded Hungary from ""free"" to ""partly free"" in its annual freedom survey, making it the only EU country in that category. ""We must not let Putin drive wedges between friends in NATO,"" Pompeo continued. In the first visit by a US secretary of state in eight years, Pompeo placed part of the blame on the US and its absence from the region. “Secretary Pompeo needs to treat this trip not as a friendly meeting between allies, but as an opportunity to have a frank conversation with a state increasingly at odds with both American interests and its human rights obligations,” Human Rights First said in a statement. While Hungary would go on to sign a defence cooperation agreement with the US on Monday, as well as agreeing to buy US military equipment, the trip would not come without tension, with Szijjarto stating that Budapest has grown tired of the West’s “enormous hypocrisy” with regards to Russia. At the same time, Pompeo managed to raise eyebrows by stating a US intention to fight corruption and strengthen support for independent media in all the Visegrad Four (V4) countries. Each of the V4 countries (the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary) have been accused of large-scale government corruption in recent years, while Hungary and Poland in particular have decimated media outlets that are critical of the government. “If you look at the Hungarian media, the independents are against the rightist government – they have labelled them as socialist-liberal – so [in the new US position] there is certainly an ideological underpinning,” Balazs Jarabik, a nonresident scholar of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Europe think-tank, told TRT World. He said that while the US would most likely focus on countering a mass anti-EU disinformation campaign perpetrated by Moscow in recent years, it was nonetheless inappropriate for them to tamper with the media landscape of sovereign countries. “Yes, the Hungarian government controls most of the media, about 60 percent, but does not control the public opinion. Whether it is the job of the Americans to strengthen independent media, I don’t think so,” he said. In Hungary on Monday, Pompeo also warned Europe that using technology from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei could hurt their relationship with the United States, adding that it has an obligation to alert other governments to the risks of building networks with equipment from the mobile operator. His statement comes amid the latest efforts to push Huawei out of lucrative fifth generation (5G) contracts around the world over what it believes to be serious security threats. Despite security concerns, Hungary and Slovakia have remained in Huawei’s corner, saying the company does not pose such a threat in their countries. Jarabik said Pompeo’s statement has more to do with protecting American business interests in a region that has been increasingly looking elsewhere. “This is a part of selling American. Pompeo and the Americans have proved to be a very effective salesmen and this is all about that,” he said."

A super typhoon made landfall in China's Guangdong on Sunday, the country's most populous province, after wreaking havoc in Hong Kong and Macau and killing at least 69 people in the Philippines, with two additional deaths reported in China.  Packing gale force winds of more than 200 kph, tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year, equivalent to a maximum Category 5 ""intense hurricane"" in the Atlantic. The eye of Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia's mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 km south of Hong Kong but the former British colony was still caught in the typhoon's swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds. Buried in mud Typhoon Mangkhut lashed the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain that caused landslides feared to have buried dozens.  Landslides caused by the pounding storm hit two villages in Itogon town in the Philippine mountain province of Benguet. Police Superintendent Pelita Tacio said 34 villagers had died and 36 were missing. The rescue work halted for the night before resuming Monday morning.

Arabella Munro has more.  Philippine death toll feared to rise In the Philippines, casualties reported by various agencies on Sunday evening indicate the death toll from the impact of Mangkhut could exceed 50, with most killed in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region. Francis Tolentino, an advisor to President Rodrigo Duterte and head of the government's disaster coordination, said the latest number of casualties was 33 dead and 56 missing. TRT World's Natasha Hussain reports. But the head of the military's Northern Luzon Command, Emmanuel Salamat, told Reuters that at least 19 more were killed in landslides in one part of Benguet province. The 19 who died were part of a bigger group of 43 people, likely miners, and those who were still alive were feared to be trapped in an old mining bunkhouse that had collapsed under rubble, according to Tolentino. Search and rescue missions were ongoing, and a local mayor in Benguet, Victorio Palangdan, said he feared the number killed there could be more than 100. Separately, the coastguard said it had recovered the bodies of three people. In Macau, which halted casino gambling late on Saturday and put China's People's Liberation Army on standby for disaster relief help, some streets were flooded. ""The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,"" said authorities in the world's largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage. Earlier, TRT World spoke to Hong Kong-based journalist Patrick Fok for more details. ""King of storms"" The typhoon, dubbed the ""King of Storms"" by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5:00 pm. local time, packing winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), weather officials said. Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas were also reduced as a precaution. In Shenzhen, electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday. The storm has fuelled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output, at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop. Guangdong is also China's most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million. The airport in the boomtown of Shenzhen has been shut since midnight, and will be closed until 8:00 am. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have been cancelled in Guangzhou and the neighbouring island province of Hainan. High winds and swells have also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 metres (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. Mangkhut's northwesterly track will bring heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday, before it weakens into a tropical depression to reach southwestern Yunnan next day."

The spontaneous fracturing of rock — a kind of earthquake induced by excavation — took place around 11 pm Saturday in Shandong province.  Part of a water drainage tunnel was destroyed in the burst, Xinhua said, and two people were killed by fractured rocks that fell in the tunnel. More than 300 people were working inside the mine at the time. Most have been successfully lifted to safety, while 20 remain trapped underground. The incident ""has nothing to do with workers' operations,"" an official with the Shandong Coal Mine Safety Supervision Bureau told The Associated Press by phone. The official, surnamed Tian, said nearly 140 rescuers were dispatched. Ventilation has returned to around 200 metres (656 feet) of the damaged tunnel, Xinhua said. The cause of the accident was being investigated."

China's President Xi Jinping attends the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge at the Zhuhai Port terminal on October 23, 2018. China’s President Xi Jinping launched the world’s longest sea bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China Tuesday at a time when Beijing is tightening its grip on its semi-autonomous territories. Xi announced the bridge officially open at a ceremony also attended by Hong Kong’s and Macau’s city leaders at a new port terminal in the southern mainland city of Zhuhai. “I declare the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge officially open,” Xi said as digital fireworks exploded on a screen behind him in an indoor ceremony, before leaving the stage immediately. He did not address the audience. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam had earlier spoken to thank Xi for attending in person, praising the bridge’s “magnificence”. It is the second major infrastructure project tying Hong Kong to mainland China to launch in a matter of weeks, after the opening of a high-speed rail link last month, and is part of a Beijing-driven strategy to create a sprawling “Greater Bay Area” economic hub. Critics say the new multi-billion-dollar sea-bridge is one more way to integrate Hong Kong into China as fears grow that the city’s cherished freedoms are being eroded. The mega bridge will open to traffic on Wednesday. Building began in 2009 and has been dogged by delays, budget overruns, corruption prosecutions and the deaths of construction workers. The launch ceremony was hastily announced last week by mainland authorities with Hong Kong lawmakers and transport companies complaining they had been left in the dark. Supporters of the project promote it as an engineering marvel that will also boost business and cut travel time, while others see it as a politically driven and costly white elephant. The main bridge section is considered mainland territory and Hong Kong cars and drivers travelling over it “must comply with the laws and regulations of the mainland”, according to the city’s transport department. ""It’s magnificent"" There was no ceremony on the Hong Kong side Tuesday, but there was a heightened police presence in coastal areas near the bridge, with officers carrying out identity checks on journalists and members of the public. Hong Kong residents will only be granted a licence to cross into Zhuhai by car if they meet highly selective criteria, including holding certain mainland government positions or making major contributions to charities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Most people will need to travel the bridge on coaches and buses. Online commenters in Hong Kong complained about the bridge’s restricted access ahead of the launch. “Such a huge investment using the Hong Kong taxpayer’s money... yet basically it is not open to us at all,” said one comment on the South China Morning Post website. But residents in Zhuhai welcomed the bridge. “I think this bridge will bring great convenience to the whole area of Zhuhai, Hong Kong and Macao, and promote the economic development of the whole area of the Pearl River Delta,” resident Dang Zheiliang told AFP. Resident Can Binghua paid a visit to the bridge on his day off. “Today I’m off duty, so I took my child to see the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Now it’s almost open to traffic. It’s magnificent,” he told AFP. Some Hong Kong media reported that the physical condition of bus drivers would be monitored by cameras, including an alert sent if a driver yawns more than three times in 20 seconds. China already lays claim to the record for the world’s longest bridge of any kind — the Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge, a viaduct which is part of a high-speed rail line. The opening of the high-speed rail link last month also sparked criticism as it saw Chinese security stationed on Hong Kong soil for the first time at the city’s terminus. Critics accused the Hong Kong government of giving away territory to an increasingly assertive Beijing."

China's Premier Li Keqiang (L) gestures as he speaks with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as they arrive to pose for a family photograph during an ASEM summit at the European Council in Brussels on October 19, 2018. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe makes a rare trip to China on Thursday hoping improved relations will lead to new economic partnerships, as the two countries come under US pressure on trade. The visit is the first by a Japanese premier since 2011 and is part of a years-long process of repairing ties in the wake of a disastrous falling-out in 2012, when Tokyo “nationalised” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. The incident prompted anti-Japanese riots in China, and kicked off a frosty spell that has only gradually and recently begun to thaw. TRT World's Samantha Vadas reports. Since an awkward 2014 encounter between Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit, there have been ministerial visits by both sides and a softening of rhetoric. But Abe’s trip will be a test of how far the two countries have come, and the need for progress is all the more urgent as US President Donald Trump levies tariffs and rattles sabres on trade with both China and Japan. “The trade war with the US seems like it’s helping bring them together a bit,” said Kristin Vekasi, assistant professor of political science at the University of Maine, and an expert on Japan-China ties. “In that sense, they’re actually on the same side... and if Japan leans away from the US because of decreased economic opportunities, there’s a potential for closer ties with China,” she told AFP. Complementary economies The two leaders are likely to focus on a range of potential deals, including joint investments in infrastructure in regional nations including Indonesia and the Philippines. Abe has signalled some interest in China’s massive “Belt and Road Initiative”, which funds major infrastructure work, but experts said a concrete deal on Japanese participation was unlikely for now. Both sides are keen to improve economic cooperation, with Japanese business eager for increased access to China’s massive market, and Beijing interested in Japanese technology and corporate knowhow. “Japan and China have really nicely complementary economies, and they can benefit hugely from having closer trade and investment ties,” said Vekasi. “They’ll try and bring home some economic tangibles. That’s generally where they’ve been able to successfully cooperate in the past.” The two leaders may find less common ground outside of the economic realm, with tensions lingering over territorial issues. Just days before Abe’s trip, Tokyo lodged an official complaint after Chinese ships cruised around the disputed islands that Tokyo calls the Senkaku and Beijing labels the Diaoyu islands. And in September, Japan carried out its first submarine drills in the disputed South China Sea. Japan does not border the South China Sea but has expressed concern about Chinese military activity there. Panda diplomacy?  Abe and Xi are likely to simply avoid those thornier issues, said Kazuyuki Suwa, a professor of political science at the University of Shizuoka. “Neither side will make any compromises... They will say what they need to say, and won’t likely agree to go beyond that,” he told AFP. “The relationship is a mixture of cooperation and confrontation, and that will stay the same.” Much of the meeting will be about optics, with both men looking for the symbolic boost that the summit will provide. Abe will also be hoping to extract a pledge that China will make good on plans for Xi to pay a reciprocal visit to Japan next year. If he succeeds, “that itself should be called one of the major achievements of this trip,” Suwa said. And there may be other diplomatic tools at the ready as well. When Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited Japan earlier this year, he announced a gift of a pair of rare wild crested ibises, which arrived this month. Japanese media have reported Abe is hoping that his visit will produce a bigger bonanza in the form of some panda diplomacy, with zoos in Sendai and Kobe apparently angling for new additions."

An eight-second surveillance video released by Chongqing city police on its Weibo social media account shows the two arguing and grappling with each other in the moments before the bus suddenly veered across oncoming traffic and off the bridge Sunday morning. Buses in China often have surveillance cameras. A statement from Wanzhou district police said the 48-year-old female passenger asked the driver to pull over after she missed her stop, but he didn't. She walked up to the driver's seat and scolded him. The driver turned his head back several times arguing. As the quarrel escalated, the statement said, the woman hit the driver on the head with her cellphone. The driver took his right arm off the steering wheel and fought back. He grabbed her arm when she attacked him again, then hastily steered to the left, sending the bus out of control. The Chongqing police also posted dashcam video from a nearby car showing the bus colliding with an oncoming vehicle before smashing through a guardrail and falling into the Yangtze, a major river in southwestern China. The Wanzhou police statement said the behavior of the driver and the passenger seriously endangered public safety and violated the law. Rescuers lifted the wreck of the bus from the river Wednesday night. Thirteen bodies have been found and two remain missing, the official Xinhua News Agency said."

Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, center, the president-elect of the Maldives interacts with his supporters during a gathering in Male, Maldives, Monday, Sept. 24, 2018. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih was inaugurated on Saturday as the new president of the Maldives after the opposition united to dislodge pro-China strongman leader Abdulla Yameen in September elections. At a special session of parliament held at the National Football Stadium in the capital Male, Solih was sworn in with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi among those in attendance. The Maldives foreign ministry said China's culture minister Luo Shugang was also an invitee. Modi's presence was a reflection of the relief felt in India, which has long held sway in the archipelago, and in the West that Yameen was voted out. The United States and the European Union had threatened sanctions if the vote had not been free and fair. Both neighbouring India and Western nations watched with concern as Yameen moved closer to Beijing which loaned the strategically placed archipelago millions of dollars for infrastructure. ""I am confident that my visit will herald a new era of even closer exchanges and cooperation between our two countries,"" Modi said on Facebook, especially in ""infrastructure, health care, connectivity and human resource development."" Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) has pledged to end what it called ""China's colonialism"" and to resist a ""land grab"" in the country which straddles key East-West shipping routes. MDP leader and former president Mohamed Nasheed has vowed his party would reduce reliance on China and renegotiate millions of dollars in loans taken from Beijing. More than 80 percent the Maldives foreign debt is owed to China, he said. Beijing loans China has also loaned other countries around the Indian Ocean and beyond large amounts of money for infrastructure projects as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, alarming the West. Sri Lanka last year granted a 99-year lease on the Hambantota deep-sea port to Beijing, after it was unable to repay Chinese loans for the $1.4-billion project. Mahinda Rajapakse, Sri Lanka's prime minister when Colombo took out the loans, is looking to return to power in the severe current political crisis gripping the island nation. During a recent visit to Colombo in the middle of his election campaign, Solih told reporters that he wanted to repair ties with immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and India. Yameen awarded major infrastructure projects to China while taking away a major airport development from India. He also relied on Beijing for diplomatic support as the Maldives faced international isolation over his dismal rights record. Modi had cancelled his first visit to the country in 2015 after Yameen detained pro-India Nasheed and eventually had him convicted on a terrorism charge and jailed for 13 years."

An acrimonious meeting of world leaders in Papua New Guinea failed to agree Sunday on a final communique, highlighting widening divisions between global powers the US and China. The 21 nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Port Moresby struggled to bridge differences on the role of the World Trade Organization, which governs international trade. A statement would be issued by the meeting's chair, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, instead. ""The entire world is worried"" about tensions between China and the US, O'Neill told a mob of reporters that descended on him after he confirmed there was no communique from leaders. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters there were differences between several nations including China and the US Draft versions of the communique showed the US wanted strong language against unfair trade practices that it accuses China of. The two-day summit was punctuated by acrimony and underlined a rising rivalry between China and the West for influence in the usually neglected South Pacific. US-China war of words US Vice President Mike Pence and China's President Xi Jinping traded barbs in speeches on Saturday.  Pence professed respect for Xi and China but also harshly criticised the world's number 2 economy for intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and unfair trading practices. The world, according to Xi, is facing a choice between cooperation and confrontation as protectionism and unilateralism grows. He said the rules of global institutions set up after World War II such as the World Trade Organization should not be bent for selfish agendas. Pence told reporters that during the weekend he had two ""candid"" conversations with Xi, who is expected to meet President Donald Trump at a Group of 20 summit at the end of this month in Buenos Aires. ""There are differences today. They begin with trade practices, with tariffs and quotas, forced technology transfers, the theft of intellectual property. It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights,"" Pence said. The US is interested in a better relationship ""but there has to be change"" from China's side, Pence said he told Xi, who responded that dialogue is important. China's aid and loans In Port Moresby, the impact of China's aid and loans is highly visible. But the US and allies are countering with efforts to finance infrastructure in Papua New Guinea and other island states. The US has also said it will be involved in ally Australia's plan to develop a naval base with Papua New Guinea. On Sunday, the US, New Zealand, Japan and Australia said they would work with Papua New Guinea's government to bring electricity to 70 percent of its people by 2030. Less than 20 percent have a reliable electricity supply. ""The commitment of the United States of America to this region of the world has never been stronger,"" said Pence at a signing ceremony. A separate statement from his office said other countries are welcome to join the electrification initiative provided they support the US vision of a free and open Pacific. China, meanwhile, has promised $4 billion of finance to build the the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, among the least urbanised countries in the world."

Leaders at the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) failed to agree on a communique for the first time in its history last weekend. The inability of the APEC leaders to reach a consensus reflects deep divisions between the United States and China. “You know the two big giants in the room,” Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said at a closing news conference, when asked which of the 21 members of the APEC group could not agree. During the summit, the US and China had a dispute over which is the better investment partner when it comes to trade and security in the region. Chinese President Xi Jinping dwelled on the economic structure of the world by suggesting free trade.  His stance against protectionism was seen as a veiled comment targeting the Trump policies that have led to the recent trade wars. Xi said: ""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners."" The Chinese leader did not mention his country’s militarisation in the South China Sea or its repressive policies against Muslim Uyghurs. American Vice President Mike Pence stated that the US won’t change its stance against Chinese economic policy. According to the US, the “fair trade”, suggested by China, is a tool with which to exploit the small Pacific countries and make them economically dependent on China. Xi made a push to expand China’s influence in the Pacific on Friday, holding a forum with the leaders of eight small island countries at the Papua New Guinea (PNG) conference. The Chinese president arrived to great fanfare on Thursday and was feted by PNG officials. He stoked Western concern on Friday when he met Pacific island leaders to pitch his Belt and Road initiative.  The United States and its allies, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, countered on Sunday with a $1.7 billion plan to deliver reliable electricity and the internet to PNG. Pence also announced that the US and Australia would build a naval base on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island.  “We will work with these nations to protect the sovereignty and maritime rights of Pacific islands as well,” Pence said. Adding to the electricity plan for PNG, the US involvement in the building of a naval base in Manus Island shows that the confrontation between China and the US is extending from economy to security in the Pacific region. History of the US-China trade war  China has been on Trump's radar since before his inauguration. From the theft of American technological know-how to interventionist policies, Trump has not held back in his criticism of his country’s top trade partner or in doling out punishment. The US slapped a 25% tariff on $34 billion of Chinese goods in early July. Another round of duties on $16 billion-worth of goods went into effect on August 23, bringing the total amount facing a 25% charge to $50 billion. The administration has accused China of pressuring ""foreign companies to transfer technology"" if they want investment, of pursuing ""policies aimed at limiting market access for foreign manufacturers"", and not negotiating trade practices which will help reduce the trade deficit that Trump has made his mission to pare down. The US buys more from China than it sells to the country, a trade deficit of $375 billion, and in order to reduce that deficit — a promise Trump made during his campaign trail — the US levied tariffs hoping consumers would turn to local products and to protect American jobs from what Trump calls “unfair trade practices”, according to a statement released by the White House.   China has fought back with matching tariffs of the same amount on US exports to China. In a tit-for-tat tariff war, the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced a 25% surcharge on $16 billion worth of US goods after the US green-lighted the August 23 tariffs.  The duties imposed by the two countries will push up the prices of 1,300 goods altogether. The 333 goods being targeted by China include vehicles, diesel, gasoline, propane, asphalt, fiber-optic cables, agricultural products and seafood."

(November 24, 2018) An explosion and fire near a chemical factory left at least 22 people dead and 22 others injured in northern China on Wednesday, authorities said. The incident near Hebei Shenghua Chemical Co. in Zhangjiakou, a city some 200 kilometres (124 miles) northwest of Beijing, also burned 50 large and small trucks, local media said on its Weibo social media account. The injured were taken to hospital for treatment following the blast, which occurred at 00:41 am, according to the statement. The charred and smoking remains of trucks and cars were scattered on a road as firefighters worked at the scene, according to photos posted on Twitter by broadcaster CGTN. ""On-site search and rescue work and investigation of the cause of the accident are still under way,"" CGTN said. Zhangjiakou will host the Olympic alpine skiing events at the 2022 Winter Games, which Beijing is organising. It was not immediately clear if the explosion was near the site. Industrial, road accidents Road and industrial accidents are common in China. A blast at a chemical plant in southwest Sichuan province left 19 dead and 12 injured in July. The company had undertaken illegal construction that had not passed safety checks, according to local authorities. In 2015, giant chemical blasts in a container storage facility killed at least 165 people in the northern port city of Tianjin. The explosions caused more than $1 billion in damage and sparked widespread anger at a perceived lack of transparency over the accident's causes and its environmental impact. China has also experienced its share of horrific road crashes, with traffic regulations often flouted or unenforced. Two cars ploughed into crowds in two separate incidents in recent days: Five children were killed when a driver deliberately rammed into students crossing a road in northeast China last week and seven people died when another car hit people on a sidewalk in the southwest on Tuesday. An out-of-control truck ploughed into a 31-car lineup in northwest Gansu province earlier this month, killing 15 people and injuring 44. In November last year, a highway pileup involving at least 30 cars killed 18 people in eastern Anhui province."

So what role can Nepal play as it is stuck between a rock and a hard place? Nepalese army soldiers participate in a parade to mark Constitution Day in Kathmandu, Nepal, Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2018. (AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha) Can landlocked nations protect their sovereignty from military powers? For a realist, the answer is obvious, and this is where Nepal’s future hangs in the balance. Lodged between two emerging powers, China and India, Nepal is no match. After Nepal opted to not partake in the BIMSTEC’s (The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) joint military exercise this September, India expressed its dissatisfaction and termed the move as an embarrassment and inappropriate. Analysts believe Nepal’s move comes after its tilt towards China since Nepal’s participation in the BIMSTEC was limited to an observer, and then later decided to hold a joint military drill in China immediately after the pull-out. Also, Nepal also doesn’t want to isolate Pakistan at a time when India is making every move to do so. China, on the other hand, is hell-bent to seize the diminishing scope of India’s influence. Both India and China are trying to seduce Nepal’s Army through funding. However, China is a step ahead as it has announced it would provide over $21 million to the Nepalese Army for humanitarian and disaster relief equipment. A declassified CIA document, obtained by Wikileaks, revealed that the CIA feared an occupation of Nepal by its immediate neighbours during the 1962 Sino-India war. The document speculates that India was premeditating an occupation of the southern parts of Nepal before 1962: “Nevertheless, we believe that India will pursue a cautious course, lest it jeopardizes its other activities in Nepal. These include the manning of border posts along the Nepalese-Tibetan border and the right to recruit Gurkha troops. There are 29 battalions of Gurkhas totaling about 27, 000 men in the Indian Army. Such rights are dependent upon the King’s pleasure. More important, however, is India’s fear that Mahendra, if pushed too hard, might carry out his threat to seek Communist military support, which would force India to intervene militarily in Nepal. While India could secure the southern lowlands and probably the Kathmandu Valley and other points in Central Nepal, the Chinese—who control two key passes of north Kathmandu—could take over much of northern Nepal and thus greatly increase Indian difficulty in securing its Himalayan frontier.” India was not only miffed with Nepal during the 1962 Sino-China war for not siding with it, but the southern neighbour also imposed an economic blockade on Nepal during 1989 when Nepal decided to buy arms from China. The document also reveals that India has always considered Nepal as a part of its security regime and had intentions to annex Nepal since the East India Company left their country. This argument was given weight when Modi-led India imposed the second blockade on Nepal in 2015 – in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. Why did India react so harshly? Nepal had gone ahead to pass its new constitution and India didn’t really like with it. After the constitution was passed, India also criticised Nepal’s human rights situation at the United Nations (UN) with no self-awareness about the hypocrisy contained within its criticism. Analysts often argue that India is always prying on Nepal’s water resources and that it doesn’t want the Himalayan kingdom to develop because it would mean that India’s demands would no longer be heard or would remain relevant. There’s a famous saying that one can change its friends but not its neighbours, and Nepalis know that all too well. The fact is that China and India will not attack Nepal militarily at this period. There are two main reasons. First, both countries are struggling with their internal problems like Kashmir, Naxalites (Maoist rebels), refugee issues, the rise of secessionist groups, terrorism, climate change, economy, Tibet, Xinjiang. Second, both nations know that occupying Nepal will only invite more trouble. The presence of Nepal’s Gurkha regiment in the Indian army also makes it complicated in the south of the country. Nepal is already trying to reduce its dependency on China by signing a trade pact with China—which now allows Nepal to access several ports. There’s also talk of connecting Tibet and Kathmandu via railways. Military power is often seen as an aggressive tool in the modern world. However, China and India will continue their tussle to seal military dominance in Nepal whether western powers like it or not. On the other hand, it’s only the Nepali leaders who can secure Nepal’s sovereignty in the coming days. With the diminishing role of the United States in global politics and the chances of China becoming the next superpower, Nepal can only wait and watch how the future unfolds for its neighbours and itself too. In the meantime, it should work on becoming the Brussels of South Asia, engage militarily on an international level, lessen its dependency on both China and India, and improve its economy in a meaningful manner."

But it does little law making, serving as a platform to highlight the government's plans for the year and earn endorsement. Delegates attend the opening session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, March 5, 2019. China announced a robust annual economic growth target and a 7.5 percent rise in military spending on Tuesday as it convened an annual legislative session overshadowed by a tariff war with Washington. Seeking to defuse US and European complaints the Chinese system is rigged against foreign companies, Premier Li Keqiang promised in a speech to the National People's Congress (NPC) they will be ""treated as equals"" with their Chinese competitors. Li, the country's top economic official, set this year's growth target at 6 to 6.5 percent, reflecting determination to shore up a cooling, state-dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses. Slightly below last year's 6.6 percent growth, a three-decade low, it would be among the world's strongest if achieved. The premier promised to ""promote China-US trade negotiations,"" but gave no details of talks aimed at ending the fight with US President Donald Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions and complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Li, No. 2 in the governing Communist Party behind President Xi Jinping, pledged higher spending on development of technologies including artificial intelligence, electric cars, biotechnology and new materials that China's leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence. He also promised more money for education, social programs and public works construction. Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing.  China's growing tech prowess worries competitors China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, telecom equipment, solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices. But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment. Li warned the second-largest economy faces a ""graver and more complicated environment"" and risks that ""are greater in number and size."" The two-week gathering of the congress's 3,000-plus delegates in the cavernous Great Hall of the People is China's biggest event of the year. It does little law making, but serves as a platform to highlight the government's plans for the year. President Xi Jinping's government is expected to use this year's session to announce tax cuts and more support for entrepreneurs who generate much of China's new jobs and wealth. Legislators also are due to endorse a law that aims to ease tensions with Washington and Europe by discouraging officials from pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. Higher government spending will push the budget deficit from 2.6 percent of total economic output to 2.8 percent, Li said. The plans reflect ""emphatic pro-growth efforts"" to ""offset external headwinds,"" Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in a report. Proposed tax cuts of up to 2 trillion yuan ($300 billion) would put ""significant spending power"" in the hands of consumers and companies, helping to buoy sagging demand for autos, household appliances and other goods, Varathan said. Military spending to increase Spending on the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, will rise to 1.2 trillion yuan ($178 billion), according to a separate report issued by the finance ministry. China's total military outlay, the second-largest behind the United States, is estimated by independent experts to exceed $220 billion a year when off-budget expenses are added in. The spending will pay to expand China's navy and acquire advanced aircraft and other weapons to help Beijing enforce its territorial claims in the South China Sea. The slower rise in military spending, down from double digit increases in previous years, reflects changing priorities, said Yue Gang, a military expert and retired Chinese army colonel. ""It is more urgent for China to prepare for a trade war with the US, instead of a physical war,"" Yue said. Military reforms are nearly complete, and ""China needs the money to be used for more urgent matters,"" he said. Tariff war continues The tariff fight with Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions has rattled Chinese consumers and investors, prompting some to put off spending, which could add to downward pressure on economic growth. News reports say Washington and Beijing might be close to an agreement to end the battle. But the chief US envoy, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, said earlier the two sides still had much work to do. No agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute: US pressure on Beijing to roll back its plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology. Washington, Europe and other trading partners say those violate China's market-opening obligations. Some US officials worry they might erode US industrial leadership. It's unclear if Trump would be mollified by the technology measure, part of a law on foreign investment that state media say the congress is due to endorse. It would bar officials from using ""administrative measures"" to pressure companies to hand over technology. Foreign business groups welcomed the proposal but said they need to see enforcement rules to know whether it will improve conditions. Li tried to reassure investors by promising foreign companies will be ""treated as equals"" with Chinese enterprises in a ""fair and impartial market environment."" Foreign business groups and governments complain Beijing routinely violates its commitments under the World Trade Organization to ensure such equality, or ""national treatment."" They say rules on investment, technology licensing and other facets of business discriminate against foreign companies or shield Chinese enterprises from competition. Xi and other Chinese leaders have announced changes over the past year including tariff cuts on imported consumer goods and plans to allow full foreign ownership in auto manufacturing. But business groups say those have little impact on operating conditions. Beijing faces a WTO challenge filed in July by the European Union against technology licensing rules the 28-nation trade bloc said improperly hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Li promised ""competitive neutrality,"" or equal treatment of state-owned and private companies by regulators. But he gave no details of how far that might extend for foreign competitors. ""Enterprises under all forms of ownership will be treated on an equal footing,"" the premier said."

Yet the odds seem stacked against any substantive resolution this week to the standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Perhaps the best that might be hoped for, analysts say, is for the two sides to agree to keep talking. The differences between Beijing and Washington are vast. The United States is essentially demanding that China downsize its economic aspiration to become a supreme world leader in such fields as robotics and electric cars.

Patrick Fok reports from Beijing. Earlier negotiations flamed out. And this time President Trump might be inclined to drive an especially hard bargain after being forced to cave in a dispute with congressional Democrats that partially shut the federal government for 35 days. Charges against Huawei Moreover, a new complication injected itself into US-China relations on the eve of the talks when the Justice Department brought criminal charges Monday against the Chinese tech giant Huawei, accusing it of stealing technology secrets and violating sanctions against Iran. Beijing shot back by demanding that the Trump administration pull back from what it called an ""unreasonable crackdown"" on the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecom gear. ""We are anticipating no big outcomes this week,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president at the US-China Business Council. On March 2, the Trump administration is scheduled to escalate its tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. The American delegation to this week's talks is led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a longtime critic of aggressive Chinese trade practices and of US policies that failed to blunt them. Heading the Chinese team is Vice Premier Liu He. The core of the US allegations against China is that Beijing systematically steals trade secrets, forces foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of access to the Chinese market and subsidises its own tech companies. But compelling China to reform its trade policies and treatment of foreign companies will be difficult. The administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports; Beijing has retaliated with import taxes on $110 billion in US goods. Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods. If he did, Trump's import taxes would cover virtually everything China ships to the United States. US officials insist that the Huawei case is entirely separate from the trade negotiations. "

The “Doomsday Clock”, unveiled every year by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, remains at a dangerous two minutes to midnight.   The clock measures how close are we to the apocalyptic midnight — the hour when the human civilisation is predicted to end in a man-made catastrophe. The last time scientists judged the world was this close to disaster was in 1953, during the early volatility of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff that ensued. This time, it’s the impending collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Agreement, and Moscow and Washington’s emphasis on modernising their nuclear forces, instead of dismantling them.  What’s it all about? The Trump administration delivered an ultimatum to Russia, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning that the United States will no longer “bury our head in the sand”, following an accusation that Russia had allegedly violated the INF.  The Cold War-era treaty dates back to 1987, a turning point in the arms race between the United States and Russia when both sides agreeing to stop producing missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres.   The Cold War powers agreed that mid-range nuclear weapons made it easier to accidentally trigger nuclear conflict. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference between normal or nuclear warhead-equipped missiles, with the possibility of triggering a nuclear race or war with every missile deployment, launch or test. Pompeo stated that Russia had only 60 days to comply with the terms of the treaty, or the United States would withdraw from the historic agreement, prompting concerns over a renewed arms race between the world powers.  The clock runs out on February 2, and no solution is in sight.  You’re the reason I’m leaving The warning followed a report by Daniel Coats, US Director of National Intelligence, revealing that Russia had developed the 9M729 ‘Novator’ missile in 2015, a violation of the treaty. Russia hid the testing of the ground missile and its capabilities from treaty inspections, before eventually deploying “multiple battalions” of the banned weapon.  The missile is a “direct conventional and nuclear threat against most of Europe and parts of Asia,” said Coats. But the United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, with little evidence to support its claim.  Losing the blame game  US and Russian officials met in Geneva on January 15 to discuss compliance issues with the INF, while Russia exhibited the 9M729 missile to military attaches in Moscow to ease concerns, claiming that they did not violate the maximum range of the treaty (480 km). Their efforts had no effect.  The fact that the US beat Russia to a withdrawal however, handed the Kremlin a major public relations victory.  Meanwhile, Russia denied all charges, and countered with three of their own. Two of the charges don’t hold up to scrutiny, but the third may be grounded in fact.  Russia accused the US of stationing its Mk-41 launcher in its Aegis Ashore Facility in Romania, which has been confirmed by many reports. Less well known is that the launcher can fire missiles of any kind, including mid-range nuclear warheads.   Who killed the treaty? Following the failed talks, and days ahead of the US withdrawal from the critical treaty, the US has begun the production of low-yield nuclear warheads, which could also lower the threshold for nuclear conflict.  Ahead of the US planned withdrawal, this has sparked concerns of an impending arms race.  But the treaty should have prevented the Russia from building the ‘Novator’, which can strike NATO allies with little warning in minutes. The treaty’s main criticism was that it only limited the US and Russia, with no restrictions on China, Iran, North Korea or other rising world powers.  The Red Dragon China has expressed no interest in joining the INF treaty.   With growing turbulence in the South China sea, the US is hard pressed to contain China as it catches up on the technological advantage that the United States once exclusively enjoyed. The military balance is shifting, and not in the United State’s favor. China recently deployed a ‘Carrier Killer’ intermediate nuclear-capable missile, the Dong Feng-26, which translates to ‘East Wind’. Difficult to shoot down, the ballistic missile is able to adjust position mid-flight, and has the potential to cripple or destroy an aircraft carrier with a range of 4,500 km. As part of a multi-layered defence strategy, the DF-26 allows China to neutralise or destroy prized US aircraft carrier from a distance. The United States’ most recent aircraft carrier cost $13 billion, while a volley of DF-26 missiles would cost less than $20 million, putting the US at a severe strategic disadvantage.  The aircraft carrier holds a prized role in any navy, serving as a launch base for air strikes and beach invasions. US aircraft carriers form the backbone of its navy, and are key to its force projection.  The impending withdrawal from the INF treaty may be motivated by a policy of Chinese containment.  Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Pacific Command, stated, “We have no ground-based [missile] capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence to the [INF] treaty.” In his testimony to Congress, he cited Chinese cutting-edge developments on weapons systems that “far outrange US systems”.  “They have done this at a fraction of the cost of some of our more expensive systems. Constrained in part by our adherence to the INF treaty, the US has fallen behind in our ability to match the long-range fires capabilities of the new era,” he added. Top-level White House officials have not shied away from revealing the true drive behind the treaty withdrawal. US National Security Advisor John Bolton commented on the restrictions of the INF treaty being in the interest of China, “If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?”  More recently, Bolton tried to convince Moscow that Chinese missiles are a threat to “the heart of Russia”. “We see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it. So the possibility that could have existed 15 years ago to enlarge the treaty and make it universal today just simply was not practical,” he added. The US approach to the INF treaty has been one of ultimatums thus far, and shows no signs of goodwill.  In his initial announcement of the pending withdrawal, Pompeo stated: “The burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes, only they can save this treaty.” Fallout and a renewed arms race Russia however, is not likely to respond to US ultimatums, or back down from US charges given that it would mean admitting to a violation in the first place, without a US overture of the same. The consequences of the INF’s collapse are far-reaching, and will have deep effects on global security and nuclear disarmament. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the US and Russia to resume talks and extend the The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), in response to the ratcheting tensions between the two states. START took place between the US and Soviet Union in 1991, and was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Resuming talks with the shadow of non-compliance to the INF treaty however, is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes. US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against it, finding it “difficult to envision progress in extending (New START)” given the breakdown of the INF.  Trump’s staunch position draw largely on Bolton, who has come under question regarding his capacity to act as a national security adviser. Bolton was formerly a lawyer, with no experience as a strategist, and has consistently expressed his dislike of international organisations.  In his first speech as a national security adviser, he called for the end of the International Criminal Court, and has previously criticised the United Nations as well.  Who loses, who wins? Bolton’s push for end of the INF treaty may prove profitable to US arms industries however, a fact not lost on Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to address this. ""American people should also think about the rationality of their government’s plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty, which will trigger a new arms race. If it serves someone’s interest, it is the US military-industrial complex since it promises new large orders. But the life of Americans will inevitably become less secure,"" he said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg commented on the detriments of the treaty’s collapse, stating: “NATO is unlikely to deploy more nuclear weapons to Europe should an arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow collapse.” With a worsening security climate and more belligerent China, it remains to be seen whether the INF treaty can be salvaged for changed times. The price of failed dialogue this time is drastic however, giving rise to a new arms race, a lowered threshold for nuclear conflict and a new cold war."

It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"". The move will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from US President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years. Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement. A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life. Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. "

This photograph taken and released by the Intermediate Peoples' Court of Dalian on January 14, 2019 shows Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (C) during his retrial on drug trafficking charges in the court in Dalian in China's northeast Liaoning province. A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily. The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians. The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's northeast province of Liaoning re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement. Trudeau strongly condemned Monday's proceeding, suggesting that China was using its judicial system to pressure Canada over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. In his strongest comments yet, Trudeau said, ""All countries around the world"" should be concerned that Beijing is acting arbitrarily with its justice system. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply a death penalty,"" Trudeau said. Canada later updated its travel advisory for China urging Canadians to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws."" 10 days to appeal Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement. Schellenberg's lawyer said on Monday he would appeal. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation. We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" TRT World speaks to Chris Alexander, a former Canadian diplomat in Russia.   'Politicising law'  China is not putting pressure on Canada by sentencing a Canadian to death for drug smuggling, and any suggestion it was doing so showed ""rude contempt"" of China's law, its state media said. ""Public opinion in Canada has claimed recently that China is 'politicizing' Schellenberg's case, but what Canada is doing is actually politicizing law,"" the Global Times said. China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security. Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by US authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal. Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week that the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defence,"" but did not give details. Earlier on Monday, China's government dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock."" Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice. Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted. ""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place."" 222 kilogrammes of methamphetamine St-Jacques said Canada should immediately call for a top-level meeting of foreign policy and security advisers from the two nations ""to impress upon the Chinese side that they have to abide by international law"". Alex Lawrence, chief spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment. William Nee of Amnesty International noted that drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law. Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009. The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in late 2014. Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued in court that he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence. The Liaoning High Court in late December ordered the case retried after prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper. Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organisations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000."

The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest. (Oct. 21, 2018) Twenty-one coal miners were killed after a roof collapsed at a coal mine in northern China, local media reported. A total of 87 people were working underground in the Shaanxi province mine at the time of the accident on Saturday afternoon, official news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The cause of the accident at the site, run by Baiji Mining, is still under investigation. Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record despite efforts to improve coal production conditions and crack down on illegal mines. In December last year, seven miners were killed and three others injured in an accident at a coal mine in China's southwest. In October, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping workers. Only one miner was rescued alive. According to China's National Coal Mine Safety Administration, the country saw 375 coal mining related deaths in 2017, down 28.7 percent year-on-year. But despite improvements, ""the situation of coal mine safety production is still grim,"" the bureau said in a statement following a coal mine safety conference last January."

(L-R) Former premier William Lai, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and new premier Su Tseng-chang join hands after a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan on January 11, 2019. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen appointed a close political ally as premier during a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday following the ruling party's heavy election losses in November and growing pressure from rival China. Su Tseng-chang took charge of the Cabinet amid tense relations with Beijing, which threatens to use force to take control of the island it claims as its own. China responded to Tsai's 2016 victory by cutting all contacts with her government and has ratcheted up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-governing democracy. The opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with Beijing, won 15 of 22 major seats in the November 24 local elections, including in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's southern stronghold of Kaohsiung. Soon after, Tsai resigned as chair of the DPP, which rejects China's demands for unification with the mainland. Analysts attributed the DPP's election losses to disappointment with the performance of Tsai's government, which had won a broad mandate, including seizing a majority in the legislature from the Nationalists for the first time since full democracy was attained three decades ago. 'Safeguarding sovereignty' ""The people expect us to improve livelihoods. The people expect us to protect democracy. The people expect us to safeguard sovereignty,"" Tsai said at a ceremony at the Presidential Office Building a day after incumbent William Lai said he was resigning along with the entire Cabinet in response to local election defeats.  ""These challenges need an experienced premier such as Su Tseng-chang to overcome."" Su thanked Tsai for her trust and support, adding, ""Now, I will lead the team and roll up my sleeves to satisfy the people's expectations and respond to people's interests."" China's pressure campaign has increased Taiwan's international isolation, reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17, excluding its representatives to international gatherings, and forcing international companies to designate Taiwan as a part of China.  Chinese President Xi Jinping renewed the threat of invasion in a January 2 address, saying the ruling communists ""made no promises to abandon the use of force."" The island's high-tech economy continues to grow at a sluggish pace, and salaries for graduates have remained flat, increasing the lure of opportunities in China. Efforts at pension and fiscal reform have also been unpopular. Su, 71, was a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the DPP during the former martial law era under the Nationalists, who shifted their government from China to Taiwan after defeat by the communists on the mainland in 1949. He previously served as premier in 2006-07, as well as party chairman, legislator and county magistrate."

Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-un firm backing in deadlocked nuclear talks with the United States, insisting the two sides should meet ""halfway"", Chinese state media said on Thursday. Kim visited Beijing this week for two days of talks that reasserted China's role in the process, and were seen as a strategy session ahead of an expected second summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump. At their first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim and Trump signed a vaguely worded document with Kim pledging to work towards the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" But progress has since stalled with Pyongyang and Washington – which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea – disagreeing over what that means. The DPRK wants relief from the multiple sets of sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, while the US wants the measures to remain in place until it gives up its arms – something Pyongyang has made no public promise to do. China also wants the sanctions relaxed and Xi said he ""hopes that the DPRK and the United States will meet each other halfway"" according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Xi ""spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the DPRK side,"" Xinhua added. North Korea has carried out six nuclear blasts and launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the whole of the United States, but has carried out no such tests for more than a year, and blew up the entrances to a nuclear testing ground it said it no longer needed. Pyongyang has rejected demands for what it calls its ""unilateral"" disarmament as ""gangster-like."" Trump's rhetoric following the Singapore meeting has assumed a commitment from Pyongyang, without mentioning the US nuclear umbrella in the northeast Asian region, which the DPRK wants removed. China is the North's sole major ally and key trade partner but relations had deteriorated over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, before warming up last year, with Kim meeting Xi three times. Kim ""raised concern"" about the impasse in talks with the US, according to Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, which said the Chinese leader had issued a ringing endorsement of the North's position. ""Xi Jinping said that the legitimate issues raised by the DPRK are rightful demands and that he fully agrees that the DPRK's reasonable interests should be justly resolved,"" it said.  Summit 'imminent'  Each of the previous Kim-Xi meetings have come shortly before or after the North Korean's summits with either Trump or South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump said Sunday the US and North Korea were negotiating the location of their next summit, a meeting Moon said Thursday was ""imminent."" Pyongyang needed to take ""bold, practical measures for denuclearisation"" to ensure sanctions are lifted, Moon told reporters, but acknowledging Pyongyang's concerns at the lack of reciprocity added that ""corresponding measures"" were also needed from the US, such as agreeing a ""peace regime"" and formally declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon acknowledged the Singapore agreement was ""somewhat vague,"" and there was ""scepticism"" over Kim's denuclearisation pledge. But Kim had assured him and other leaders that his view of denuclearisation was ""no different in any way from what the international community demands,"" Moon said, and Pyongyang would not link it to the presence of US forces in the South or nearby. Nonetheless a commentary carried by KCNA last month stressed that when Pyongyang refers to ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", it includes the North, the South, and ""surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted."" Birthday banquet for Kim Washington and Beijing have competing strategic interests in northeast Asia, and Xinhua said Xi had re-asserted China's importance in the diplomatic process. Beijing stands ready to ""play a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace and stability and realising denuclearisation on the peninsula and lasting peace and stability in the region,"" it cited the Chinese president as saying. Xi greeted Kim at Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People on Tuesday – believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday – before hosting a welcome banquet for Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim visited a pharmaceutical plant that makes traditional Chinese medicine on Wednesday and met Xi again for lunch before heading home. The visit coincided with trade talks between Chinese and US officials. Analysts say China could use the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, but Beijing's foreign ministry rejected any link between Kim's trip and the talks. There was a ""rare historic opportunity"" for a political settlement on the peninsula, Xi said according to Xinhua, and China ""supports the DPRK and the United States holding summits and achieving results."""

Three days of US-Chinese talks aimed at ending a costly tariff battle wrapped up Wednesday in an optimistic atmosphere after President Donald Trump said they were ""going very well!"" No details were immediately announced, but Asian stock markets rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later. ""Going very well!"" The talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meeting since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further punitive action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over the fight sparked by American complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. ""Talks with China are going very well!"" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter. Washington is pressing Beijing for changes including rolling back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics and other fields. Europe, Japan and other trading partners echo US complaints those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. Chinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence. No time for change? Neither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies. ""Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,"" said Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan in a report. Beijing has tried to defuse pressure for more sweeping change by offering concessions including purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. That might offer relief to rural areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election and were targeted by Chinese tariffs. However, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies. Those include initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led creation of Chinese global champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations. American leaders also worry they might erode US industrial leadership. US companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement. The difficulties The US demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up. ""These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to US companies,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the US-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. Beijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese licensing rules it said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Companies that have been disappointed by Beijing's failure or delays in carrying out commitments want an enforcement mechanism with ""some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,"" said Parker. ""That's not something that's going to be done by March,"" said Parker. ""It's probably going to take a little longer."" For its part, Beijing is unhappy with US export and investment curbs, suggesting it might demand concessions. Chinese officials complain about controls on ""dual use"" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged. This week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran. The American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. China responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses. Chinese exports to the United States held up despite the tariff hikes, but that was due partly to exporters rushing to fill orders before any more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year. Cooling economic growth in both countries is increasing pressure to reach a settlement. Car and property sales have slumped as Chinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter but surveys show consumer confidence weakening."

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday on an unannounced visit for talks with President Xi Jinping, as preparations ramp up for an expected second summit with Donald Trump. South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. A motorcade was seen leaving a Beijing train station, with police blocking a street with metal gates hours after Kim's train crossed the border into northern China, according to AFP journalists. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed. TRT World spoke to journalist Patrick Fok in Hong Kong for more. Last year, Kim travelled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the US and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that US State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The US State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. ""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. ""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."" At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea's foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks."""

China has approved a law to ‘improve’ its policy of creating a Chinese form of Islam, whichis set to impact thesignificant Muslim population in the communist country. According to the Global Times, the English-language state-owned daily, state-sanctioned representatives from local religious associations ineight Chinese provinces discussed a five-year plan on the ‘sinicisation of Islam’ - the attempt to construct a form of Islam more in line with official state ideology. The effort comes as an ambitious bid to ‘redefine’ the practices of Islam and ‘align’ the beliefs of Muslims with the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) policies and traditional Chinese culture. Islam entered China through trading routes and merchants, with first contact established in the 7th Century,and hasbeen part of Chinese society for more than 1,000 years.   The head of the China Islamic Association, a state-sanctioned body, appealed to the different local organisations toimplementthe measures,combiningsocialist core values, laws and traditional culture in lectures to Muslims,by providing them with the necessary indoctrination.  Journalists David Gitter and Julia Bowie criticised the ‘sinicisation policies in an article for the Tokyo-based The Diplomat, stating: “The various comments by these officials [of the CPC) ... will play a key role in ramping up pressure on religious groups. The sinicisation campaign will be directed at members of all religions, and will focus on … theological changes.”  ‘Sinicization’ of religions communities  The vice dean of the China Islamic Institute said that ‘sinicization of Islam’ and Muslims in China has ‘matured’ since China’s president Xi Jinping came up with the state policy in 2015. ‘Books and any kind of material will be used as sources in mosques in this year -  to have a better understanding of ‘Islam sinicization’’, said the vice dean. ‘Sinicization’ of religious beliefs reached a new level for the Chinese government. In September 2017, five religious community leaders agreed ‘to the direction of religions to integrate them with Chinese culture’.  Michael Clarke from the Australian National University in Canberra told the Foreign Policy Journal  that “the ultimate aim seems to be the Sinicization of these [East Turkestan and Hui] regions and ethnicities. ..since 1949, China has wanted to integrate … ethnic groups of Xinjiang into the ‘unitary, multi-ethnic state’ of China.” There are over 30 million Muslims living in China, mostly in the western province of Eastern Turkestan. Hui and Uyghur ethnic minorities are China’s two major groups who are also part of the Muslim community in the country."

A banner is reflected on a polished surface as China's President Xi Jinping (C) speaks during an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 2, 2019. Taiwan's unification with the mainland is ""inevitable"", President Xi Jinping said on January 2, warning against any effort to promote the island's independence and saying China would not renounce the option of military force to bring it into the fold. With détente seeming to settle upon the Korean peninsula, East Asia’s most dangerous flashpoint may now be Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping is morphing into a better dressed version of Mao Zedong and reviving Mao-style policies throughout the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and beyond. One of his targets, the subject of his New Year’s address, is Taiwan. Up until January 1, forty years ago, there were two Chinas. At least, until then the US formally recognised the Republic of China, located on the island of Taiwan, which claimed to be the legitimate government of all China. No one really believed that, and Washington had begun talking with Beijing in 1972. After that countries accelerated their shift in recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The mainland’s diplomatic advantage grew along with its economy. Today just 16 small, mostly African and Latin American nations, recognise the ROC, which has been denied independent status in international organisations as well. However, even that does not satisfy the Xi government, which wants “reunification”. The island has been out of the mainland’s control for more than 120 years, other than a brief period after World War II. On New Year’s Day, Xi gave a major speech addressing Taiwan, expressing his government’s willingness “to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification”. However, he warned: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures [to achieve Beijing’s ends].” Which sounds like American presidents who proclaim that “all options are the table,” code words threatening war. Xi sought to paint a positive picture of Chinese control: “Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.” Alas, he offered no guarantees to preserve Taiwan’s free society and democratic system. Nor would any such promises be believable. Xi’s turn toward totalitarianism, including the incarceration of more than a million Uyghurs in reeducation camps, creates a fearsome prospect for a united future. While he cited Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework as the model, Beijing has steadily tightened its control over that territory, despite pledging to preserve British-style liberties. Even before Xi’s reincarnation as Mao, the Taiwanese people turned decisively against “reunification” with China. A vanishingly small proportion of the young identify with the mainland. Their connection with the PRC is minimal; Taiwan is their home. And they have no reason to voluntarily choose what amounts to a foreign dictatorship, which during its worst times proved to be one of the bloodiest tyrannies in human history. But even if the mainland were democratic, why would the Taiwanese want to be submerged in the neighbouring colossus? Take away the idea of defence against foreign invaders, and the only country threatening to attack Taiwan is the PRC, there is no reason for the former to become just another brick in a Chinese imperial wall. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen spoke a day before Xi, insisting that his government respect Taiwanese liberty and democracy. Her party did badly in the recent elections, but that did not reflect a pro-Beijing surge, rather, domestic issues dominated. Taiwan’s people recognise that a declaration of independence would risk war, so most support today’s ambiguous status. If the Chinese leadership was equally accommodating, the situation would be stable. But Xi, especially, appears determined to force a decision, which risks war and would significantly affect the rest of the region. Although the PRC’s military strength greatly exceeds that of Taiwan, an invasion would be difficult. Washington has, at best, an ambiguous military commitment to Taiwan; the president would not want war with the PRC, but would also be loath to walk away from an ally of more than seven decades. Economic sanctions, at least, would be inevitable; even Europe would likely respond to an attack on the island. Any victory by Beijing would be dearly bought. Instead, all the players need to find a compromise. For instance, while continuing to claim full sovereignty over Taiwan, the PRC should affirm its commitment to peace and withdraw some of its missiles targeted on the island. While preparing to defend itself if necessary, Taipei should eschew policies that highlight its independent existence internationally. While the US should continue selling Taiwan weapons to deter attack, the former should pledge to neither seek bases on the island nor intervene in any conflict which might erupt between Beijing and Taipei. The world is very different to 40 years ago. Unfortunately, the possibility of war over Taiwan is significantly greater today. Any military confrontation would be a disaster to all concerned. Perhaps the best China, Taiwan, and America can do is peacefully kick the controversy down the road — again."

Uighur boy is seen flying a kite in this file photo. The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper reported earlier this week that in the country's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region 1,120,000 civil servants were staying as guests at 1, 690,000 households, most of which are Muslim Uighurs. According to the paper, the officials staying at the houses, ""share their bread, celebrate holidays together, help the children with homework, develop friendships, encourage the feeling of 'National Unity and Family' and take families to Urumqi, the capital of the region for activities."" It was not stated how long the officials remained in the region and stayed with the families and no information was shared about whether the families gave consent to the visits. Among the civil servants staying in the homes of Uighur families, it was reported that there were public officials from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region armed forces, the Armed Police Units and the Chinese central government's representatives. The report also suggested that last year in Xinjiang, encouraged by the officials of the ""National Union and Family"" activities deepened the national unity, strengthening the links between the party officials and the local people, ""the CCP's voice was heard by thousands of families,"" the report added. An official speaking to the paper said, ""The villagers are eagerly looking forward to a modern lifestyle and understanding the good policies of the party. Nowadays, the relationship between the party and the people is rapidly developing. The villagers are ... embracing the modern civilization movement. Their lifestyle has changed and so has their thoughts."" Uighur representatives living outside of China have reacted harshly to the practice, saying officials staying at the houses on behalf of the communist party are actually there to spy on the families. Responding to the allegations, China has strongly refuted any suggestion that it is mistreating the Uighur minority. Previously, Hu Lianhe, a spokesman for China's United Front Work Department, had told a UN panel. ""There is no arbitrary detention or lack of freedom of religion and belief."" ""Xinjiang citizens including the Uighurs enjoy equal freedoms and rights."" Hu said, ""there is no such thing as re-education centres,"" but added criminals convicted of ""minor offences"" have been assigned to ""vocational educational and employment training centres with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation."" ""They are not subject to any arbitrary detention or ill-treatment there,"" Hu added."

People demonstrate against China in front of the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland, on November 6, 2018. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman slammed Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, saying it is a ""great embarrassment"" in a written statement on Sunday. Spokesman Hami Aksoy said, ""Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity."" “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and prisons,” Aksoy said. TRT World's Hasan Abdullah brings more from the Turkish capital Ankara. “Uighurs, who are not detained in the camps, are also under great pressure. Our Uighur-origin citizens living abroad cannot hear from their relatives living in this region,” he added. Turkey invites Chinese authorities to respect fundamental human rights of Uighur Turks and shut down concentration camps, Aksoy said. “We also call on the international community and UN Secretary-General to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang Region,” Aksoy added. He also mentioned about Saturday’s death of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit. “In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said. “This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang Region.” The Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Turkey's expectation from Chinese authorities to consider reactions of Turkish people over serious human rights violations. China’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. China stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Up to 1 million people, or about 7 percent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts. In its last report released on last September, the Human Rights Watch blamed the Chinese government for a “systematic campaign of human rights violations” against Uighur Muslims in northwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the country. According to a 117-page report, the Chinese government conducted “mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment” of Uighur Turks in the region. Islam is one of the five religions officially recognised by the atheist Communist party. The country is home to some 23 million Muslims, but restrictions on them are intensifying. Who is Abdurrehim Heyit ? Abdurrehim Heyit, an Uighur poet and a musician renowned with his songs narrating the Uighur history and culture was born in Kashgar city of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in 1964. Heyit, who studied at a Fine Arts School in Kashgar, became a world-renowned poet in a short time with his songs that he sang with his string instrument. Also known by many people in Turkey, the prominent musician performed a concert at Gazi University in Turkey's capital Ankara, in 2015. Heyit had been detained in Urumqi, in 2017 without being charged with any crime and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  He was in prison when he died."

Members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group are calling on China to post videos of their relatives who have disappeared into a vast system of internment camps.  The social media campaign, launched early Tuesday under the hashtag #MeTooUyghur, follows the release of a Chinese state media video showing famed Uighur musician Abdurehim Heyit, who many believed had died in custody.  ""China, show us their videos if they are alive!"" Halmurat Harri, a Finland-based Uighur activist, wrote on Twitter.  He urged the government to also release videos to prove that others believed detained are in good health amid reports of neglectful and sometimes brutal conditions in the camps.  No camps China has come under increasing scrutiny for the camps holding an estimated one million minority Muslims in its far west Xinjiang region. Former detainees who fled overseas say that while they were held captive, they were ordered to renounce their faith and pledge loyalty to the ruling Communist Party through indoctrination tactics reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. The country has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and UN rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who live predominantly in a region claimed by Uighurs in China, which they call East Turkistan and is home to some 10 million people, most of whom are Muslim. Beijing, which long denied the existence of such facilities, now says they are vocational training centres where Uighurs, Kazakhs and others receive free skills education.  Surveillance cameras, security checkpoints and riot police have become ubiquitous in Xinjiang in recent years, but the government maintains that such measures are necessary to combat separatist violence and latent religious extremism. Turkey on Saturday called China's treatment of Uighurs ""a great cause of shame for humanity.""  Citing reports of Heyit's death, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned the ""concentration camps"" and ""systematic assimilation"" to which Muslims in Xinjiang are subject. At a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called Turkey's statement ""a very bad mistake."" Heyit under investigation Hua said the video of Heyit, released by the state outlet China Radio International, showed that claims of his death were an ""absurd lie.""  She said the renowned musician and poet was being investigated for allegedly endangering national security. The video shows Heyit in a grey sweater against a nondescript, grey wall. He states his name and gives the date as February 10, 2019, then says that he is in good health and has not been abused. The authenticity of the video could not be verified, and it was not clear where and by whom it had been filmed. Many Uighurs outside of China have said they are fearing that their loved ones have been ensnared by the security dragnet, they say they do not even know whether their family members are dead or alive. The mere act of communicating with someone overseas could spur detention, Uighurs say, and as a result, many of their relatives in China have blocked them on social media.  On Twitter, Uighurs abroad posted photos of themselves holding up images of their missing parents, children and siblings. If they are still alive, the posts said, the Chinese government should release videos of them too."

US President Donald Trump, left, gestures as he and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida in this file photo. (April 7, 2017) As leaders of the world's top economic powers seek to defuse tension over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, they will search for common ground on reforms to end a crisis at the institution that was created to prevent economic disputes escalating into war. The World Trade Organization is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional, just when it is most needed to fulfil its role as umpire in trade disputes and as the watchdog of global commerce. ""If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said last week. ""The WTO is doing all it can to support efforts to de-escalate the situation, but finding solutions will require political will and it will require leadership from the G20."" Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing on the effects the US-China trade war has on Chinese exporters.  The WTO has fallen victim to Trump's trade war on economic rival China and the United States has put pressure on the WTO itself to reform. Trump is unhappy with the WTO's failure to hold Beijing to account for failing to open its economy as envisioned when China joined the WTO in 2001. To force reform at the WTO, Trump's team has blocked new appointments to the world's top trade court, the WTO's Appellate Body which is now rapidly running out of judges, meaning it will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. If there are not enough judges, ""disputes go into limbo,"" former Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman said. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States earlier this year. Those, and his tariffs on Chinese imports, have drawn retaliatory tariffs, and represent the kind of dispute the WTO was created to help resolve. Numerous countries have filed litigation at the WTO to contest the tariffs. But if the WTO is unable to rule on them, Trump's aggressive policies cannot be deemed to be illegal and could continue with impunity. The US government has slapped tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to force concessions that would change the terms of trade between the world's two largest economies. Chinese and US officials negotiating easing the trade tensions were making progress on Friday at a Group of 20 summit in Argentina, a Chinese official said. Court with no judges The US metals tariffs have caused a storm because they are based on what Washington says are national security concerns, which makes them exempt from WTO rules. But other countries dispute the link to national security, and are challenging it at the WTO. They fear Trump could use the same reasoning to put import tariffs on cars and other goods. Time is running out because the Appellate Body now has the minimum three members it needs to function and from December 2019 it will be down to one, so only appeals that get underway by that date have a prospect of being resolved. There is a big backlog of cases going through the WTO dispute settlement process, so the metals tariffs are unlikely to be ruled on and appealed within that time frame. ""The new cases of the US duties on steel and aluminium will not be decided... they will not finish before (the end of) 2019,"" former Appellate Body member Giorgio Sacerdoti said. Another major dispute at the WTO concerns the refusal by the European Union and the United States to recognise China as a ""market economy"" whose goods are fairly priced by the market. They say the Chinese state's involvement in the economy has created a steel and aluminium supply glut. China is pursuing legal action against the EU. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said a ruling in China's favour ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO"". That case is also bogged down. Even if the appeal lands in time, there is another potential hitch. The Appellate Body's Chinese member, Hong Zhao, may have to recuse herself because of a potential conflict of interest, which would make it impossible to decide on any appeal in the case, several trade experts told Reuters. ""It’s a very difficult situation for her,"" one diplomat said. Chinese, US, EU and WTO officials declined to comment on whether or not Zhao would need to be recused."

People walk under an electronic board showing stock information at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Lujiazui Financial Area before the visit of Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in Shanghai, China, September 22, 2015 Chinese shares, commodities and the yuan currency jumped on Monday after Chinese and US leaders agreed to a temporary truce in their bitter trade war, but the longer-term outlook for trade relations remains murky. The deal between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping postponed the most pressing threat to the global and Chinese economies - a sharp hike in US tariffs that had been slated for January 1. But analysts cautioned it has only bought a bit more time for wrangling over deeply divisive trade and policy differences, and said China's economy will continue to cool regardless under the weight of weakening domestic demand. Still, the news offered some relief for the country's battered stock markets, which had tumbled over 20 percent at one point this year, prompting a flurry of support measures. At the midday break, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index was 2.9 percent higher and blue-chip shares surged 3.1 percent. Government bond futures fell as shares rallied, with the 10-year treasury futures for March delivery, the most-traded contract, falling 0.26 percent at the open. It was last down 0.07 percent at 96.630. Shares in Hong Kong also jumped, with the Hang Seng index adding 2.7 percent at midday, and breaking through the 27,000 level for the first time since October 4. The China Enterprises Index is 2.8 percent higher at midday. ""This is a relief rally. The markets are oversold. I don't think we needed much of an excuse (for a rebound),"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The agreement ""is not a ceasefire, it's just a de-escalation. The existing tariffs are still having a negative impact on the Chinese economy, they haven't gone away."" The White House said Beijing had agreed to buy an unspecified but ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. It said the two sides would launch new talks to address issues including technology transfer, intellectual property and non-tariff barriers. But the White House also said the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. China praised the ""important consensus"" reached in the deal, but did not mention the 90-day deadline. Despite the differences in the wording and uncertainty about some details, the agreement was a better outcome than investors had expected, said Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities in Shanghai. At the same time, the outcome of the meeting is ""unlikely to immediately spark a turnaround in market sentiment,"" he said. ""While this means the effect of the trade war may pause for a moment, we're still facing domestic issues including slowing growth, and awaiting more information about the direction of macroeconomic policy and eagerly expected measures like tax cuts."" In onshore trade, the yuan was trading at 6.9174 per dollar at midday, after opening at 6.9278. It has lost more than 6 percent of its value so far this year as trade ties deteriorated and the US dollar firmed. The offshore yuan firmed to as high as 6.8950, and was trading at 6.9110 at midday. ""The impact on the yuan was very positive, and has prompted many market participants building up long positions in the Chinese unit,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. ""Such positive sentiment won't fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it's long enough to soothe market sentiment."" Ken Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, was less optimistic. ""The gap between China and the US ... remains quite wide, and it is very difficult for them to reach a comprehensive deal in 90 days,"" Cheung said, adding that he doesn't see ""much further movement"" for the rebound. Commodities also rallied on hopes of thawing relations. Prices of Chinese steel products and steelmaking ingredients soared more than 6 percent. ""We are expecting China to buy more LNG, LPG, corn and soybean to step up imports from US,"" said Michael Mao, energy analyst with consultancyChina Sublime Information Group. ""(The) government is also likely to issue a new import tax on these products to facilitate imports."" But some analysts cautioned about reading too much into Monday's rally. ""The fundamentals haven't changed,"" said Ben Kwong, director of research at KGI Asia in Hong Kong, referring to the day's gains. ""Worries about the trade war have subsided, so investors are shifting their focus back to other things, like a stronger renminbi (or) a lower pace of rate hikes from the Fed."" China's factory activity grew slightly in November, a private survey showed on Monday, but new export orders shrank at a faster pace and manufacturers reported they were cutting prices amid soft domestic demand. The downbeat readings backed Friday's official PMI survey for November which showed growth in the nation's vast factory sector had effectively stalled."

financial officer, calling the case ""extremely nasty."" Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's global chief financial officer, was
arrested in Canada on December 1 and faces extradition to the United

a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions. The executive is the daughter of the founder of Huawei. China summons US envoy to protest detention China summoned the US ambassador to Beijing on Sunday to protest Meng's detention. The official Xinhua News Agency said Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng ""lodged solemn representations and strong protests"" with Ambassador Terry Branstad against the detention. The Xinhua report quoted Le as calling Meng's detention ""extremely egregious"" and demanded the US vacate an order for her arrest.  It quoted Le as calling for the US to ""immediately correct its wrong actions"" and said it would take further steps based on Washington's response. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges
of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a
Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30
years for each charge. No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after
nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the
hearing was adjourned until Monday. In a short statement, China's Foreign Ministry said that
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to
release Meng to Canada's ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to
lodge a ""strong protest."" Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland, said Saturday there is ""nothing to add beyond
what the Minister said yesterday"". Freeland told reporters on Friday that relationship with
China is important and valued, and Canada's ambassador in

arrest of Huawei's CFO, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told
reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship
with Beijing. Canada's arrest of Meng at the request of the United States
while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach
of her lawful rights, Le said. The move ""ignored the law, was unreasonable"" and was in its
very nature ""extremely nasty,"" he added. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately
release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful,
legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full
responsibility for the serious consequences caused."" The statement did not elaborate. ""There will probably be a deep freeze with the Chinese in
high-level visits and exchanges,"" David Mulroney, former
Canadian ambassador to China, said on Friday. ""The ability to talk about free trade will be put in the ice
box for a while. But we're going to have to live with that.
That's the price of dealing with a country like China."" Meng's arrest was on the same day that US President Donald
Trump met in Argentina with China's Xi Jinping to look for ways
to resolve an escalating trade war between the world's two
largest economies. “We are tracking the developments of this case and refer you
to the filings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,” said a
US State Department official, speaking on condition of

Iran may yet survive.,6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"The EU along with Russia and China have opposed the Trump administration on trashing the Iran nuclear deal. Iran may yet survive.  As the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, sanctions were imposed on Tehran. The second phase, which was announced on November 5, was described as some of the most stringent sanctions ever by Trump. This new wave of coercive measures targets critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as energy, shipping and shipbuilding and the financial sectors. Punitive measures are nothing new to the Islamic Republic. The country has been under sanctions by the US for almost 40 years. The Iranian authorities claim they developed the resilience needed to deal with sanctions no matter how tough they are. In this context, President Hassan Rouhani stated: “We will proudly break these illegal, unjust sanctions.” The US often resorts to coercive economic measures as part of its diplomatic pressure on states that do not align with Washington's foreign policy objectives. Such policies are not only meant to show the economic strength and overall dominance of the US as a superpower, but they also intend to provoke uprisings in the poverty-stricken populace. However, there is a gap between theory and practice, and many experts believe that these policies do not break the grip of regimes in power, as seen in the cases of Venezuela, Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea. The more recent sanctions against Russia over Crimea have been entirely futile. Sanctions only harmed the poor people of these countries rather than bringing policy changes by their respective governments, just because the regimes’ ‘centres of gravity’ are usually shielded from the effect of the sanctions. Also, the sanctioned states become a lot more aggressive and use repressive means that thwart any uprising plans. Besides, economic strictures are counter-productive. Iran has lived under different boycotts, and its regime built its political legitimacy on anti-American rhetoric. The authorities will merely use this new wave of sanctions to unite the people under its leadership further. In fact, huge demonstrations already took place on November 4 to protest against the US policies. Despite claims to the contrary, the first affected will be the low-income population and the working class as they are not capable of dealing with the expected impact of the US-imposed measures. The middle class will also have trouble with sanctions due to high inflation rates which will deplete the purchasing power for all Iranians. While Mike Pompeo insisted that sanctions will not involve food, medicine and basic humanitarian goods, US measures have already restricted the transfer of money which affects the importation of food and medicine. The price for medication, such as the one needed for cancer treatment, has become exorbitant. Additionally, Iranians living abroad will also be heavily impacted because of the restrictions on Iran's banking system. SWIFT, the international system for money transfer, removed its access to the Central Bank of Iran. Consequently, countless Iranian students may not be able to receive money transfers from Iran. Interestingly, the US exempted eight countries from sanctions on importing Iranian oil for six months, so they can still do business with Iran. Some observers considered such a step indicates which nations are being treated favourably by Trump. Others estimate that this exemption demonstrates the failure of this policy, which was imposed unilaterally and could not get support from Europe and other countries. Iran has emerged cleared of any wrongdoing in this particular case. Tehran has been committed to the nuclear agreement and has respected its part of the deal. The US, on the other hand, seems to be in breach of international law. Besides, by moving against Tehran unilaterally, the White House is damaging its transatlantic relations and undermining its allies. Consequently, the Trump administration has not won the battle for world public opinion given that it pursues a bellicose course of action without any valid reasons. In the foreseeable future, the United States is not likely to remove sanctions or change course in its approach vis-à-vis Iran. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic will adapt to the new situation by finding ways to export its oil and gas via different routes. The Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his confidence that the Iranian oil industry would find markets. “There are always markets for oil, it depends on the conditions and the price,” he said. “I believe Iran will always sell oil.” Geopolitically, Tehran will seek - more than ever - to damage US client states in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia. The latter has been considerably weakened by its ill-conceived war in Yemen and the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Also, it is predicted that Tehran will get closer to Moscow and cement their strategic relationships. Finally, Tehran will enhance its relations with neighbouring countries, which provide a crucial lifeline for Iran’s economy. These measures mean that Trump’s approach is not only doomed to fail but it also does not serve the purpose for which it was initially intended.      "

In this file photo taken on January 13, 2014 Michael Spavor walks with former US basketball player Dennis Rodman (not in picture) as they are surrounded by the media after arriving at Beijing International Airport from North Korea. China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of ""engaging in activities that endanger the national security"" of China. Lu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living. ""The legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,"" Lu told reporters at a daily briefing. Canada under growing pressure  The two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The US has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud. Canadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor ""since he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,"" Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said Wednesday. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government."" Kovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong. Spavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North's government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North's capital Pyongyang in 2013. Acquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up. ""National security charge"" The detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt's detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada's arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the US. The broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organisations. The root of the dispute appears to be Canada's arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of US sanctions. China earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn't released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of ""retaliatory measures"" if Canada doesn't free Meng. ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,"" Hu Xijin said, speaking in English. Canada asks China for extra security at its embassy Canada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters. The United States and China have emphasised that China-US trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction on Tuesday, saying he'd intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview. The suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump's assertion, saying: ""Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canadais, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law."" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was ""quite obvious"" any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure ""the process is not politicised."" ""Both Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,"" said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney. ""Trump's remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the US's reputation as a country that follows the 'rule of law,' and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks."" Trump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. US regulators planned to bar it from receiving US components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because US tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations. Speaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng's case. ""Let's see what he actually decides,"" Ross said. ""Let's see where we go from there."""

Previously, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained. The detentions came after Canadian police arrested Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a regular news conference in Beijing, China on January 6, 2016. A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, a Canadian newspaper reported on Wednesday, amid a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Ottawa over the arrest of a Chinese telecoms executive. Canada's foreign ministry said it was ""aware of a Canadian citizen"" having been detained, according to the National Post, which cited a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson did not provide further details and did not suggest that the detention was linked to the arrest on December 1 of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the report said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that she had ""not heard"" about the reported detention. The recent detention of two Canadians has raised questions whether Beijing is holding them in retaliation for Meng's arrest, though no link has officially been made between the cases. Meng was released on bail last week in Vancouver pending a US extradition hearing on US fraud charges related to sanctions-breaking business dealings Huawei is alleged to have had with Iran. National security concerns  China has accused the other detainees – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and China-based business consultant Michael Spavor – of activities ""that endanger China's national security."" They were both detained on December 10. Kovrig is a Hong Kong-based senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, while Spavor facilitates trips to North Korea and helped former NBA star Dennis Rodman travel to the neighbouring country. Beijing has threatened Canada with ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not freed and Chinese state-run media have criticised the arrest, saying it was politically motivated. Ottawa has repeatedly said the arrest was not political but rather a judicial process in keeping with an extradition treaty Ottawa has with Washington. But despite escalating tensions between the two countries, the Canadian embassy in China does not seem to be holding back. On Tuesday it posted a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Charter 08, a widely circulated online petition that called for political reform in China, on Chinese social media. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who died last year from liver cancer while in police custody, was arrested after co-authoring the petition, which urged protection of basic human rights and the reform of China's one-party system. "

Trump's surprise announcement late Sunday came a day after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to suspend any new tariffs and give negotiators 90 days to strike a deal. TRT World's Caitlin McGee reports. The ceasefire follows months of tensions and tit-for-tat custom duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods that raised fears of an escalation harmful to the global economy. Both sides gained from hitting the pause button, with Trump securing a Chinese pledge to import more US goods and Xi staving off the further pressure that higher tariffs would place on his country's slowing economy. Trump tweeted that China had agreed to ""reduce and remove"" tariffs of 40 percent on cars, though Beijing has yet to confirm the move. China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%. China's foreign ministry declined to confirm Trump's assertion on Monday, instead saying: ""On December 1 President Xi and President Trump reached an important consensus on trade issues."" ""They agreed to hold off on the imposition of new tariffs and came up with a series of constructive arrangements on how to address the existing differences and problems,"" spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. Trump's tweet did not explain which tariffs would be reduced or removed, or when China would act. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the car announcement, if confirmed, was ""certainly movement in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of more things to come"". Beijing had reduced auto import duties from 25 percent to 15 percent in July. But it later added a 25 percent tariff on US-made cars as trade tensions soared, bringing them to 40 percent. Many US automakers build their cars in China for the local market, but the tariff hikes have hit sales and profits for some companies including electric car-maker Tesla and US-made models from BMW and Ford. IP theft  One expert said China would have to address US complaints about China's forced transfer of intellectual property rights - a major issue at the core of a US ""301"" trade investigation -- for Washington to drop its tariffs. ""Any action which increases market access or better ensures a level playing field will certainly be welcomed and could lead to continued discussions,"" Steven Okun, a Singapore-based senior advisor at strategic advisory firm McLarty Associates, told AFP. ""Still, one must presume that as the existing and proposed tariffs are to spur China to address the US' IPR concerns, only action directly related to that would ultimately impact the 301 tariffs,"" he said. The White House said Saturday the two sides would ""immediately"" begin talks on ""structural changes"" affecting forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection and cyber theft. China reaffirmed that the agreement held ""great significance"". ""It prevents the economic and trade frictions from expanding and opens new prospects for cooperation,"" Geng said. 'No magic wand'  Asian and European stock markets jumped on Monday, with Hong Kong and Shanghai closing sharply higher and the yuan strengthening after months of trade-war turbulence. After being spooked by the conflict, investors returned to buying following the long-awaited meeting between the two presidents. But observers warned there were still major issues that needed to be resolved, including access for US companies and intellectual property protection. ""In order to really make a difference, China needs to enact more sweeping comprehensive reforms in the short term,"" Zarit said. China's state-run media cautiously welcomed the Buenos Aires agreement. The nationalist Global Times tabloid called it a ""momentous step forward"" that brings ""huge potential for fair trade"". ""It is hoped that the trade teams from both countries will reach as many practical agreements as possible and as quickly as possible to hasten China-US cooperation,"" the daily said. Under the agreement, Trump is shelving a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent from the start of next year - but the hike will kick in if negotiators fail to reach a final deal within 90 days. The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and they remain in effect despite the truce. China has hit back with similar tariffs on $110 billion worth of goods made in the US. ""No magic wand has been waved to make the differences between the United States and China vanish overnight,"" the state-run China Daily warned. ""Given the complexity of interactions between the two economies, the rest of the world will still be holding its collective breath while it waits to see if the series of constructive plans that are in the works can put bilateral relations back on a cooperative rather than confrontational track,"" it said."

China's President Xi Jinping listens to his Panamanian counterpart Juan Carlos Varela (not pictured) while delivering a joint message after a private meeting as part of Xi's first state visit to Panama, at Presidential Palace in Panama City, Panama on December 3, 2018. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Portugal on Tuesday for a two-day visit to strengthen ties, amid concern in some EU capitals over China's growing influence on the continent. Fresh from a visit to Spain last week, his two-day stay in Portugal will include a meeting with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and the signing of cooperation agreements. One of them will bring the Portuguese port of Sines, in the southwest, into what China calls the ""new Silk Road"", an initiative that offers loans to build railways, roads and ports across Asia, Europe and Africa. In an op-ed published on Sunday in Portuguese newspapers, President Xi stressed the importance of China's relationship with Portugal as part of a broader network of trade links. But China's growing influence in Europe, welcomed by Greece and several eastern European countries, is viewed warily by others on the continent. At the initiative of France and Germany, EU countries last week agreed a framework regulating foreign investment, particularly from China. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Friday that Lisbon did not back the idea and was relieved that the final accord provided for only an advisory role on the part of the European Commission. Foreign investment does not worry Portugal, and the EU should not ""take the path of protectionism"" in the face of globalisation, he said. Portugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries, was open to Chinese investment after being hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis. Its 78 billion euro ($88 billion) EU-IMF rescue package in 2011 came with required austerity policies - and a wide-ranging privatisation programme that opened the doors to Chinese investment. Chinese investment accounted for 3.6 percent of Portugal's GDP between 2010 and 2016, according to figures from Spain's ESADE business school. China now owns a 28 percent stake in Portuguese energy utility EDP, the country's largest firm, via China Three Gorges and China's state-owned international investment company CNIC. It also has a stake in Portugal's biggest private bank, BCP, and its leading insurance company, Fidelidade. Seeking 'large-scale investment' Perhaps the most contentious issue is China Three Gorges' bid to take a controlling stake in EDP, of which it is already the main stakeholder. The operation, launched in May, involves some nine billion euros. But while it has been welcomed by the Portuguese government it still risks running foul of barriers imposed by regulators in around 15 countries where EDP operates - including the United States. Luis Castro Henriques, head of Portugal's trade and investment agency AICEP, says Chinese investment in Portugal has been good for the country. China has risen to Portugal's 11th-largest trade partner in the decade since 2008, when it was 28th on the list. ""We want now to attract large-scale industrial investment, notably in the automobile and agro-food sectors,"" Castro Henriques said."

The ministry's statement follows a period of relative quiet from Beijing after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. Scepticism on deal The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. But the mood has quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides will be able to reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period that was agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh US tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March. The Commerce Ministry said China-US trade and economic discussions were ""very successful"". The statement did not mention Trump or Xi, however, the state news agency Xinhua later said the ministry statement was hailing their meeting. ""We are confident in implementation...The economic and trade teams from both sides will actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map,"" it said. ""The Chinese side will start with implementing specifics on which there is already consensus, the faster the better."" Deal or tariffs Trump, via Twitter, threatened to place ""major tariffs"" on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. ""We are either going to have a real deal with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future,"" Trump wrote in a post within minutes of the Commerce Ministry statement. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the leaders' meeting, and there have been some differences between US and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails. A Chinese official told Reuters officials were ""waiting for the leaders to return"" before publicising details. President Xi Jinping and his most senior officials, including the commerce minister and the country's two top diplomats, are in Portugal, and due back in China on Thursday. US financial markets tumbled on Tuesday as doubts over what could realistically get accomplished in the tight negotiating window added to concerns about fading global growth."

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani gives a public speech during a trip to the northern Iranian city of Shahroud, Iran, on December 4, 2018. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said US sanctions were ""economic terrorism"", as he sought to foster a united front from visiting regional officials on Saturday. Addressing parliament speakers from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Russia and Turkey, Rouhani said they had all suffered economic pressure from the US. ""We are facing an all-out assault which is not only threatening our independence and identity but also is bent on breaking our longstanding ties,"" he said. The Trump administration in Washington has reimposed an oil embargo and other damaging sanctions on Iran since withdrawing in May from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers. ""America's unjust and illegal sanctions against the honourable nation of Iran have targeted our nation in a clear instance of terrorism,"" Rouhani said. ""Economic terrorism is designed to create panic in the economy of a country and fear in other countries in order to prevent investment."" The conference in Tehran was a second annual meeting of parliament speakers focused on terrorism and regional cooperation. The first was held last December in Islamabad. Most participating countries have faced harsh sanctions and other economic pressure as part of the Trump administration's use of trade as a diplomatic weapon. A brief truce in Trump's trade war with China was again in doubt this week after the arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who was detained in Canada to face fraud charges in the US. Washington has continued to pile fresh sanctions on Russia that began over its military intervention in Ukraine, while two Turkish ministers also faced temporary sanctions this year over the detention of an American pastor. 'We are all punished'  Trump has also cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, accusing it of failing to crack down on militancy. ""When they put pressure on China's trade, we are all harmed... By punishing Turkey, we are all punished. Any time they threaten Russia, we too consider our security to be endangered,"" Rouhani said. ""When they impose sanctions on Iran, they deprive all of us of the benefits of international trade, energy security and sustainable development. And in fact, they impose sanctions on everyone. ""We are here to say that we don't intend to tolerate such insolence."" Rouhani warned Europe - which has strongly objected to the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal - that much is at stake in its efforts to bypass US sanctions and maintain trade with Iran. ""They should know that by sanctioning Iran, they would harm our ability to fight drugs and terrorism,"" Rouhani said, referring to Iran's efforts to combat smuggling, particularly from Afghanistan. The European Union is working on a payment system, known as the ""special purpose vehicle"", to keep money flowing into Iran, but has struggled to find a host since many countries fear repercussions from the Trump administration."

Michael Kovrig, an employee with the International Crisis Group and former Canadian diplomat appears in this photo provided by the International Crisis Group in Brussels, Belgium on December 11, 2018. A former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, two sources said on Tuesday, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release. Michael Kovrig's detention comes after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on December 1 at the request of US authorities, a move that has infuriated Beijing. It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China. ""International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its North East Asia Senior Adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,"" the think-tank said in a statement. ""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,"" it added. China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to questions faxed about Kovrig's detention. The exact reason for the detention, which was made sometime early this week, according to the sources, was not immediately clear. The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa. Calls to Kovrig's phones were not answered. Diplomatic spat Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017. From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Following Meng's arrest, China on Saturday summoned Canada's ambassador in Beijing and warned of severe ""consequences"" if Ottawa did not see that she was immediately released. Meng is set to return to a Vancouver courtroom on Tuesday, as the judge weighs final issues in determining whether she should be freed on bail while awaiting proceedings for her possible extradition to the United States. Washington has made accusations that Meng misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring severe penalties. Locked in a bitter trade war, Washington and Beijing earlier this month agreed to delay a planned January 1 increase in US tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, allowing more time to negotiate over China's huge bilateral trade surplus and US complaints that it steals technology. Chinese experts have said that Beijing was trying to separate Meng's arrest from the trade negotiations, but also warned that public anger in China over Canada's move could compel officials there to take measures that would further sour US-China ties and endanger talks. In 2014, a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, were detained a week after Canada accused China of hacking into the national computer system. Kevin Garratt was charged with spying, but released and deported after he spent two years in detention. "

The Chinese national flag flies in front of a Catholic church in the village of Huangtuang, Hebei province, China, September 30, 2018. A second bishop from China's 'underground' Catholic church is stepping aside and is being replaced by a government-backed clergyman, state-run media reported, amid a thaw in relations between Beijing and the Vatican. There are an estimated 10 million Catholics in China, divided between a government-run association whose clergy are approved by the Communist Party, and the unofficial church which answers to the Vatican. An agreement struck in September on the appointment of bishops has paved the way for a rapprochement between China and the Holy See, which cut off diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1951. Zhuang Jianjian, bishop of the Shantou diocese in southern China will retire and be replaced by Huang Bingzhang, deputy chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the Global Times reported. The Vatican-issued mandate was given to Huang last week by a delegation from Rome that met several Chinese bishops, the state-linked paper reported. ""The mission now is to unite Catholics in the diocese and reduce divergence so as to achieve the common goal of better serving church members,"" Huang told the Global Times. ""This doesn't come as a surprise because Zhuang Jianjian is already 88, so he would have wanted to retire more than a decade ago,"" said Anthony Lam, a Chinese Catholic church expert at Hong Kong's Holy Spirit Study Centre. According to canon laws that govern the Catholic church, bishops ""are requested"" to submit their resignation at the age of 75. The Catholic pope can either approve the resignation or request that they wait for a suitable successor to emerge, Lam said. ""The agreement between China and the Vatican has solved this problem because the seven bishops previously excommunicated have been restored to the church, so Huang Bingzhang will be able to take up the position."" The Vatican excommunicated Huang in 2011 for being ordained as a bishop without papal approval. This is a slightly different situation from that of fellow underground bishop Guo Xijin, who was last week asked to step aside in the eastern Fujian province to make way for government-approved clergy, Lam noted. Guo instead will serve as ""auxiliary bishop"" – someone who assists and works alongside the diocesan bishop – while both the unofficial and official churches of the diocese will merge. Guo's case was at the centre of last week's negotiations between China and the Vatican, which have been asking him to leave his post since 2017 to allow for talks aimed at ending their decades-old spat. Separately, the official church said it is facing a lack of bishops and called for ""politically reliable"" clergymen with ""good ethics,"" the Global Times reported on Wednesday. Nearly half of China's 98 Catholic dioceses have no leaders, chairman of the China Bishops Conference Ma Yinglin told a seminar, according to the paper."

Eight people were killed and 22 injured after a hijacked bus crashed into pedestrians in east China's Fujian province on Tuesday afternoon, state media reported. A hijacker carrying a knife had been detained and was being investigated by local police, state television CGTN reported. A video posted by Duowei news, a Chinese media outlet based in the US, showed several injured people lying on the street near a crashed bus.  It also showed police wrestling a person to the ground. Blood could also be seen on the steps of the bus, which had been stopped in the middle of a road. State-run news agency Xinhua reported the suspect was a 48-year-old local man surnamed Qiu. He had attacked a female passenger before taking control of the bus, Duowei reported. Police said that on the day of the attack the suspect had quarrelled with a local official who had visited his home, adding that the pair had a long history of conflict, according to the Xinhua report. The 22 wounded in the attack were taken to local hospitals, with one person being treated for ""serious injures"", Xinhua said. Spate of attacks China has suffered a spate of similar incidents this year. In late November, a car ploughed into a group of children crossing a street in front of an elementary school in the northeastern Liaoning province, killing five people and injuring at least 19. The driver said he ""chose his victims at random"" and had reportedly been contemplating suicide due to domestic troubles before the tragedy occurred. In October, three people were killed when a man fleeing after committing a stabbing drove into a crowd and attacked onlookers in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The month before, a man ploughed a truck into a crowd in Hunan province and went on a rampage, attacking onlookers with knives and a shovel. Eleven died and 44 were injured. Grisly car accidents are common in China, where transportation authorities have struggled to uphold safety regulations – which are often flouted or go unenforced. According to authorities 58,000 people were killed in accidents across the country in 2015 alone. Last month, at least 13 people died when a bus plunged off a bridge in Chongqing municipality, after the driver got into a fist fight with a passenger who had missed her bus stop. Search and rescue teams dispatched more than 70 boats, as well as a team of scuba divers and underwater robots, to find the wreckage and retrieve bodies from the water."

As a partial shutdown of the US government entered its eighth day, with no quick end in sight, the Republican president was in Washington, sending out tweets attacking Democrats and talking up possibly improved relations with China. The two nations have been in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies has been disrupted by tariffs. Trump and Xi agreed to a ceasefire in the trade war, deciding to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting December 1 while they negotiate a deal to end the dispute following months of escalating tensions. Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute.

Xinhua said Vice Premier Liu He will hold talks with Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. A lower-level round of talks between the US and China will take place in Washington on Tuesday, the White House said on Monday. The talks follow a round of negotiations that ended in Beijing last week without a deal but which officials said had generated progress on contentious issues between the world's two largest economies. The talks are aimed at ""achieving needed structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China. The two sides will also discuss China's pledge to purchase a substantial amount of goods and services from the United States,"" the White House said in a statement. Both governments have expressed optimism but they have given no details of their talks.

TRT World,https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/slowly-but-surely-china-is-moving-into-afghanistan-12715872,"Slowly but surely, China is moving into Afghanistan","As the war in Afghanistan winds down, China looks to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.",6 YEARS AGO,<built-in method now of type object at 0x00007FFB6BF17B60>,China News,TRT World,China,"As the war in Afghanistan winds down, China looks to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.  In 2013, Chinese president Xi Jinping inaugurated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vast network of infrastructure projects spanning more than 60 countries. But the BRI largely excludes Afghanistan, moving through Central Asia and Pakistan instead. That may now be changing. China has steadily increased its involvement in Afghanistan in recent years, and a nascent peace process offers some hope that stability might return to the country, bringing with it the possibility of greater trade and investment. This shift is reflected in a major new report on the BRI’s expansion into Afghanistan by the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies (DROPS), a Kabul-based think tank. The 15-month research project has amassed a vast amount of material gleaned from multiple sources, including previously undisclosed government documents and interviews with high-ranking Afghan officials, making it by far the most comprehensive treatment of Afghanistan’s potential role in the BRI to date. “Looking at the BRI map, it seemed that it was bypassing Afghanistan,” said Mariam Safi, Director of DROPS and one of the report’s co-authors. “So, we wanted to know if there is any thinking in the Afghan government and stakeholders here on the BRI when it comes to Afghanistan’s potential linkage”. Afghanistan should fit well into the BRI. It has a serious infrastructure deficit, making it an ideal candidate for Chinese investment. It is also the shortest route between Central Asia and South Asia, and between China and the Middle East, while also serving as a gateway to the Arabian Sea. But China’s role in Afghanistan in the past two decades has been limited. It did not contribute troops to the US-led war that began in 2001, and Beijing has so far refrained from the sorts of big-ticket investments planned for other neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Kazakhstan. But its economic footprint has expanded. China is now Afghanistan’s largest business investor, it has pledged increasing amounts of aid to the country, and Chinese companies have been involved in construction projects. Beijing has also shown some interest in Afghanistan’s cornucopia of natural resources, which includes vast deposits of essential minerals such as lithium (used in mobile phone batteries). The country’s weak logistics and security situation make it difficult to extract and transport these resources. But China has got its foot in the door, winning rights to Amu Darya Basin oil in the north and the massive Mes Aynak copper mine near Kabul. Moreover, Beijing has taken modest steps to include Afghanistan in the BRI. In 2016 Beijing and Kabul signed a Memorandum of Understanding. China has reportedly pledged at least $100 million in funding. However, this is a tiny amount compared to the vast sums proposed for other countries, like Pakistan. And, according to Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), “We still don’t see large projects going forward that quickly on the ground.” But there has been some progress. In September 2016, for example, the first direct freight train from China reached the Afghan border town of Hairatan. An air corridor linking Kabul and the Chinese city of Urumqi has also been launched under the BRI. Then, in May 2017, Afghan officials attended the massive Belt and Road Forum in China, and in October Afghanistan joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which funds BRI projects. Kabul has made connectivity a key pillar of its foreign policy, launching various infrastructure projects that could eventually be “brought under the BRI fold,” Mariam Safi tells TRT World. Reluctant bedfellows  One such initiative is the Five Nations Railway running from China to Iran via Afghanistan, which is still at the feasibility study stage but aligns well with Beijing’s priorities in the Belt and Road. Another is a planned north-south railway corridor that would connect Kunduz with Torkham on the Pakistani border. Afghanistan has bold plans to expand its almost non-existent railway network. According to internal Afghan government documents reviewed by DROPS, China has pledged “huge support” for these efforts. The north-south railway could facilitate the transport of natural resources while also connecting to Pakistan.  Furthermore, there are various energy projects which could fit well into the Belt and Road vision, such as CASA-1000 and TAP-500 that would export surplus electricity from Central Asia to energy-starved South Asia via Afghanistan, or the TAPI gas pipeline, whose Afghan segment began construction last year (although there is reason to doubt its progress). Another project that could be included in BRI is the Digital Silk Road fibre optic cable network, funded by China, the US and other partners, which has already connected at least 25 provinces in Afghanistan while aiming to link to China, South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, according to DROPS. China has generally eschewed a leadership role in Afghanistan, preferring to work with foreign partners. Some projects, including the Five Nations Railway and Lapis Lazuli Corridor, are jointly financed by China and multilateral lending institutions such as the ADB. “There has been a lot of cooperative activity on the ground,” Raffaello Pantucci told TRT World, and Beijing seems to view Afghanistan as a place where it can “test out” difficult relationships. China has collaborated with the US there, despite tensions between the two countries, and recently agreed to cooperate with its rival, India. Sino-Indian efforts in Afghanistan face a hurdle, though, in the form of Beijing’s close relationship with Delhi’s nemesis, Pakistan. 2015 saw the inauguration of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a vast energy and infrastructure project involving more than $60 billion of potential investment. CPEC was intended to be the Belt and Road’s “flagship” corridor, and, as such, it is already more advanced than other components of the BRI. According to the report, CPEC is “one of the most feasible options” for integrating Afghanistan into the BRI. There are some cross-border rail and road links at varying stages of development. While none of these is near completion, China clearly wants to move forward. In 2017 Beijing convened a trilateral dialogue with Pakistan and Afghanistan partly to discuss extending CPEC, but also to ameliorate the rocky relationship between its two neighbours, which has seen border closures and skirmishes. These efforts paid off, as Afghan-Pakistani relations improved in 2018, with a new cooperation agreement in May. Afghan officials interviewed by DROPS were generally “positive” about CPEC, the report says, but some were wary of excessive dependence on Pakistan. Indeed, as relations with Islamabad soured in recent years, Kabul has diversified its trade away from Pakistan to Iran. However, the officials were clear “across the board” that Afghanistan still needs Pakistan because it provides the quickest route to the sea, according to Mariam Safi. And, vice versa, Pakistan hopes that Afghanistan may eventually provide access to Central Asian markets. “At the end of the day there was the realisation that both countries need each other,” Safi told TRT World. Neither the Afghan nor Pakistani governments responded to requests for comment. Increasing Chinese footprint While China’s economic role in Afghanistan has increased, its security presence has grown even more. As the US started withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in 2011, the country became increasingly unstable, raising the risk that insecurity would spill out into Central Asia and Pakistan, potentially disrupting China’s Belt and Road projects there. Beijing has also been concerned about what they call the threat posed by Uighur and other terrorists using Afghanistan as a base for attacks against the Chinese mainland. In response, China has intensified security on its border, reportedly engaging in joint patrols with Afghan forces and building a base in Badakhshan province, while also launching the Quadrilateral Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism (QCCM) with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan. To counter instability in Afghanistan, China has also stepped up its involvement in peace talks to end the war. Since 2015, it has been involved in a number of multilateral initiatives, including the Quadrilateral Coordination Group and, more recently, the Moscow Format. Beijing has cultivated good ties with the Taliban, meeting them several times in 2018 alone. Peace may now be on the horizon. The Trump administration has made unprecedented progress in its efforts to negotiate with the Taliban, reaching a provisional agreement in January. The Afghan government still needs to join the talks, however, and there is a long road ahead. For Beijing, peace would not only reduce the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan, but it could also boost Chinese economic activity. “Afghanistan has been peripheral to the Belt and Road because it simply hasn’t been possible to pursue a serious economic agenda there,” said Andrew Small, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the US and author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia's New Geopolitics. “If there is a political settlement, that could change – though China will still tread very carefully until it’s clear that any settlement holds.” At the launch of the DROPS report in January, Beijing’s new ambassador to Kabul, Liu Jinsong, said that China was facilitating peace talks to enable Afghanistan’s integration into the BRI, describing the country as a “vital partner” in the initiative. The appointment of Mr Jinsong, a former director of the Silk Road Fund, “shows that Beijing now considers Afghanistan a priority and wants to include it firmly in its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),” according to the Berlin-based thinktank, MERICS. While there is still a long way to go, Beijing is entering a new phase of engagement with its neighbour. “It is certainly true that China is playing a much greater (and higher profile) role in Afghanistan,” said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at the University of Oxford, whose latest book, The New Silk Roads, examines emerging forms of connectivity in Asia. “My best guess is that this really is a case of a new page being turned,” Frankopan told TRT World. The Chinese embassy in Kabul could not be reached for comment. Asked to comment on CPEC’s possible extension to Afghanistan, China’s deputy chief of mission in Islamabad, Zhao Lijian, referred TRT World to a recent interview in which he described Chinese plans to facilitate trade and ease tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan."

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen during the New Year press conference in Taipei, Taiwan. January 1, 2019. Taiwan will not accept any deal that destroys its sovereignty and democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday after the island's opposition KMT party said it could sign a peace deal with China if it wins a presidential election next year. China claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island, which it regards as sacred territory, under Beijing's control, by force if necessary. While China has not broached the idea of a peace deal in years, the chairman of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), Wu Den-yih, said last week the party could sign a peace deal with China if it won the hotly contested election. ""Taiwan society will not accept any treaty that harms Taiwan's national sovereignty and democracy,"" Tsai told reporters in Taipei. She said there won't be real peace unless China rules out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing was expected to make fresh overtures to the KMT ahead of the elections, security sources in Taiwan's government familiar with the matter told Reuters, a move they said could isolate Tsai's government and sway the election results. Losing out in polls Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party suffered stinging losses to the KMT in mayoral and local elections in November. Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo, has said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect Taipei's democratic values. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies. Tsai has repeatedly called for international support to defend Taiwan's democracy and way of life in the face of China's renewed threats. "

In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before proceeding to their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Friday, February 22, 2019. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented a $10 billion deal for a refining and petrochemical complex in China on Friday, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping who urged joint efforts to counter extremism and terror. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, arrived on Thursday on an Asia tour that has already seen the kingdom pledged investment of $20 billion in Pakistan and seek to make additional investments in India's refining industry. ""China is a good friend and partner to Saudi Arabia,"" President Xi Jinping told the crown prince in front of reporters. ""The special nature of our bilateral relationship reflects the efforts you have made,"" added Xi, who has made stepping up China's presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia's relations with China dated back ""a very long time in the past."" ""In the hundreds, even thousands, of years, the interactions between the sides have been friendly. Over such a long period of exchanges with China, we have never experienced any problems with China,"" he said. Crown Prince Mohammed, who has come under fire in the West following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October, said Saudi Arabia saw great opportunities with China. ""The Silk Road initiative and China's strategic orientation are very much in line with the kingdom's Vision 2030,"" he said according to SPA, referring to Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform programme. Trade between the countries increased by 32 percent last year, he said. Saudi Arabia also said it was working to add Chinese to the curriculum in Saudi schools and universities. ""The introduction of Chinese to the curriculum is an important step towards the opening of new horizons for students,"" the government said in a statement. China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh, since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi Arabia's regional foe, Iran. China is also wary of criticism from Muslim countries about its camps in the heavily Muslim far western region of Xinjiang, which the government says are for de-radicalisation purposes and rights groups call internment camps. Xi told the crown prince the two countries must strengthen international cooperation on de-radicalisation to ""prevent the infiltration and spread of extremist thinking,"" Chinese state TV reported. Saudi Arabia respected and supported China's right to protect its own security and take counterterror and de-radicalisation steps, the crown prince told Xi, according to the same report, and was willing to increase cooperation. Meeting the crown prince earlier on Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said the two countries should enhance exchanges on their experiences in de-radicalisation, China's official Xinhua news agency said in a separate report. Chinese state media made no direct mention of Xinjiang in their stories on the crown prince's meetings. Deals signed Aramco agreed to form a joint venture with Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in the northeastern Chinese city of Panjin, saying the project was worth more than $10 billion. The partners would form a company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Co as part of a project that would include a 300,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery with a 1.5-million-metric tonnes per year ethylene cracker, Aramco said. Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the crude feedstock for the complex, which is expected to start operations in 2024. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, a position Russia has held for the last three years. Saudi Aramco is set to boost market share by signing supply deals with non-state Chinese refiners. Aramco also signed an agreement to buy a nine percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, Saudi state news agency SPA said . This formalised a previously announced plan to gain a stake in a 400,000-bpd refinery and petrochemicals complex in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai. China sees ""enormous potential"" in Saudi Arabia's economy and wants more high-tech cooperation, State Councillor Wang Yi, the Chinese government's top diplomat, said on Thursday. But China was not seeking to play politics in the Middle East, the widely read state-run tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial. ""China won't be a geopolitical player in the Middle East. It has no enemies and can cooperate with all countries in the region,"" said the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily. ""China's increasing influence in the Middle East comes from pure friendly cooperation. Such a partnership will be welcomed by more countries in the Middle East."""

Flags fly as members of Egyptian security forces stand guard before the start of a summit between Arab league and European Union member states, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, February 24, 2019. Leaders from European Union and Arab League countries pledged on Sunday to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to tackle unauthorised migration at a first-ever summit high in symbolism but likely to yield few concrete results. Under tight security at the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi opened two days of talks with a speech celebrating what he described as historic cooperation between the two organizations. But despite the public display of unity, just drafting a summit statement has proved difficult.  EU and Arab League foreign ministers failed to agree earlier this month on a text after Hungary objected to the section on migration. Europe's migration challenge is at the heart of the two-day meeting, being held under the slogan ""Investing in Stability.""  Desperate to bring migrant arrivals under control, the EU offered the summit last October as a symbolic sweetener to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi. What EU wants from Sisi The EU wants Sisi to order the Egyptian coast guard to pick up migrants leaving Libya and take them back to the African mainland, ensuring they do not become Europe's responsibility. Sissi, in turn, receives high-profile European recognition, promotion for Sharm el Sheikh, and is likely to avoid any lessons on human rights. While the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean has now dropped to a seven-year low, Europe's inability to agree on how to manage the arrivals has sparked a major political crisis, as nations bicker over who should take responsibility and whether other EU partners should help out.  Some, like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary, claim that extremists are entering among the refugees. Praises for Egypt  Just days before the summit, the head of the EU's border and coast guard agency praised the authorities in Cairo for preventing any migrant from setting out for Europe from the Egyptian coast since 2016. ""There are no boats coming directly from Egypt to the European Union,"" Frontex director Fabrice Leggeri said. ""The cooperation with Egypt is really encouraging and is developing."" The EU routinely trumpets an agreement it reached with Turkey for slowing migrant arrivals to a trickle in exchange for up to 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in aid for Syrian refugees there and other incentives. It has pledged to replicate the deal in northern Africa. Ahead of this inaugural summit, experts and European officials played down any expectation of major results. Important timing ""The timing is very important because it comes after eight years of instability in the Mediterranean affecting Europe and the Middle East,"" Saeed Sadek, professor of political sociology at the Canadian University in Cairo told The Associated Press. ""Both sides want to know how can we stabilise the area further, produce stability, how can we deal with the consequences and prevent any further escalations,"" said Sadek. ""But the imbalance of power between the two sides may not produce the concrete results that people imagine."" May to seek Saudi influence in Yemen British Prime Minister Theresa May will call on Saudi Arabia's King Salman to use his influence to encourage Yemeni parties towards peace, telling a summit that governments must redouble efforts to secure a political settlement to the crisis. ""My message in Sharm el Sheikh is clear: let us now redouble our efforts to build on the progress made and get the Stockholm agreements implemented in full,"" May said on the way to the EU-League of Arab states summit in Egypt. ""I will also use this summit to reiterate to King Salman the importance of Saudi Arabia continuing to use their influence to encourage the Yemeni parties towards peace, as they did so pivotally in Stockholm. And I will underline the UK's ongoing commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia and the region."" The war in Yemen has largely been stalemated for years, with a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states and Yemeni allies unable to dislodge the Houthi movement that controls the capital and most major population centres. A ceasefire was agreed at talks at a castle near Stockholm last month.  The agreement also foresees a political track of talks to end the war. But a lack of progress could test the patience of the United Arab Emirates, which leads military operations on Yemen's Red Sea coast for the Saudi-led coalition"

(January 30, 2019) US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will extend a deadline to escalate tariffs on Chinese imports, citing ""substantial progress"" in weekend talks between the two countries. Trump tweeted that there had been ""productive talks,"" adding that ""I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1."" I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues.

Trump said that if negotiations progress, he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida resort to finalise an agreement. Speaking to governors gathered at the White House for an annual black-tie ball on Sunday, Trump said he was doing ""very well"" with China. ""If all works well we're going to have some very big news over the next week or two,"" he said, though he took care to add that ""we still have a little ways to go."" The reprieve is likely to be greeted with relief by financial markets. US and Chinese negotiators met through the weekend as they seek to resolve a trade war that has rattled financial markets. Trump had warned he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on $200 billion in Chinese imports, from 10 to 25 percent, if the two sides failed to reach a deal. The increase was scheduled to take effect at 12:01 am EST (05:01 GMT) on March 2. Kate Fisher has more from Washington DC. Mounting pressure The world's two biggest economies have been locked in a conflict over US allegations that China steals technology and forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in an aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance. The two counties have slapped import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods. The conflict has shaken financial markets and clouded the outlook for the global economy, putting pressure on Trump and Xi to reach a deal. ""Trump clearly wants a deal and so do the Chinese, which certainly raises the probability that the two sides will come to some sort of negotiated agreement, even if it is a partial one, in the coming weeks,"" said Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. But business groups and lawmakers in Congress want to see a comprehensive deal that forces the Chinese to change their behaviour and can be enforced."

Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu voiced concern on Monday at China's alleged mistreatment of Uighurs and other Muslims in the East Turkistan region.  He also called for authorities to protect freedom of religion and cultural identity. Without specifically mentioning mass detention camps reported to hold one million Muslims – which China says are centres for vocational education – Cavusoglu told the UN Human Rights Council [UNHRC] that ""reports regarding human rights violations against Uighurs and other Muslim communities in East Turkistan are serious cause for concern."" ""We encourage Chinese authorities and expect that universal human rights, including freedom of religion, are respected and full protection of the cultural identities of the Uighurs and other Muslims is ensured,"" he told the Geneva forum. China has rejected all accusations of mistreatment in the camps. A distinction should be made between ""terrorists and innocent people,"" Cavusoglu said, adding, ""And I have to underline that we support the One China policy."" Discrimination  The East Turkistan region is home to around 10 million Uighurs.  The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of the region's population, has long accused Chinese authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination. Up to one million people, or about seven percent of the Muslim population in the East Turkistan region, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of ""political re-education"" camps, according to US officials and UN experts. Families of missing Uighurs speak out Nearly two years after the Chinese government began to detain members of Muslim minority groups in western China, a growing number of family members abroad are refusing to remain silent. On Sunday, about three dozen relatives of some of the Uighurs, Kazakhs and others being held without charge, spoke out about the mass detentions at an event in Washington, DC, hoping to raise awareness of what many are calling a human rights travesty. ""If you know someone who is missing, it is time to speak up,"" said Ferkat Jawdat, a Virginia-based software engineer. He's lost contact with his 52-year-old mother in East Turkistan. For members of the Uighur diaspora, losing a family member into the sprawling system has become all too common. Jawdat co-organised Sunday's gathering so that Uighurs in the US could start collecting information on their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and even children whose whereabouts are unknown.  They plan to present the data to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the US State Department. Raising awareness  Some of the attendees have confirmation that their loved ones are detained in East Turkistan. Others have simply lost contact — and fear the worst. ""We want to raise awareness about what can happen to American families — many of these people here are American citizens,"" said Jawdat, a US citizen who helped organise the event, held in the basement of a public library. Similar gatherings took place concurrently in eight other countries, including Turkey, France, Germany, Australia and Canada."

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would consider extending the deadline for a trade deal with China beyond March 1. ""If we're close to a deal, where we think we can make a real deal...

And while no date has yet been agreed for a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, he said he expects that to happen ""at some point."" The high-stakes dispute has raised concerns it could spill over into the global economy after Trump last year hit China with 25 percent punitive tariffs on $50 billion in goods, and then imposed 10 percent duties on another $200 billion in annual imports. The rate on all those imports are set to increase to 25 percent if no agreement is reached by March 1. China's economy already has shown signs of slowing, while the trade war has shaken the confidence of US businesses, as retaliatory tariffs have raised prices and helped choke off a key export market. And Trump's aggressive strategy has failed to produce a reduction in the US trade deficit with China, which he set as a primary goal. He repeated the incorrect statement that China is paying the duties, which in fact are paid by US companies importing goods. And economists say much of the intended effect of the duties in reducing imports, has been offset by the devaluation of China's currency, which makes goods cheaper for importers."

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laughs as he attends a meeting with Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs (not pictured) in the ministry building in Budapest, Hungary, February 11, 2019. When US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary this week to shore up long-standing relations, he also came with a warning for his NATO partners; that they are the targets of a campaign by Russia and China to divide the West. Arriving in Bratislava yesterday, Pompeo reminded Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajack of his country’s history of oppression under four decades of communism and “the aggressive role Russia continues to play in the region”. Invoking Russia’s annexation of Crimea, he encouraged Central Europe to embrace closer defence ties with the US and to become more aware of political manipulation from Moscow. “Russia and China are authoritarian powers who do not share our joint aspirations of freedom,” he said during a joint news conference in Budapest on Monday with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Poland and Hungary in particular are seen as increasingly undemocratic countries with right-wing governments that have cosied up to Russia and China in recent years. Earlier this month, Washington-based think tank Freedom House downgraded Hungary from ""free"" to ""partly free"" in its annual freedom survey, making it the only EU country in that category. ""We must not let Putin drive wedges between friends in NATO,"" Pompeo continued. In the first visit by a US secretary of state in eight years, Pompeo placed part of the blame on the US and its absence from the region. “Secretary Pompeo needs to treat this trip not as a friendly meeting between allies, but as an opportunity to have a frank conversation with a state increasingly at odds with both American interests and its human rights obligations,” Human Rights First said in a statement. While Hungary would go on to sign a defence cooperation agreement with the US on Monday, as well as agreeing to buy US military equipment, the trip would not come without tension, with Szijjarto stating that Budapest has grown tired of the West’s “enormous hypocrisy” with regards to Russia. At the same time, Pompeo managed to raise eyebrows by stating a US intention to fight corruption and strengthen support for independent media in all the Visegrad Four (V4) countries. Each of the V4 countries (the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary) have been accused of large-scale government corruption in recent years, while Hungary and Poland in particular have decimated media outlets that are critical of the government. “If you look at the Hungarian media, the independents are against the rightist government – they have labelled them as socialist-liberal – so [in the new US position] there is certainly an ideological underpinning,” Balazs Jarabik, a nonresident scholar of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Europe think-tank, told TRT World. He said that while the US would most likely focus on countering a mass anti-EU disinformation campaign perpetrated by Moscow in recent years, it was nonetheless inappropriate for them to tamper with the media landscape of sovereign countries. “Yes, the Hungarian government controls most of the media, about 60 percent, but does not control the public opinion. Whether it is the job of the Americans to strengthen independent media, I don’t think so,” he said. In Hungary on Monday, Pompeo also warned Europe that using technology from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei could hurt their relationship with the United States, adding that it has an obligation to alert other governments to the risks of building networks with equipment from the mobile operator. His statement comes amid the latest efforts to push Huawei out of lucrative fifth generation (5G) contracts around the world over what it believes to be serious security threats. Despite security concerns, Hungary and Slovakia have remained in Huawei’s corner, saying the company does not pose such a threat in their countries. Jarabik said Pompeo’s statement has more to do with protecting American business interests in a region that has been increasingly looking elsewhere. “This is a part of selling American. Pompeo and the Americans have proved to be a very effective salesmen and this is all about that,” he said."

Men used pikes and shovels to dig into the mud since the soaked ground was unstable and limited the use of heavy equipment on site. TRT World's
Arabella Munro has more.  Philippine death toll feared to rise In the Philippines, casualties reported by various agencies on Sunday evening indicate the death toll from the impact of Mangkhut could exceed 50, with most killed in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region. Francis Tolentino, an advisor to President Rodrigo Duterte and head of the government's disaster coordination, said the latest number of casualties was 33 dead and 56 missing. TRT World's Natasha Hussain reports. But the head of the military's Northern Luzon Command, Emmanuel Salamat, told Reuters that at least 19 more were killed in landslides in one part of Benguet province. The 19 who died were part of a bigger group of 43 people, likely miners, and those who were still alive were feared to be trapped in an old mining bunkhouse that had collapsed under rubble, according to Tolentino. Search and rescue missions were ongoing, and a local mayor in Benguet, Victorio Palangdan, said he feared the number killed there could be more than 100. Separately, the coastguard said it had recovered the bodies of three people. In Macau, which halted casino gambling late on Saturday and put China's People's Liberation Army on standby for disaster relief help, some streets were flooded. ""The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,"" said authorities in the world's largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage. Earlier, TRT World spoke to Hong Kong-based journalist Patrick Fok for more details. ""King of storms"" The typhoon, dubbed the ""King of Storms"" by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5:00 pm. local time, packing winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), weather officials said. Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas were also reduced as a precaution. In Shenzhen, electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday. The storm has fuelled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output, at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop. Guangdong is also China's most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million. The airport in the boomtown of Shenzhen has been shut since midnight, and will be closed until 8:00 am. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have been cancelled in Guangzhou and the neighbouring island province of Hainan. High winds and swells have also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 metres (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. Mangkhut's northwesterly track will bring heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday, before it weakens into a tropical depression to reach southwestern Yunnan next day."

China's President Xi Jinping attends the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge at the Zhuhai Port terminal on October 23, 2018. China’s President Xi Jinping launched the world’s longest sea bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China Tuesday at a time when Beijing is tightening its grip on its semi-autonomous territories. Xi announced the bridge officially open at a ceremony also attended by Hong Kong’s and Macau’s city leaders at a new port terminal in the southern mainland city of Zhuhai. “I declare the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge officially open,” Xi said as digital fireworks exploded on a screen behind him in an indoor ceremony, before leaving the stage immediately. He did not address the audience. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam had earlier spoken to thank Xi for attending in person, praising the bridge’s “magnificence”. It is the second major infrastructure project tying Hong Kong to mainland China to launch in a matter of weeks, after the opening of a high-speed rail link last month, and is part of a Beijing-driven strategy to create a sprawling “Greater Bay Area” economic hub. Critics say the new multi-billion-dollar sea-bridge is one more way to integrate Hong Kong into China as fears grow that the city’s cherished freedoms are being eroded. The mega bridge will open to traffic on Wednesday. Building began in 2009 and has been dogged by delays, budget overruns, corruption prosecutions and the deaths of construction workers. The launch ceremony was hastily announced last week by mainland authorities with Hong Kong lawmakers and transport companies complaining they had been left in the dark. Supporters of the project promote it as an engineering marvel that will also boost business and cut travel time, while others see it as a politically driven and costly white elephant. The main bridge section is considered mainland territory and Hong Kong cars and drivers travelling over it “must comply with the laws and regulations of the mainland”, according to the city’s transport department. ""It’s magnificent"" There was no ceremony on the Hong Kong side Tuesday, but there was a heightened police presence in coastal areas near the bridge, with officers carrying out identity checks on journalists and members of the public. Hong Kong residents will only be granted a licence to cross into Zhuhai by car if they meet highly selective criteria, including holding certain mainland government positions or making major contributions to charities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Most people will need to travel the bridge on coaches and buses. Online commenters in Hong Kong complained about the bridge’s restricted access ahead of the launch. “Such a huge investment using the Hong Kong taxpayer’s money... yet basically it is not open to us at all,” said one comment on the South China Morning Post website. But residents in Zhuhai welcomed the bridge. “I think this bridge will bring great convenience to the whole area of Zhuhai, Hong Kong and Macao, and promote the economic development of the whole area of the Pearl River Delta,” resident Dang Zheiliang told AFP. Resident Can Binghua paid a visit to the bridge on his day off. “Today I’m off duty, so I took my child to see the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Now it’s almost open to traffic. It’s magnificent,” he told AFP. Some Hong Kong media reported that the physical condition of bus drivers would be monitored by cameras, including an alert sent if a driver yawns more than three times in 20 seconds. China already lays claim to the record for the world’s longest bridge of any kind — the Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge, a viaduct which is part of a high-speed rail line. The opening of the high-speed rail link last month also sparked criticism as it saw Chinese security stationed on Hong Kong soil for the first time at the city’s terminus. Critics accused the Hong Kong government of giving away territory to an increasingly assertive Beijing."

China's Premier Li Keqiang (L) gestures as he speaks with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as they arrive to pose for a family photograph during an ASEM summit at the European Council in Brussels on October 19, 2018. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe makes a rare trip to China on Thursday hoping improved relations will lead to new economic partnerships, as the two countries come under US pressure on trade. The visit is the first by a Japanese premier since 2011 and is part of a years-long process of repairing ties in the wake of a disastrous falling-out in 2012, when Tokyo “nationalised” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. The incident prompted anti-Japanese riots in China, and kicked off a frosty spell that has only gradually and recently begun to thaw. TRT World's Samantha Vadas reports. Since an awkward 2014 encounter between Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit, there have been ministerial visits by both sides and a softening of rhetoric. But Abe’s trip will be a test of how far the two countries have come, and the need for progress is all the more urgent as US President Donald Trump levies tariffs and rattles sabres on trade with both China and Japan. “The trade war with the US seems like it’s helping bring them together a bit,” said Kristin Vekasi, assistant professor of political science at the University of Maine, and an expert on Japan-China ties. “In that sense, they’re actually on the same side... and if Japan leans away from the US because of decreased economic opportunities, there’s a potential for closer ties with China,” she told AFP. Complementary economies The two leaders are likely to focus on a range of potential deals, including joint investments in infrastructure in regional nations including Indonesia and the Philippines. Abe has signalled some interest in China’s massive “Belt and Road Initiative”, which funds major infrastructure work, but experts said a concrete deal on Japanese participation was unlikely for now. Both sides are keen to improve economic cooperation, with Japanese business eager for increased access to China’s massive market, and Beijing interested in Japanese technology and corporate knowhow. “Japan and China have really nicely complementary economies, and they can benefit hugely from having closer trade and investment ties,” said Vekasi. “They’ll try and bring home some economic tangibles. That’s generally where they’ve been able to successfully cooperate in the past.” The two leaders may find less common ground outside of the economic realm, with tensions lingering over territorial issues. Just days before Abe’s trip, Tokyo lodged an official complaint after Chinese ships cruised around the disputed islands that Tokyo calls the Senkaku and Beijing labels the Diaoyu islands. And in September, Japan carried out its first submarine drills in the disputed South China Sea. Japan does not border the South China Sea but has expressed concern about Chinese military activity there. Panda diplomacy?  Abe and Xi are likely to simply avoid those thornier issues, said Kazuyuki Suwa, a professor of political science at the University of Shizuoka. “Neither side will make any compromises... They will say what they need to say, and won’t likely agree to go beyond that,” he told AFP. “The relationship is a mixture of cooperation and confrontation, and that will stay the same.” Much of the meeting will be about optics, with both men looking for the symbolic boost that the summit will provide. Abe will also be hoping to extract a pledge that China will make good on plans for Xi to pay a reciprocal visit to Japan next year. If he succeeds, “that itself should be called one of the major achievements of this trip,” Suwa said. And there may be other diplomatic tools at the ready as well. When Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited Japan earlier this year, he announced a gift of a pair of rare wild crested ibises, which arrived this month. Japanese media have reported Abe is hoping that his visit will produce a bigger bonanza in the form of some panda diplomacy, with zoos in Sendai and Kobe apparently angling for new additions."

Members of the Taliban gather at the site of the execution of three men accused of murdering a couple during a robbery in Ghazni province, Afghanistan on April 18, 2015. The Afghan Taliban will join multilateral peace talks hosted by Russia on Friday, senior Taliban officials said on Monday, after the United States and Afghanistan turned down their invitations. But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said they had not formally agreed to take part. Russia invited 12 countries and the Taliban, who are fighting to re-impose their strict interpretation of Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by US-led troops, but the United States and the US-backed Afghan government declined. Representatives from Iran, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are expected to attend, officials said. The Moscow talks underline the increasingly active role Russia is playing in Afghanistan, decades after Soviet forces withdrew from the country, with business investment plans, diplomatic and cultural outreach and small military support for the central government. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected the invitation on the grounds that talks with the Taliban should be led by the Afghan government. Russia decided to go ahead with the Moscow talks nevertheless, a diplomatic move that has angered Kabul as the meeting could complicate an ongoing US-backed peace process. A five-member Taliban delegation led by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, head of the Taliban's political council in Qatar, will attend. “The majority of our top leaders showed the willingness to participate in the Moscow peace talks though some of them also expressed their reservations and said it would not give them any benefit on the ground in Afghanistan,” said a Taliban member. Some Taliban said the delegation would raise their demands for a withdrawal of all foreign forces, the release of all prisoners and the lifting of a ban on travel. “This is a very good opportunity and we would like to participate and raise our genuine issues,” said another Taliban official. ""We would urge these world powers to help resolve the Afghan issue as per international laws and principles."" Even though Afghan government officials will not attend the Moscow talks, members of the High Peace Council (HPC), an Afghan body overseeing efforts to start peace talks, are expected to attend. A US official said the United States believes all countries should support direct dialogue between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. Diplomatic engagement between the Taliban and the United States gained momentum last month after the US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, met Taliban leaders in Qatar. ""We have been clear that no government, including Russia, can be a substitute for the Afghan government in direct negotiations with the Taliban,"" the US official told Reuters."

China's day is on November 11, or 'Singles' Day' since it's 11/11. China's delivery services were hard at work on Sunday as consumers spent big, as they usually do, on November 11, also 11/11 or 'Singles' Day' as it's been dubbed. Online shoppers in China have shattered last year's record by spending more than $30 billion during the country's annual 24-hour buying frenzy on Sunday, as the tradition marked its 10th year. The spending binge has for years eclipsed Cyber Monday in the US for online purchases made on a single day. The 2018 numbers from just one online retailer, Alibaba, in China more than quadrupled what was reported for all Cyber Monday sales in 2017. This year's tally in China was 27 percent higher than a year ago. It breaks from gloomy forecasts about the world's second-largest economy, which is struggling with a tariff war with the US, a stock market slump and slowing overall growth. Known as Singles Day since it's November 11, or 11/11, the clamour for deals and discounts was heralded with characteristic fanfare by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has turned an unofficial holiday for people without romantic partners into a yearly windfall for digital retailers. A massive screen at Alibaba's gala in Shanghai showed the surging sales numbers in real time. Just before 4pm Sunday, the sales reached 168.2 billion yuan ($24.2 billion) – surpassing the total purchases from last year's Singles Day, according to figures posted online by Alibaba Group. At the end of the 24-hour spree, Alibaba reported sales totalled up to 213.5 billion yuan ($30.8 billion). Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang said the results reflected ""the strength and rise of China's consumption economy."" TRT World's Natasha Hussein has more.  ""Day of gratitude"" Singles Day began as a spoof event celebrated by unattached Chinese university students in the 1990s. In Chinese, it's called ""Double 11,"" after the numbers in the month and date. The improvised holiday was co-opted by e-retailers in 2009 and transformed into China's version of Cyber Monday, as the Monday after Thanksgiving is known. Nearly $6.6 billion in sales were made on Cyber Monday in 2017, up about 17 percent from the previous year, according to Adobe Analytics.  Ren Xiaotong, a 27-year-old accountant in Beijing, said she suspected online stores jacked up their prices in the lead-up to Singles Day so they could declare that items were discounted. But in the end, her scepticism didn't stop her from partaking. ""Singles Day is different now – it has more tricks than before,"" Ren said. ""You only save a few dozens of yuan at the end. That being said, I still bought a pair of shoes, simply to celebrate the festival."" The Twitter-like Weibo platform was blanketed with Singles Day-related posts on Sunday, from users proudly proclaiming that they had resisted the shopping urge this year to those who cheerfully listed an array of mundane purchases. Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who will step down as chairman in less than a year, attended the start of the gala in Shanghai and appeared in a video message in which he wrapped up live hair crabs, a popular online purchase. Singles Day ""is not a day of discounts, but rather a day of gratitude,"" Ma said in the video. ""It's when retailers use the best products and best prices to show their gratitude to our consumers."" Chinese e-commerce platforms have come under fire in the past for peddling low-quality and counterfeit items. Hong Tao, an economics professor at Beijing Technology and Business University, said Singles Day encourages shoppers to prioritise cheap prices over high quality, causing them to purchase items they don't need. ""People are swept up in the festivities,"" Hong said in a phone interview. ""This burst of consumption, confined to just one day, can be exhausting for both buyers and sellers."" The occasion also has big environmental implications. While both Alibaba and competitor JD.com have pledged to use biodegradable packaging to cut down on waste, research conducted this month by Greenpeace East Asia said many plastics marked ""biodegradable"" and used by Chinese e-retailers can break down only under high temperatures in facilities that are limited in number across the country. Greenpeace estimated that by 2020, ""biodegradable"" packaging could produce roughly 721 truckloads of trash in China every day."

Ibrahim Mohamed Solih was inaugurated on Saturday as the new president of the Maldives after the opposition united to dislodge pro-China strongman leader Abdulla Yameen in September elections. At a special session of parliament held at the National Football Stadium in the capital Male, Solih was sworn in with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi among those in attendance. The Maldives foreign ministry said China's culture minister Luo Shugang was also an invitee. Modi's presence was a reflection of the relief felt in India, which has long held sway in the archipelago, and in the West that Yameen was voted out. The United States and the European Union had threatened sanctions if the vote had not been free and fair. Both neighbouring India and Western nations watched with concern as Yameen moved closer to Beijing which loaned the strategically placed archipelago millions of dollars for infrastructure. ""I am confident that my visit will herald a new era of even closer exchanges and cooperation between our two countries,"" Modi said on Facebook, especially in ""infrastructure, health care, connectivity and human resource development."" Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) has pledged to end what it called ""China's colonialism"" and to resist a ""land grab"" in the country which straddles key East-West shipping routes. MDP leader and former president Mohamed Nasheed has vowed his party would reduce reliance on China and renegotiate millions of dollars in loans taken from Beijing. More than 80 percent the Maldives foreign debt is owed to China, he said. Beijing loans China has also loaned other countries around the Indian Ocean and beyond large amounts of money for infrastructure projects as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, alarming the West. Sri Lanka last year granted a 99-year lease on the Hambantota deep-sea port to Beijing, after it was unable to repay Chinese loans for the $1.4-billion project. Mahinda Rajapakse, Sri Lanka's prime minister when Colombo took out the loans, is looking to return to power in the severe current political crisis gripping the island nation. During a recent visit to Colombo in the middle of his election campaign, Solih told reporters that he wanted to repair ties with immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and India. Yameen awarded major infrastructure projects to China while taking away a major airport development from India. He also relied on Beijing for diplomatic support as the Maldives faced international isolation over his dismal rights record. Modi had cancelled his first visit to the country in 2015 after Yameen detained pro-India Nasheed and eventually had him convicted on a terrorism charge and jailed for 13 years."

A statement would be issued by the meeting's chair, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, instead. ""The entire world is worried"" about tensions between China and the US, O'Neill told a mob of reporters that descended on him after he confirmed there was no communique from leaders. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters there were differences between several nations including China and the US Draft versions of the communique showed the US wanted strong language against unfair trade practices that it accuses China of. The two-day summit was punctuated by acrimony and underlined a rising rivalry between China and the West for influence in the usually neglected South Pacific. US-China war of words US Vice President Mike Pence and China's President Xi Jinping traded barbs in speeches on Saturday.  Pence professed respect for Xi and China but also harshly criticised the world's number 2 economy for intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and unfair trading practices. The world, according to Xi, is facing a choice between cooperation and confrontation as protectionism and unilateralism grows. He said the rules of global institutions set up after World War II such as the World Trade Organization should not be bent for selfish agendas. Pence told reporters that during the weekend he had two ""candid"" conversations with Xi, who is expected to meet President Donald Trump at a Group of 20 summit at the end of this month in Buenos Aires. ""There are differences today. They begin with trade practices, with tariffs and quotas, forced technology transfers, the theft of intellectual property. It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights,"" Pence said. The US is interested in a better relationship ""but there has to be change"" from China's side, Pence said he told Xi, who responded that dialogue is important. China's aid and loans In Port Moresby, the impact of China's aid and loans is highly visible. But the US and allies are countering with efforts to finance infrastructure in Papua New Guinea and other island states. The US has also said it will be involved in ally Australia's plan to develop a naval base with Papua New Guinea. On Sunday, the US, New Zealand, Japan and Australia said they would work with Papua New Guinea's government to bring electricity to 70 percent of its people by 2030. Less than 20 percent have a reliable electricity supply. ""The commitment of the United States of America to this region of the world has never been stronger,"" said Pence at a signing ceremony. A separate statement from his office said other countries are welcome to join the electrification initiative provided they support the US vision of a free and open Pacific. China, meanwhile, has promised $4 billion of finance to build the the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, among the least urbanised countries in the world."

Visitors pose for photos outside of APEC Haus, the main venue of the APEC Economic Leaders' Week Summit as the US Navy ship USS Green Bay is anchored just offshore in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. Leaders at the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) failed to agree on a communique for the first time in its history last weekend. The inability of the APEC leaders to reach a consensus reflects deep divisions between the United States and China. “You know the two big giants in the room,” Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said at a closing news conference, when asked which of the 21 members of the APEC group could not agree. During the summit, the US and China had a dispute over which is the better investment partner when it comes to trade and security in the region. Chinese President Xi Jinping dwelled on the economic structure of the world by suggesting free trade.  His stance against protectionism was seen as a veiled comment targeting the Trump policies that have led to the recent trade wars. Xi said: ""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners."" The Chinese leader did not mention his country’s militarisation in the South China Sea or its repressive policies against Muslim Uyghurs. American Vice President Mike Pence stated that the US won’t change its stance against Chinese economic policy. According to the US, the “fair trade”, suggested by China, is a tool with which to exploit the small Pacific countries and make them economically dependent on China. Xi made a push to expand China’s influence in the Pacific on Friday, holding a forum with the leaders of eight small island countries at the Papua New Guinea (PNG) conference. The Chinese president arrived to great fanfare on Thursday and was feted by PNG officials. He stoked Western concern on Friday when he met Pacific island leaders to pitch his Belt and Road initiative.  The United States and its allies, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, countered on Sunday with a $1.7 billion plan to deliver reliable electricity and the internet to PNG. Pence also announced that the US and Australia would build a naval base on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island.  “We will work with these nations to protect the sovereignty and maritime rights of Pacific islands as well,” Pence said. Adding to the electricity plan for PNG, the US involvement in the building of a naval base in Manus Island shows that the confrontation between China and the US is extending from economy to security in the Pacific region. History of the US-China trade war  China has been on Trump's radar since before his inauguration. From the theft of American technological know-how to interventionist policies, Trump has not held back in his criticism of his country’s top trade partner or in doling out punishment. The US slapped a 25% tariff on $34 billion of Chinese goods in early July. Another round of duties on $16 billion-worth of goods went into effect on August 23, bringing the total amount facing a 25% charge to $50 billion. The administration has accused China of pressuring ""foreign companies to transfer technology"" if they want investment, of pursuing ""policies aimed at limiting market access for foreign manufacturers"", and not negotiating trade practices which will help reduce the trade deficit that Trump has made his mission to pare down. The US buys more from China than it sells to the country, a trade deficit of $375 billion, and in order to reduce that deficit — a promise Trump made during his campaign trail — the US levied tariffs hoping consumers would turn to local products and to protect American jobs from what Trump calls “unfair trade practices”, according to a statement released by the White House.   China has fought back with matching tariffs of the same amount on US exports to China. In a tit-for-tat tariff war, the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced a 25% surcharge on $16 billion worth of US goods after the US green-lighted the August 23 tariffs.  The duties imposed by the two countries will push up the prices of 1,300 goods altogether. The 333 goods being targeted by China include vehicles, diesel, gasoline, propane, asphalt, fiber-optic cables, agricultural products and seafood."

The explosion at a chemical factory in northern China comes after a factory explosion in Sanhe township of Dongfeng County, Liaoyuan city of northeastern China's Jilin Province. (November 24, 2018) An explosion and fire near a chemical factory left at least 22 people dead and 22 others injured in northern China on Wednesday, authorities said. The incident near Hebei Shenghua Chemical Co. in Zhangjiakou, a city some 200 kilometres (124 miles) northwest of Beijing, also burned 50 large and small trucks, local media said on its Weibo social media account. The injured were taken to hospital for treatment following the blast, which occurred at 00:41 am, according to the statement. The charred and smoking remains of trucks and cars were scattered on a road as firefighters worked at the scene, according to photos posted on Twitter by broadcaster CGTN. ""On-site search and rescue work and investigation of the cause of the accident are still under way,"" CGTN said. Zhangjiakou will host the Olympic alpine skiing events at the 2022 Winter Games, which Beijing is organising. It was not immediately clear if the explosion was near the site. Industrial, road accidents Road and industrial accidents are common in China. A blast at a chemical plant in southwest Sichuan province left 19 dead and 12 injured in July. The company had undertaken illegal construction that had not passed safety checks, according to local authorities. In 2015, giant chemical blasts in a container storage facility killed at least 165 people in the northern port city of Tianjin. The explosions caused more than $1 billion in damage and sparked widespread anger at a perceived lack of transparency over the accident's causes and its environmental impact. China has also experienced its share of horrific road crashes, with traffic regulations often flouted or unenforced. Two cars ploughed into crowds in two separate incidents in recent days: Five children were killed when a driver deliberately rammed into students crossing a road in northeast China last week and seven people died when another car hit people on a sidewalk in the southwest on Tuesday. An out-of-control truck ploughed into a 31-car lineup in northwest Gansu province earlier this month, killing 15 people and injuring 44. In November last year, a highway pileup involving at least 30 cars killed 18 people in eastern Anhui province."

A South Korea train prepares to travel across the border into North Korea at Dorasan station in Paju, South Korea on November 30, 2018. A train carrying South Korean engineers and officials crossed into the North on Friday to begin a landmark joint survey to reconnect railway tracks between the two Koreas. Linking up the railway systems was one of the agreements made earlier this year in a key meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and the South's President Moon Jae-in. It marked the first time in a decade that a train from the South entered North Korea. TV footage on Friday showed a red, white and blue train - displaying a banner reading ""Iron Horse is now running toward the era of peace and prosperity"" - pull away from the South's Dorasan station, the nearest terminal from the western part of the inter-Korean border. ""This signals the start of co-prosperity of the North and the South by reconnecting railways,"" Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee said. She added the railway reconnection would help expand the country's ""economic territory"" to Eurasia by land, as the division of the Korean peninsula has left South Korea geopolitically cut off from the continent for many decades. The six-carriage train is transporting 28 South Koreans including railway engineers and other personnel, and carrying 55 tonnes of fuel and an electricity generator. There is a passenger coach, a sleeping coach, an office coach and a wagon loaded with water for showers and laundry. When it arrives at Panmun Station - the first North Korean terminal across the border - the six carriages will be linked up to a North Korean train, and the South Korean locomotive will return home. Information gathering The South Koreans and their counterparts will live in the train, inspecting two railway lines for a total of 18 days - one linking the North's southernmost Kaesong City to Sinuiju City near the Chinese border, and the other connecting Mount Kumgang near the inter-Korean border to Tumen River bordering Russia in the east. They will travel some 2,600 kilometres (1,600 miles) on railway tracks together, the transport ministry said. Before the division of the Korean peninsula in 1948, there were two railway lines linking the North to the South - one in the west and the other in the east. As a gesture towards reconciliation, the two Koreas reconnected the western line in 2007 and limited numbers of freight trains transported materials and goods to and from the Seoul-invested Kaesong industrial zone in the North for about a year. But the line has since then been put out of service due to heightened tension over the North's nuclear development programme. The current railway project has also faced delays over concerns it could violate UN sanctions imposed on the North over its nuclear and missile programmes. But the UN Security Council granted an exemption for the joint study last week, although it is unclear whether others will be given as the project progresses. Seoul said the survey was purely aimed at gathering information on the current state of the North's rail system and assured that actual restoration works would come only after consents from the UN. The South's Unification Ministry has earmarked some $56.6 million for next year on the assumption that it will take five years to repair and improve the two railway routes in the North. The North's leader Kim Jong-un, during a summit with the South's President Moon Jae-in in April, said the North's railway infrastructures are ""embarrassingly"" dilapidated, praising the South's high-speed railway system. The North's railway tracks are in such disrepair that trains reportedly operate between 20-45 km per hour. The study comes as differences emerge between Seoul and Washington, which stations 28,500 troops in the South as part of their decades-old alliance. The South's dovish President Moon has long favoured engagement with the nuclear-armed North and has dangled large investment and joint cross-border projects as incentives for steps towards denuclearisation."

So what role can Nepal play as it is stuck between a rock and a hard place? Nepalese army soldiers participate in a parade to mark Constitution Day in Kathmandu, Nepal, Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2018. (AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha) Can landlocked nations protect their sovereignty from military powers? For a realist, the answer is obvious, and this is where Nepal’s future hangs in the balance. Lodged between two emerging powers, China and India, Nepal is no match. After Nepal opted to not partake in the BIMSTEC’s (The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) joint military exercise this September, India expressed its dissatisfaction and termed the move as an embarrassment and inappropriate. Analysts believe Nepal’s move comes after its tilt towards China since Nepal’s participation in the BIMSTEC was limited to an observer, and then later decided to hold a joint military drill in China immediately after the pull-out. Also, Nepal also doesn’t want to isolate Pakistan at a time when India is making every move to do so. China, on the other hand, is hell-bent to seize the diminishing scope of India’s influence. Both India and China are trying to seduce Nepal’s Army through funding. However, China is a step ahead as it has announced it would provide over $21 million to the Nepalese Army for humanitarian and disaster relief equipment. A declassified CIA document, obtained by Wikileaks, revealed that the CIA feared an occupation of Nepal by its immediate neighbours during the 1962 Sino-India war. The document speculates that India was premeditating an occupation of the southern parts of Nepal before 1962: “Nevertheless, we believe that India will pursue a cautious course, lest it jeopardizes its other activities in Nepal. These include the manning of border posts along the Nepalese-Tibetan border and the right to recruit Gurkha troops. There are 29 battalions of Gurkhas totaling about 27, 000 men in the Indian Army. Such rights are dependent upon the King’s pleasure. More important, however, is India’s fear that Mahendra, if pushed too hard, might carry out his threat to seek Communist military support, which would force India to intervene militarily in Nepal. While India could secure the southern lowlands and probably the Kathmandu Valley and other points in Central Nepal, the Chinese—who control two key passes of north Kathmandu—could take over much of northern Nepal and thus greatly increase Indian difficulty in securing its Himalayan frontier.” India was not only miffed with Nepal during the 1962 Sino-China war for not siding with it, but the southern neighbour also imposed an economic blockade on Nepal during 1989 when Nepal decided to buy arms from China. The document also reveals that India has always considered Nepal as a part of its security regime and had intentions to annex Nepal since the East India Company left their country. This argument was given weight when Modi-led India imposed the second blockade on Nepal in 2015 – in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. Why did India react so harshly? Nepal had gone ahead to pass its new constitution and India didn’t really like with it. After the constitution was passed, India also criticised Nepal’s human rights situation at the United Nations (UN) with no self-awareness about the hypocrisy contained within its criticism. Analysts often argue that India is always prying on Nepal’s water resources and that it doesn’t want the Himalayan kingdom to develop because it would mean that India’s demands would no longer be heard or would remain relevant. There’s a famous saying that one can change its friends but not its neighbours, and Nepalis know that all too well. The fact is that China and India will not attack Nepal militarily at this period. There are two main reasons. First, both countries are struggling with their internal problems like Kashmir, Naxalites (Maoist rebels), refugee issues, the rise of secessionist groups, terrorism, climate change, economy, Tibet, Xinjiang. Second, both nations know that occupying Nepal will only invite more trouble. The presence of Nepal’s Gurkha regiment in the Indian army also makes it complicated in the south of the country. Nepal is already trying to reduce its dependency on China by signing a trade pact with China—which now allows Nepal to access several ports. There’s also talk of connecting Tibet and Kathmandu via railways. Military power is often seen as an aggressive tool in the modern world. However, China and India will continue their tussle to seal military dominance in Nepal whether western powers like it or not. On the other hand, it’s only the Nepali leaders who can secure Nepal’s sovereignty in the coming days. With the diminishing role of the United States in global politics and the chances of China becoming the next superpower, Nepal can only wait and watch how the future unfolds for its neighbours and itself too. In the meantime, it should work on becoming the Brussels of South Asia, engage militarily on an international level, lessen its dependency on both China and India, and improve its economy in a meaningful manner."

Huawei Device Co Ltd and Huawei Device USA Inc pleaded not guilty to US fraud, trade secrets conspiracy and other charges, and a trial date was set for March 2020, the Justice Department said on Thursday. The two companies were charged in an indictment unsealed last month that they conspired to steal T-Mobile US Inc trade secrets between 2012 and 2014. The charges have added to pressure from the US government on Huawei, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker. Washington is trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei routers and switches and is pressing allies to do the same. T-Mobile had accused Huawei of stealing technology called ""Tappy,"" which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones. Huawei has said the two companies settled their disputes in 2017. Separately, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have charged Huawei and its affiliates with bank and wire fraud on allegations that they violated sanctions against Iran. An arraignment date is yet to be set in that case, which has added to Washington's tensions with Beijing. The United States is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, after charging her with bank and wire fraud. A senior US cyber official said on Tuesday that European governments were listening to the US message that Huawei exposes telecommunications networks to security risks. No evidence of the securities risks have been presented publicly even as scrutiny on Huawei has intensified and the company has denied Beijing could use its technology for spying."

But it does little law making, serving as a platform to highlight the government's plans for the year and earn endorsement. Delegates attend the opening session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, March 5, 2019. China announced a robust annual economic growth target and a 7.5 percent rise in military spending on Tuesday as it convened an annual legislative session overshadowed by a tariff war with Washington. Seeking to defuse US and European complaints the Chinese system is rigged against foreign companies, Premier Li Keqiang promised in a speech to the National People's Congress (NPC) they will be ""treated as equals"" with their Chinese competitors. Li, the country's top economic official, set this year's growth target at 6 to 6.5 percent, reflecting determination to shore up a cooling, state-dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses. Slightly below last year's 6.6 percent growth, a three-decade low, it would be among the world's strongest if achieved. The premier promised to ""promote China-US trade negotiations,"" but gave no details of talks aimed at ending the fight with US President Donald Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions and complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Li, No. 2 in the governing Communist Party behind President Xi Jinping, pledged higher spending on development of technologies including artificial intelligence, electric cars, biotechnology and new materials that China's leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence. He also promised more money for education, social programs and public works construction. Samantha Vadas reports from Beijing.  China's growing tech prowess worries competitors China's emergence as a competitor in smartphones, telecom equipment, solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices. But it rattles Washington and other governments that worry Chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment. Li warned the second-largest economy faces a ""graver and more complicated environment"" and risks that ""are greater in number and size."" The two-week gathering of the congress's 3,000-plus delegates in the cavernous Great Hall of the People is China's biggest event of the year. It does little law making, but serves as a platform to highlight the government's plans for the year. President Xi Jinping's government is expected to use this year's session to announce tax cuts and more support for entrepreneurs who generate much of China's new jobs and wealth. Legislators also are due to endorse a law that aims to ease tensions with Washington and Europe by discouraging officials from pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. Higher government spending will push the budget deficit from 2.6 percent of total economic output to 2.8 percent, Li said. The plans reflect ""emphatic pro-growth efforts"" to ""offset external headwinds,"" Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank said in a report. Proposed tax cuts of up to 2 trillion yuan ($300 billion) would put ""significant spending power"" in the hands of consumers and companies, helping to buoy sagging demand for autos, household appliances and other goods, Varathan said. Military spending to increase Spending on the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, will rise to 1.2 trillion yuan ($178 billion), according to a separate report issued by the finance ministry. China's total military outlay, the second-largest behind the United States, is estimated by independent experts to exceed $220 billion a year when off-budget expenses are added in. The spending will pay to expand China's navy and acquire advanced aircraft and other weapons to help Beijing enforce its territorial claims in the South China Sea. The slower rise in military spending, down from double digit increases in previous years, reflects changing priorities, said Yue Gang, a military expert and retired Chinese army colonel. ""It is more urgent for China to prepare for a trade war with the US, instead of a physical war,"" Yue said. Military reforms are nearly complete, and ""China needs the money to be used for more urgent matters,"" he said. Tariff war continues The tariff fight with Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions has rattled Chinese consumers and investors, prompting some to put off spending, which could add to downward pressure on economic growth. News reports say Washington and Beijing might be close to an agreement to end the battle. But the chief US envoy, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, said earlier the two sides still had much work to do. No agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute: US pressure on Beijing to roll back its plans for state-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology. Washington, Europe and other trading partners say those violate China's market-opening obligations. Some US officials worry they might erode US industrial leadership. It's unclear if Trump would be mollified by the technology measure, part of a law on foreign investment that state media say the congress is due to endorse. It would bar officials from using ""administrative measures"" to pressure companies to hand over technology. Foreign business groups welcomed the proposal but said they need to see enforcement rules to know whether it will improve conditions. Li tried to reassure investors by promising foreign companies will be ""treated as equals"" with Chinese enterprises in a ""fair and impartial market environment."" Foreign business groups and governments complain Beijing routinely violates its commitments under the World Trade Organization to ensure such equality, or ""national treatment."" They say rules on investment, technology licensing and other facets of business discriminate against foreign companies or shield Chinese enterprises from competition. Xi and other Chinese leaders have announced changes over the past year including tariff cuts on imported consumer goods and plans to allow full foreign ownership in auto manufacturing. But business groups say those have little impact on operating conditions. Beijing faces a WTO challenge filed in July by the European Union against technology licensing rules the 28-nation trade bloc said improperly hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology. Li promised ""competitive neutrality,"" or equal treatment of state-owned and private companies by regulators. But he gave no details of how far that might extend for foreign competitors. ""Enterprises under all forms of ownership will be treated on an equal footing,"" the premier said."

Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen on a big screen as his Premier Li Keqiang delivers the work report at the opening session of the annual National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Tuesday, March 5, 2019. China has unveiled a $298 billion tax cut plan in order to prop up its slowing economy after US President Donald Trump launched a trade war against Beijing.  The Chinese parliament introduced a new budget plan at the opening of the country’s annual meeting on Tuesday, offering tax cuts for all companies. The manufacturing, transport and construction sectors are all expected to benefit from the plan. Taxes will be slashed by almost $298 billion in 2019. Beijing will cut the rate of value-added tax (VAT) for manufacturers to 13 percent in 2019, from the current level of 16 percent. The VAT rate will also decrease from 10 percent to nine percent for the transport and construction sectors. As the growth rate of the Chinese economy slowed following US-imposed tariffs on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars last year, Beijing has now taken new measures to reignite its economy, using tax cuts as the first line of defence to reverse the losses.   Li Keqiang, the country's top economic official, set this year's growth target at 6 to 6.5 percent, reflecting determination to shore up a cooling, state-dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses. China aims to create more than 11 million new urban jobs this year and keep the urban unemployment rate within 4.5 percent, in line with its 2018 goals. At the same time, it will cut social security fees paid by companies. Trade Wars Since Trump came to office, he has questioned Chinese trade practices. In 2017, the US introduced tariffs on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars. Beijing responded with retaliatory tariffs. The world's two biggest economies have also been engaged in an economic conflict over US allegations that China steals technology and forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in an aggressive push to challenge American technological dominance. Together with tariffs which were already imposed, both sides threatened each other for imposing further tariffs. In December, both countries reached an agreement to delay new trade tariffs for 90 days, however, both sides are still yet to reach an agreement. Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), warned countries about a new storm that will hit the world’s economic output in a talk at the World Government Summit in Dubai on February 10. In January, the IMF revised down its projection for global economic growth for 2019 to 3.5 percent from the 3.7 percent it estimated only three months earlier."

But many Uighurs and Xinjiang experts say the violent episodes stem largely from spontaneous outbursts of anger at Chinese cultural and religious repression, and that Beijing plays up terrorism to justify tight control of the resource-rich region. Bachelet said she was confident that ""stability and security in this region can be facilitated by policies which demonstrate the authorities' respect of all people's rights."" TRT World's Julia Lyubova has more from Geneva.  Seeking freedom for Saudi women activists Bachelet also called on Saudi Arabia to release women activists allegedly tortured in detention after authorities accused them of harming the country's interests. Activists have named 10 Saudi women held for their campaigning, voicing fears that they could face harsh sentences. Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor is preparing the trials of detainees, identified by watchdog groups as women's rights activists, after completing its investigations, state news agency SPA said last Friday. ""Today, allow me to voice my concern at the apparently arbitrary arrest and detention, and alleged ill-treatment or torture, of several women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia,"" Bachelet said. ""The persecution of peaceful activists would clearly contradict the spirit of the country's proclaimed new reforms,"" she added. The Saudi deputy public prosecutor told Saudi-owned newspaper Alsharq Alawsat last week that his office had looked into media reports that the women were tortured and found no evidence, calling the reports ""false."" Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced reforms that have reduced discrimination, such as the lifting of the driving ban for women. But activists say women who led such campaigns remain behind bars and that some have been tortured since their arrest in May. The Gulf Centre for Human Rights, in a report issued in Geneva on Monday, that some Saudi activists have been subjected to torture including electrocution, flogging, whipping, and sexual assault. Murder of journalist Khashoggi European countries will urge Saudi Arabia on Thursday to release activists and cooperate with a UN-led probe into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in the first rebuke of the kingdom at the Human Rights Council, diplomats and campaigners told Reuters. Khashoggi, a critic and Washington Post columnist, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. US intelligence agencies believe the crown prince ordered the operation, which Riyadh has denied. In June 2018, the public prosecutor said the female detainees had admitted to communicating and cooperating with individuals and organisations opposed to the kingdom, state news agency SPA reported."

Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking at the opening of the Belt and Road Forum is displayed on a big screen near decorations depicting Chinese Admiral Zheng He who commanded expeditionary voyages across Asia and East Africa in the 15th century and a modern high speed train in Beijing, China In recent years, there has been renewed global interest in the ‘rising continent’ of Asia which suffers from a massive infrastructure deficit even though it represents the world’s largest market with the highest middle-class spending pattern. China has taken the lead in capitalising on these massive trade opportunities through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which envisions an interlinked Eurasia through a synchronised train, road and maritime routes. Initially, the European Union (EU) expressed interest in this attractive project but it later opted to stay away from the widely attended Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in 2017.   Even the European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker’s Juncker Commission had been researching similar ventures to boost economic growth in the EU.  The EU then came forward in October 2018 with a holistic, multi-dimensional Global Strategy of its own, visualising a vibrant and ‘connected Asia’. Benefiting all stake-holders, the mega-project would not only bring the backward region on par with the developed world it would also create fresh opportunities for European companies like the Trans-European transport network. However, to implement the plan the EU would have to make a yearly investment of 1.3 trillion euros, with more funding required from the private sector. Considering that the BRI is already underway and has offered similar solutions, the EU could have simply pitched in and achieved its economic objectives. Most of all, this can benefit Germany and Eastern Europe the most as Frankfurt exports goods worth nearly $600 billion US dollars to China every year (at the rate of 1 million USD per minute) while there are sizable Chinese investments in eastern European countries.  Both China and the EU had successfully upgraded economic cooperation with each other over the past few years, with the EU joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) while China became part of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). With no significant disputes between China and the EU a sustainable, long-term geo-economic alliance could have been achieved under the BRI umbrella, however, Europe has preferred to work independently. The EU foreign affairs representative Federica Mogherini said, “Our approach is the European Union’s way to establish stronger networks and strengthen partnerships for sustainable connectivity.” Termed 'The European Way to Connectivity', from the beginning, the ‘EU Corridor’ project made it apparent that Brussels has proposed a competitive alternative to China’s BRI. Considering the overlapping goals of both geo-economic projects in mostly the same region, it seems like several factors may have prevented Brussels from becoming an active participant in the BRI. For starters, elevated Chinese economic engagement in the Central and Eastern European countries has become an unsettling factor. Actively engaged in the production and transport network in this developing region, China’s leverage was bound to grow in Europe and some eastern European countries, especially those with some history of communism. Searching for strategies to contain this new influence, France and Germany finally suggested the adoption of a common investment screening policy to streamline China’s spending. However, this move immediately started protests from eastern European states in the bloc. Second, the current trade war frictions between the US and China have hit European companies working in China. The eurozone was emerging as “the big loser” in this economic tussle as it failed to define a single policy for dealing with both China and the US. In the midst of all this, pitching in its lot with the BRI would most certainly bring Europe into the Chinese zone of influence, and it is more likely that Brussels does not want to give that impression. Another factor could have been the legal standing of all issues pertaining to the Belt and Road Initiative. Special BRI courts were to operate in Xian, Shenzhen and Beijing along with three international commercial courts under the auspices of the Supreme People’s Court to settle all disputes and carry out arbitration under the Chinese legal system. This may be because most of the BRI projects are implemented by Chinese organisations, but as far as the EU was concerned, it would prefer to follow international legal norms. Finally, there always were some minor grey areas in this relationship, the EU had often expressed concern over human rights protection and fundamental rights issues in China. Questioning China’s foreign investment practices, at times the EU had conveyed that it would appreciate more reciprocity and transparency. Mulling over a bilateral investment treaty to reduce trade barriers, the EU has kept China’s ‘market economy’ status on hold. Significantly, the EU’s disapproval of BRI became obvious when 27 out of 28 EU ambassadors to China became signatories of a negative document about the BRI last year. Meanwhile, the Chinese stance has been that “the leaders of China and the EU have reached consensus on seeking synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and the EU’s connectivity plan.” Predictably, trade can be the decisive factor here in determining the future of both these mega-projects as Beijing remains Brussels’s biggest trade partner while the EU is China’s second-largest trade partner after the US. Considering this co-dependence, it is unlikely that either side would play a negative role."

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (C) during a press conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing, Friday, March 8, 2019. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met the press Friday morning on the sidelines of the second session of the ongoing 13th National People's Congress (NPC). Repeating history's mistakes with Venezuela The Chinese government’s top diplomat warned against interference in Venezuela or imposing sanctions on the South American nation, saying history offered a clear lesson about not meddling. “The internal affairs of every country should be decided by their own people. External interference and sanctions will only exacerbate the tension situation, and allow the law of the jungle to once again run amuck,” Wang said at his annual news conference at the NPC. “There’s already enough of such lessons from history, and the same old disastrous road should not be followed.” China has repeatedly called for outsiders not to interfere in Venezuela’s internal affairs. By not taking a side in the dispute pitting President Nicolas Maduro against the head of Congress and self-proclaimed 'interim president' Juan Guaido, Beijing is both hedging its bets on the outcome of the confrontation, while implicitly supporting Maduro as the incumbent leader. Wang repeated China's call for the government and opposition to seek a political solution via peaceful dialogue, to ensure the country’s stability and people’s safety, Wang added. Since he declared himself interim president on January 23, most Latin and Western nations have recognised opposition leader Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state. Countries backing Maduro include Cuba, Russia, Turkey and Iran. Washington has pledged to “expand the net” of US sanctions on Venezuela, including more on banks supporting Maduro’s government. Beijing has lent more than $50 billion to Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements over the past decade, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. China has been stepping up its engagement in Latin America, to the concern of Washington, which has reacted particularly strongly to several nations there recently ditching diplomatic ties with self-ruled Taiwan in favour of China. Last month, US National Security Advisor John Bolton requested cooperation with El Salvador to counteract what he called the “predatory” expansion of China. El Salvador abandoned Taiwan last year. Wang said that China-Latin America relations had achieved great progress and were not aimed at any “third party."" Wang on Kim and Trump Wang said last week's failed North Korea-US summit in Vietnam was nevertheless an ""important step"" toward denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula. The talks between Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and US President Donald Trump collapsed over mistaken assumptions each side brought to the table about what the other side was willing to give up in order to get what it wanted. The Chinese foreign minister said the talks were, however, ""worthy of full recognition."" He encouraged the two countries to ""remain patient,"" and noted that many issues concerning the peninsula ""cannot be solved overnight."" The Kim-Trump summit was foreshortened and ended with a statement or deal after a dispute over how much sanctions relief Washington should provide Pyongyang in return for nuclear disarmament steps. China is the DPRK's only major ally, but adheres to UN sanctions over the North's nuclear programs. The China-US relationship and Huawei ""The China-US relationship has gone through a lot in the last 40 years. We have made historic progress, but also face new challenges,"" Wang said. He added that competition between China and the US was normal, but the key was to see the bigger picture. He said China and the US should and would avoid confrontation since the interests of the two countries are already inseparable. However, the foreign minister promised ""all necessary measures"" to defend Chinese companies and citizens abroad amid legal clashes between tech giant Huawei and Washington. Wang said recent legal action against Chinese companies and individuals was ""deliberate political suppression."" Wang was responding to a question about Beijing's stance on Canada's arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou on US criminal charges. Meng faces possible extradition to the US. Huawei on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the US, aimed at overturning restrictions on sales of its telecom equipment. China's government has demanded Canada release Huawei's chief financial officer. Wang gave no details of what Beijing might do, but a Canadian former diplomat and a businessman have been arrested in China in what is widely seen as an effort to pressure Canada."

President Donald Trump meets Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, March 7, 2019, in Washington. With support for Washington’s enduring trade war with China wavering in Europe, US President Donald Trump welcomed Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis to the White House on Thursday for high-profile talks on cybersecurity the former hopes will help cement an ally in the European Union. The EU in recent weeks has grown increasingly divided over warnings from the US that Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei Technologies would develop high-speed, fifth generation wireless technology known as 5G to commit espionage. Countries like Britain, Germany and France have thus far fallen short of imposing stricter guideline against Huawei, while the Czech Republic’s cybersecurity agency issued a warning in December affirming Washington’s accusations. Mr. Babis has meanwhile shown an increased willingness to work with American businesses in recent months. The meeting with Mr. Trump comes on the same day that Huawei announced that it is suing the U.S. government, alleging that moves made to restrict its business there were “unconstitutional.” Huawei has also threatened to sue the Czech Republic for similar reasons. “Our countries will work to ensure secure and reliable telecommunications networks and supply chains to reduce the risk of malicious cyber activity,” the two leaders said in a joint statement yesterday. “We resolve to deepen our cooperation in this area and to work together bilaterally and multilaterally to develop telecommunications security principles.” Like several countries in Central Europe, the Czech Republic has been seen in recent years as growing closer to China with President Milos Zeman meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping in Prague back in 2016 to bolster ties. Since then, Mr. Zeman has personally facilitated a deal with Huawei to develop the country’s first 5G network. The most recent accusations against Huawei caused a split between the two Czech heads of state. Mr. Zeman has disregarded the accusations against Huawei as unsubstantiated, going so far as to disavow his own country’s cybersecurity agency following the December warning, while Mr. Babis ordered his office to stop using Huawei equipment. The Prime Minister would also meet with Apple CEO Tim Cook and AT&T chief John Donovan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying afterward that he’d invited AT&T to develop 5G in the Czech Republic and that Cook had agreed to open an Apple store in Prague. Often referred to as the Czech Donald Trump, Mr. Babis is currently the Czech Republic’s second richest person, and much like Mr. Trump is no stranger to controversy, implicated in several scandals from conflicts-of-interest to espionage. He was elected in 2016 at the height of Europe’s nationalist movement, running on an anti-establishment, anti-migrant platform. “I perfectly understand your plan: how to make America great again,” he told Mr. Trump during his meeting yesterday. “I have a similar plan to make the Czech Republic great again.” Jiri Pehe, a political analyst at New York University in Prague, said that the highly coveted meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House would serve as a way for Mr. Babis to raise his profile at home among a constituency of Czechs who have often taken to the streets in opposition to him. “He is trying to use this meeting to deflect the perceptions of him at home, not to speak of the fact that he likes the limelight and to be seen with powerful western figures,” he said. In addition to cybersecurity issues, Mr. Trump and Mr. Babis also discussed enhanced energy diversification, the NATO alliance, Ukrainian sovereignty and trade, with Mr. Babis hoping to convince Mr. Trump to back down on threats to impose new tariffs on automobiles imported from the EU. “Czech Republic doing very, very well economically and in all other respects,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s always been a safe country. Strong military. Strong people. We have a very good relationship with the Czech Republic and the United States. We do a lot of trade.”"

Reuters The crash of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 on Sunday has raised serious safety questions after becoming the second deadliest accident the aircraft model has suffered within six months. The plane involved in Sunday’s crash was only four months old when it took off from Addis Ababa for Nairobi. China's aviation regulator says it has grounded almost 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft that were operated by its airlines on Monday. Ethiopian Airlines and Cayman Airways have also grounded their jets The 737 MAX 8 had another deadly crash just six months ago, plunging into the ocean 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, leaving all 189 passengers and crew dead. It was operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air. By the end of January, 350 Boeing 737 MAX 8 had been delivered to customers, with a further 4,754 on order. There are no reports of other airlines or regulators grounding the aircraft.  Boeing said it will postpone Wednesday's planned ceremonial debut of the 777x in Seattle after Sunday's crash. The company said it is now focused on 'supporting' the Ethiopian Airlines. Should the safety of Boeing 737 MAX 8 be questioned? The Ethiopian Airlines plane, which crashed six minutes after take-off, was only four months old. In the accident on March 10, the victims represented more than 33 nations, including 22 members of United Nations' staff. As China grounded the 737 MAX 8 jets, the US said they are unsure what information China was acting on. Since there is no further information about the cause of the Ethiopian crash, US officials said there are no plans from their side to ground the 737 MAX 8 jets. Moreover, US officials said that the 737 MAX 8 had a stellar safety record in the United States. Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin said the grounding was “reasonable and justified”. He also said that he did not anticipate a major issue since Chinese airlines operated fewer than 100 of the craft, compared with a combined fleet of more than 2,000 planes. Global reaction to the second deadly crash Indonesia said it would monitor its airlines operating the 737 MAX 8, including Lion Air and Garuda Indonesia. It did not mention any plan to ground the planes. US operators, Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc said they remained fully confident in the aircraft, yet were still following the investigation closely. According to information given on Boeing Co's website, Turkish Airlines has ordered forty 737 MAX 8 aircrafts. So far Turkish Airlines has not released a statement. Singapore Airlines Ltd, whose regional arm Silk operates the 737 MAX 8, said that it is monitoring the situation closely, but its jets will continue to operate as scheduled. South Korea is conducting an emergency inspection on two Eastar Jet 737 MAX 8 planes, the transport ministry said. Fiji Airways and flydubai said they were confident in the airworthiness of their 737 MAX 8 fleets. Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd said it was too early to comment on the Ethiopian crash or its effect on the thirty 737 MAX 8 jets it has ordered. Air Niugini, which has ordered four jets, said it had “full confidence” in the Boeing product. Ethiopia has declared Monday a day of mourning. "

North Korean leader Kim Jong -un bids farewell to the crowd before boarding his train to depart for North Korea at Dong Dang railway station in Vietnam on  March 2, 2019 UN experts say they are investigating possible violations of United Nations sanctions on North Korea in about 20 countries, from alleged clandestine nuclear procurement in China to arms brokering in Syria and military cooperation with Iran, Libya and Sudan. The expert panel's 66-page report to the Security Council, obtained Monday by the Associated Press, also detailed the appearance in North Korea of a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Mercedes-Benz limousines and Lexus LX 570 all-wheel drive luxury vehicles in violation of a ban on luxury goods. And it noted a trend in North Korea's evasion of financial sanctions ""of using cyberattacks to illegally force the transfer of funds from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges."" The report's executive summary, which was obtained in early February, said North Korea's nuclear and missile programs ""remain intact"" and its leaders are dispersing missile assembly and testing facilities to prevent ""decapitation"" strikes. The full report said ""the Yongbyon nuclear complex remained active,"" noting that satellite imagery through November showed excavation of water channels and construction of a new building near the reactors' water discharge facilities. Satellite imagery also ""indicates possible operation of the radiochemical laboratory and associated steam plant,"" it said. The panel said it continues monitoring uranium concentration plants and mining sites in the country. It also has ""surveyed, confirmed and reported ballistic missile activity sites and found evidence of a consistent trend"" by North Korea ""to disperse its assembly, storage and testing locations,"" the report said. In addition to using civilian facilities, the panel said North Korea is using ""previously idle or sprawling military-industrial sites as launch locations"" — some close to, and some up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the assembly or storage sites. As examples of this trend, it cited the test launch of Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missiles from the Panghyon aircraft factory on July 4, 2017, and a launch from Mupyong-ni 24 days after that. It said Pyongyang's Sunan International Airport, the country's largest civil-military airfield, was used to launch Hwasong-12 missiles on Aug. 29 and Sept. 15 of that year. Trade sanctions As for trade sanctions, the experts said they continue to investigate two Chinese companies on the UN sanctions blacklist — Namchogang Trading Corp. and Namhung Trading Corp. — and associated front companies and their representatives ""for nuclear procurement activities."" The panel said it is also currently surveying the world's manufacturers of nuclear ""choke point"" items such as ""pressure transducers,"" focusing on their end-use delivery verification methods. The experts said they also were continuing ""multiple investigations into prohibited activities"" between North Korea and the Syrian regime leader Bashar al- Assad. These include Syrian nationals reported to be engaged in arms brokering on behalf of North Korea ""to a range of Middle Eastern and African states, reportedly offering conventional arms and, in some cases, ballistic missiles, to armed groups in Yemen and Libya,"" the panel said. They also include North Koreans working for sanctioned ""entities"" and for Syrian defense factories, it said. The experts said a country, which they didn't identify, had informed them that Iran ""was one of the two most lucrative markets"" for North Korean military cooperation and that both the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. and Green Pine Associated Corp. offices in the country ""are active."" The unnamed country also indicated that North Koreans in Iran were being used as cash couriers, the report said. The Iranian government replied to the panel that the only North Koreans in the country were diplomats, and they have not violated UN sanctions, the report said. The panel said it is continuing investigations into ""multiple attempts at military cooperation"" between North Korea and various Libyan authorities and sanctioned ""entities"" and foreign nationals working on their behalf. The experts said they are also continuing investigations into military cooperation projects between North Korea and Sudan, including information on activities involving a Syrian arms trafficker and technology for ""anti-tank and man-portable air defense systems."" Denuclearisation must not be incremental The Trump administration will insist North Korea follow through on its commitment to completely eliminate its nuclear weapons before the US agrees to the lifting of international sanctions, the State Department's special envoy for North Korea said Monday. In his first public comments since President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, envoy Stephen Biegun said ""the missing variable"" in making a deal is the North's unwillingness to offer complete, verifiable denuclearisation. ""We are not going to do denuclearisation incrementally,"" Biegun said at a conference sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He said there is room for ""confidence-building"" measures, such as a proposed establishment of a US diplomatic liaison office in North Korea, to advance the process. But the US will not agree to a step-by-step approach to eliminating the nuclear weapons, he said. Biegun said that at last month's Hanoi summit, Trump rejected Kim's offer to eliminate a portion of his nuclear program in exchange for lifting ""basically all"" of the international sanctions. That was judged to be unacceptable, Biegun said, because it would have removed economic pressure that had been imposed by the international community. Under the Kim proposal, ""We'd lift that pressure in exchange for only a portion of those weapons of mass destruction programs,"" Biegun said. ""That would have put us in a position — a very difficult position — of essentially subsidising what would potentially be ongoing development of weapons of mass destruction in North Korea. We need a total solution."" He said this does not mean the US  position has hardened. He said Washington remains open to further North Kore a diplomacy aimed at four priorities: transforming relations, establishing a formal end to the Korean War, achieving the North's complete denuclearisation, and returning the remains of thousands of US troops missing from the Korean War. Last August, North Korea turned over 55 boxes of war remains; so far the US has identified three soldiers from those remains and is expecting to announce several more soon."

Sam Brownback, US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, said China has done nothing to assuage concerns from the US and others over the detention of Uighurs, Kazakhs and members of other Muslim minority groups. ""We've been putting out very clearly that this is a horrific situation that's taking place in Xinjiang,"" Brownback said in a telephone news conference with reporters, referring to the northwestern region that is home to most Chinese Muslims. ""It is just a very tragic and I think a horrific situation there,"" he said. China has already angrily protested Brownback's earlier remarks last week in Hong Kong criticizing Beijing's polices toward religious minorities and accusing the country of being ""at war with faith."" China's officially atheist Communist government at first denied the existence of the internment camps in Xinjiang, but now says they are vocational training facilities aimed at countering Muslim radicalism and separatist tendencies. China says Xinjiang has long been its territory and claims it is bringing prosperity and development to the vast, resource-rich region. Many among Xinjiang's native ethnic groups say they are being denied economic options in favor of migrants from elsewhere in China and that their Muslim faith and unique culture and language are being gradually eradicated. The camps sprang up over the past two years at extraordinary speed and on a massive scale, as monitored by satellite imagery. China maintains a massive security presence in Xinjiang and efforts to independently verify claims by Uighur activists are routinely blocked. Brownback appeared undeterred by Beijing's complaints over his earlier comments, describing China's explanation of the reasons behind the camps as ""completely unsatisfactory answers."" China is already listed by the US among the worst violators of religious freedom, and Brownback held open the possibility of sanctions and other punitive measures ""if corrective actions aren't taken."" While making no commitments, Brownback held open the possibility of action toward individuals involved in the internments under The Global Magnitsky Act of 2016. The act makes it possible to impose entry bans and targeted sanctions on individuals for committing human rights violations or acts of significant corruption. Brownback also contrasted Beijing's attacks on religion with the tolerant approach of governments such as that of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that China claims as its own territory. He said Washington would continue to push for dialogue among all faiths to promote religious freedom worldwide. ""The administration is serious about religious freedom matters and deeply concerned about what's taking place in China,"" Brownback said."

The city government statement said 3,500 medical workers at 16 hospitals had been mobilized to treat the injured, dozens of whom remain in critical condition. The cause of the blast remained under investigation. China experiences frequent industrial accidents despite orders from the central government to improve safety at factories, power plants and mines. Among the worst accidents was a massive 2015 explosion at a chemical warehouse in the port city of Tianjin that killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers.  The blast was blamed on illegal construction and unsafe storage of volatile materials.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is aimed at bolstering Beijing's economic and political reach.  However, critics say it is a Trojan Horse that will let China get control of sensitive technologies and critical infrastructure. Multiple deals signed Italy's populist government, anxious to encourage exports and investment as the economy suffers its third recession in a decade, has played down such worries and gave Xi a red-carpet welcome normally reserved for its closest allies. Chinese and Italian firms signed 10 additional deals, including in the energy, steel and gas pipeline sectors. Full details of the contracts were not immediately revealed, but a government source said they could potentially be worth up to 20 billion euros ($22.62 billion). Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who also serves as industry minister, signed the Belt and Road memorandum of understanding with China's He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission. They were flanked by Xi and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. The Chinese president is due to fly to the Sicilian city Palermo later on Saturday for a private visit before heading to Monte Carlo and then France on Sunday."
